<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It all started when I was asked to look at a
couple of oldish email programs. R&J had tried
to set them up but found that the 2 programs
could not forward their emails.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So I abandoned Yam and spent the rest of the day
and much of the evening experimenting and trying to
figure out why they could'nt get them to function properly.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a time,I found myself enjoying this so much
that I eventually ended up looking at a fairly wide
variety of email programs. Some were shareware while others
were offered as free.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem that these ppl were facing was
not exactly a new one. In fact, it was the old
problem of having to fill in data that on some
ocassions were hard to distinguish - especially
if one was not used to making distinctions
between incoming and outgoing mail server syntax.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And to be honest, I could sympathise (at least
on some ocassions) why it proved difficult.
It was often due to the programmer assuming that
all amiga users held degrees not only in Amiga OS
but also in advanced analog and digital modem telecommunications.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Had they owned proper versions of these program, they could
simply have referred to the instructions contained in the docs.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Looking back now, I am quite amazed how we have advanced.</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oddly enough, it seemed quite easy in the very early days,
yet modem technology was in its infancy. I don't recall having
to fill out reames of info back around the late 80s-early 90s,
just basic items like telephone number, seria baud rates
(9,000 was extreme tops then), password etc -  when we pressed "connect",
the modem activated and we were thrilled when our written words
sped on (intact) to far away places.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But TBH, there were not all that many places one could visit then.
It was mostly bulletin boards and the ocassional (keen) amiga
user who braved asking newly forming internet companies for
personal ISP access. Protocols such as Zmodem and words like "tosser",
(yes it was a recognised term) "TrapToss", "Fidonet", CompuServe, CIX,
Hayes compatible command, RS232 & parity were among some of the common
lingo back then.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the early 90s, the likes of NComm, Term & Terminous 2 had
come along and these brought us an elementary form of GUI to our
A500s and A2ks. Web pages from all manner of firms and sources
started to appear almost overnight.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this time, many keen Amiga programmers worked hard at code
on their A500s (often through the dark hours of the night) and then
offered us their newly formed beta email creations. </P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">It was quite exciting times back then. Pity after Commodore's demise
and series of takeovers it all seemed to go belly up :( </P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the email progs I experimented with yesterday include:</P></font>
<BR><font color=silver>
<UL>
<LI> AEMail - John Zacharias
<LI> Monsoon - Gary Colville
<LI> NAP_Mailer - Michael Graeber (German)
<LI> ADMail - (Simon Brown)
<LI> Eucalyptus - Paul Schifferer - (beta version)
<LI> NetMail - by Ricardo Solmi - uses ZedRexx.
</UL>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">I linked some to GoldED 4 for email writting (one or two progs offer
users a choice between internal or external letter editing).</P></font>

<font color=silver><CENTER>Machine used: </CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">A2k with Blizzard 060-50mhz +PII gfx, MultiCardIII via a somewhat old
97 version of Genesis as TCP/IP stack (I normally use Miami) via
an external PC 56K Aztech modem.</P></font>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Inst string I used was AT&F&D2 which attained speeds on a par
with my Robotics Courier modem.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's been an eventful day. I enjoyed setting up and using these programs
(they all still appear to work well enough) but TBH, it's good to get
back to Yam<font color=white> :)</font></P>
