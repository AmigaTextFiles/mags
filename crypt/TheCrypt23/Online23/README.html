      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  file  is  for those of you that have booted this edition of <font color=red>The
      Crypt <font color=aqua> from floppy disk.  If you are reading <font color=red>The Crypt <font color=aqua>either<font color=white> "on
      line"<font color=aqua>,  or from the hard drive download from our website, then please
      read no further.</P>

                          <font color=yellow><CENTER> For The Floppy Disk Users.</CENTER><P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the  past <font color=red> The Crypt<font color=aqua> was created on floppy disks and converted to
      run  from  hard  disk on its completion.  This was very difficult and
      also  very  time consuming!  Imagine having to decide from day one of
      starting  a new edition how many disks would be required when all you
      had  was  perhaps  a  couple  of  loading  graphics  and  maybe a few
      articles? A crystal ball would have been very useful to us!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Times have changed now and there are very few floppy disk users left.
      <font color=red>The  Crypt<font color=aqua>  is  therefore  now  compiled  on hard drive and copied to
      floppy  as  we build up the magazine.  This is much easier and faster
      for  us  at <font color=green>RIYAN Productions<font color=aqua> and the time saved is spent in bringing
      you a better and bigger edition.</P>

                   <font color=yellow><CENTER>Will The Crypt Still Run From Floppy Disk?</CENTER><P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes,  because  your reading it now.  However as you continue your way
      around  this  edition  you will soon see the main differences.  There
      will  be  more  and  more prompts for you to insert a different disk.
      Obviously  if you had several floppy drives the disk changes would be
      less frequent.  In theory if <font color=red>The Crypt<font color=aqua> came on 5 disks and you have 5
      disk drives you wouldn't have any trouble at all!</P>


                  <font color=yellow><CENTER>So How Do I Transfer The Crypt to Hard Drive?</CENTER><P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Easy folks..</P> 

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">1)<font color=aqua>  Create  a  drawer  somewhere  on  your hard drive and name it<font color=red> The
      Crypt (number)<font color=aqua>.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">2)<font color=aqua> Now copy ALL the contents of DISK 1 to it. </P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">3)<font color=aqua> Next  in  that drawer make two new drawers and name them PICS and
      TEXT.</P>




     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 4)<font color=aqua>  Look  at  DISK  2  and  apart from the disk icon you will see two
      drawers,  PICS  and TEXT.  Copy all the files in PICS drawer into the
      PICS drawer on your hard drive.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">5)<font color=aqua> Now do the same for the TEXT files.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> 6)<font color=aqua> Now do exactly the same for the rest of <font color=red>The Crypt<font color=aqua> floppy disks.</P>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 7)<font color=aqua> Job complete.  If you followed these simple instructions correctly
      <font color=red>The  Crypt<font color=aqua>  will  run  from hard disk.  There are no assigns to worry
      about as the IconX script takes care of that when you double click on
      <font color=red>The Crypt<font color=aqua> Icon.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">8)<font color=aqua> Enjoy<font color=yellow> <B>YOUR</B><font color=aqua> magazine.</P>
