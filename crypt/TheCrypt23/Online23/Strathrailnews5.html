<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  train that departed from Grantown West on October 18th  1965
really  was  the  last  one  ever!  was  how  Strathspey  Railway
director,   John  Partridge  concluded  his  presentation  to  the
Highland  Rail  Partnership at their  meeting  on  12th  February.
Unless,   that  is,  the funds can be found  to  provide  what  is
becoming  known as the Gaich tunnel as part  of  the  A95  Trunk
road realignment south of Grantown on Spey where the road and  the
route of railway cross.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  a  presentation  to  the  Partnership  outlining  the  growing
development of the Strathspey Railway,  Mr.  Partridge was drawing
attention  to the one off opportunity that currently  exists  to
make  provision for the railway to again serve the historic  town.
By  extending the railway it gave it new purpose he  said.   It
would  open Grantown to the potential of the national rail network
(the  Strathspey  already  has   through  working  of  the  Royal
Scotsman),   give  it a new high quality tourist  attraction  and
provide  potential for the redevelopment of freight.  In  addition
it would give Strathspey a tourist attraction of national scale.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  major obstacle to achieving these objectives was the crossing
of  the  A95.   As  currently planned the work will  be  completed
within the 2002/03 financial year and if it is completed with  out
the  tunnel the opportunity would be gone for a  long  time  and
may never return.  The cost of providing the facility is not known
but  could be around £200,000/£250,000 but whatever the price  the
Strathspey Railway was not in a position to fund such  an  amount.
Regrettably  the  Scottish Executive as Trunk Road  Authority  and
The  Heritage Lottery Fund had declined to assist and ERDF funding
could  not be available until 2004 by which time it would  be  too
late. (Continued)</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  the  positive  side,  Highland Council are giving  their  best
support  and  with  additional   input   from  the  Highland  Rail
Partnership he felt that the sources of funding may be able to  be
unlocked in time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the  event  the  Partnership backed  the  Railways  proposals
unanimously  and agreed to propose to the Scottish Executive,   in
the  strongest terms,  that the Executive should fund  the  entire
cost  of  the improvements including the tunnel.  Highland Council
are  also initiating an investigation into alternative sources  of
funding for the project.</P>
