<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">After just a few years of marriage, filled with constant arguments, a young
man and his wife decided the only way to save their marriage was counseling.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They had been at each other's throat for some time and felt that this was
their last straw. When they arrived at the counselor's office, the counselor
jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion. "What seems to be the
problem?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Immediately, the husband held his long face down without anything to say.
On the other hand, the wife began talking 90 miles an hour describing all
the wrongs within their marriage.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After 5 - - 10 - - 15 minutes of listening to the wife, the counselor went
over to her, picked her up by her shoulders, kissed her passionately for
several minutes, and sat her back down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Afterwards, the wife sat there speechless. He looked over at the husband who
was staring in disbelief at what had happened.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The counselor spoke to the husband, <font color=lime>"Your wife NEEDS that at least twice a
week!"</font></P><font color=lime>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The husband scratched his head and replied, <font color=yellow>"I can have her here on Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 9:00."</font></P><font color=yellow>
