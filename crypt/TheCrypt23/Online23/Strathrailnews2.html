<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  window  of  opportunity   has   opened  with  regard  to  the
Strathspey Railways long held objective of
reinstating the line to Grantown-on-Spey.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of  the  major hurdles that has to be overcome in taking  the
line to the site of the former West Station in

the  town is how to cross the A95 trunk road.  Subsequent  to  the
lines closure in 1965 the road was

realigned  to  avoid  a double right hand  bend  under  the  route
crossing it instead at about track level. To

rebuild  the  track  on its original formation  would,   with  the
present alignment of the road, require a level

crossing,  a feature that has long been recognised by the  railway
company as a non starter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,   thanks  to  a  large  programme  of  road  improvements
announced by the Scottish Executive in April

this  year  the section of the A95 in question is to be  up-graded
in the next financial year. The potential to

include  provision for the railway to pass under the new alignment
was quickly realised by the Strathspey

and  discussion  to this end has been taking place  between  them,
The Executive, Local Authority and BEAR

the company who are responsible for the maintenance of the road.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While much remains to be negotiated and agreed a significant  move
of support came at a Highland Council

Committee meeting on 22nd November.  At this meeting it was agreed
that they should join with the

Strathspey  Railway to seek a suitable funding  package  including
an application for PTF funds to ensure that

the  tunnel provision is included in the works. The company  sees
this move as recognition by the Council of

the  potential  value in extending the railways services  to  the
historic town of Grantown. It is also

recognition/





recognition  of  the  logic,   in  civil  engineering  terms,   of
including provision for the railway at this stage albeit

that  connection  to the line extending from the present  railhead
north of Broomhill Station and from it to the

West Station site is yet some time off.</P>



<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">Notes to Editor:  1.  The full Resolution of the Roads,  Community
and Protective Services Committee reads:</P>
<font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agreed  that the Committee join with the Strathspey  Railway  Co.
Ltd. to seek a suitable funding package

including an application for PTF funds to ensure that  the  tunnel
provision is included in the works and

report  back  on the capital consents and revenue consequences  of
options available.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.   PTF  Public Transport Fund  was set up in November 2000  by
the then (Scottish) Transport Minister,

Sarah  Boyack,   to  assist  public  transport  projects.   It  is
available only to local authorities and their

partners.  In the context of the Committees decision some form of
partnership between the Railway and the

Council will,  presumably,  have to be agreed. Initial funding was
£150 million.
