<center><h2><font color=yellow>The Game  </font></h2></center><blockquote>
  <p> If you take Silicon Graphics rendered animations, 16 bit sound, six thousand 
    voice lines to interact with, Including Robert Llewellyn from Red Dwarf playing 
    the main part of Feeble,  and 80 locations to play in, this is a big game 
    to play in. Mind you it takes a big Amiga to play it on. I was using an A4000T 
    with a Blizzard 060 and a Picasso IV graphics card, and it was just about 
    playable, but really you would need a fast PPC to run it at full speed as 
    all the animations were a bit jerky on my machine, but all the sound files 
    played well and controlling Feeble wasn’t a problem. You will also need 700mb 
    of space on your hard drive.</p>

<center><h2><font color=yellow>The Background</font> </h2></center><blockquote>
<p>You are Feeble, an alien living in a highly oppressive society - controlled 
  by 'The Company' and its clan of Enforcers. Everyone on the planet, including 
  members of 'The Company', <span class=GramE>are</span> controlled by the god- 
  like <span class=SpellE>Omnibrain</span> - a collection of 'neural tissues with 
  intense computational powers'.<br>
  The aptly named <span class=SpellE>Feeble's</span> insignificant existence turns 
  full circle when his ship collides with the Voyager probe whilst he is navigating 
  an asteroid belt after returning home from a very successful `Crop Circle` run 
  on Earth. The repercussions of <span class=SpellE>Feeble's</span> joy-ride come 
  to a climax when the off-course Voyager collides and destroys a Company installation 
  unit. Soon the blame is put on Feeble, and in true Company style, Feeble is 
  arrested and sent to a high security prison, where he meets the most influential 
  person in his mission, die hard revolutionary and member of the Rebellion, Delores. 
  Together they team up, joining forces with a military robot, on a mission to 
  reveal the truth about the Company, destroy the <span class=SpellE>Omnibrain</span>, 
  and give freedom back to the people.<br>
  <br>
  Rebellion has never looked so <span class=SpellE>pAtHeTiC</span>!!!</p></blockquote>

<center><h2><font color=yellow>The Review  </font></h2> </center><blockquote>
<p>I only had the game for a few days, as we were sent a copy from <a href="http://www.forematt.free-online.co.uk"> Forematt Home Computing </a>
 to review the game for them, but I found it very easy to get into the 
  game from the start, and those of you who liked the Simon the Sorcerer games 
  will be in your element with this one as there is plenty to do and see. The 
  game is the `Point and Click` type of <span class=GramE>game,</span> and the 
  icons are easy to access either from the keyboard or the usual left and right 
  click on the mouse. </p>
<p>Some of the dialogue can be a bit annoying after you’ve heard it a few times, 
  but a quick bash on the Space Bar will skip them. Similarly you can also skip 
  the movie sequences by pressing F5. </p>
<p>Another handy part of the game is the Oracle Database that you can call up 
  anytime in the game by clicking the icon in the top left hand corner of the 
  screen. As this brings up the Encyclopaedia Section with all the information 
  you need about the people places and objects throughout the mission, also the 
  Stats screen will tell you how many laws you have broken so far. You also have 
  an option to save the game, and the Info screen gives hints and clues as to 
  what you should be doing next. </p>
  <p>As the game progresses you will also be able to access SAM, <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Feeble’s</span></span><span>  </span>robot friend. 
    <span class=GramE>Where you will be able to use <span class=SpellE>SAM’s</span> 
    Tractor Beam and a variety of weapons of mass destruction.</span></p>

<center><h2><font color=yellow>Conclusion </font></h2> </center><blockquote>
<p>So what do you get for your money?</p>
<p>You get 2 CD’s and a booklet in a nice sturdy case, though one of the CD’s 
  is loose in a paper insert. I would preferred to have seen both the CD’s  secured 
  in there own holders. Plus you get 700mb of interactive game that is great fun 
  to play on the Amiga.</p>
  <p>So if you like the Simon the Sorcerer and <st1:place>Valhalla</st1:place> 
    games then this is one game that I know you are going to enjoy.</p>
  <p>This game is available to buy now from our sponsors <a href="http://www.forematt.free-online.co.uk"> Home Forematt Computing </a></p>
