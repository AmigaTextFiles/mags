<font color=yellow><CENTER>Some people have a phobia 'bout creepy crawly things</CENTER>
<CENTER>And break into a cold sweat,  with the terror that it brings</CENTER>
<CENTER>They can't abide those insects,  that do nobody harm</CENTER>
<CENTER>And blindly panic whenever one settles on their arm</CENTER>

<font color=yellow><CENTER>Some hate arachnoid presences, when soaking in the bath,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And try to hide their panic behind a nervous laugh</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or squeal with fear as one comes near until it drowns itself</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then flick it with a well aimed brush high up onto a shelf.</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Others afraid of mice and rats invariably include cats</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who stalk all day all manner of anything that flaps</CENTER>
<CENTER>They'll hiss and spit and growl at these in ferociousness they say</CENTER>
<CENTER>But come along a small mouse,  and it's just please go away !</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Snakes are another good source for terror to inflict</CENTER>
<CENTER>There's those that live in horror,  and those who have it licked</CENTER>
<CENTER>Around her place at half eight,  you cuddle with your girl,</CENTER>
<CENTER>While round your feet a python then silently does curl.</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>O.K.!  she says,  let's bungee jump,  so off to town you go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's fine until you're at the top - the wind begins to blow.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The platform sways from left to right, and back and forth as well,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Congratulations, you've just found another living hell !</CENTER></font>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Another girlfriend on the cards - well that'll be just right</CENTER>
<CENTER>One with a quiet demeanour,  to cuddle with at night</CENTER>
<CENTER>And when you ask me what I do, 'cause I'm a total lamer,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I smile and announce quietly<font color=white> "Why I'm a Lion Tamer"</font></CENTER>
