<p>There is legend that goes like this: In a bar in New York there is a magical 
  mirror. If you go up to it and tell it the truth it will grant you a wish. If 
  you lie - POOF it swallows you up.</p>
<p>A brunette, a blonde and a redhead walk into this bar. They head straight for 
  the mirror and the redhead goes first. She says &quot;I think I'm the most beautiful 
  woman on Earth&quot; POOF - the mirror swallows her up. </p>

 
<p>The brunette goes up and she says &quot;I think I'm the sexiest woman on Earth&quot; 
  POOF - the mirror swallows her up.</p>
<p>Last is the blonde. She says &quot; I think........&quot; POOF!!</p>

<p>One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of Chicken Little to 
  her class. She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little tried to warn 
  the farmer.</p>
<p>She read, &quot;.... and so Chicken Little went up to the farmer and said, 
  &quot;The sky is falling, the sky is falling!&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher paused then asked the class, &quot;And what do you think that farmer 
  said?&quot;</p>
<p>One little girl raised her hand and said, &quot;I think he said: 'Holy Shit! 
  A talking chicken!'&quot;</p>

<p>Whilst working in Drumchapel Glasgow she was in the local primary school one 
  day and was telling the infants the story of the three little pigs.</p>
<p>She reached the part in the story about the wolf coming too the second house 
  which was made of wood.</p>
<p> &quot;Let me in let me in by my chinny chin chin or I'll huff and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow bloooooow your house down!&quot;</p>
<p> One little tot in the front of the class turned to his pal and said in all 
  innocence, &quot;He's a b******d that big wolf, isn't he!&quot;.</p>

  Two elderly women were eating breakfast in restaurant one morning. Ethel noticed 
  something funny about Mabel's ear and she said,&quot; Mabel, did you know you've 
  got a suppository in your left ear?&quot;</p>
<p> Mabel answered, &quot;I have? A suppository?&quot; She pulled it out and stared 
  at it.</p>
<p> Then she said, &quot;Ethel, I'm glad you saw this thing. Now I think I know 
  where my hearing aid is.&quot;</p>

<p>When the husband finally died his wife put the usual death notice in the paper, 
  but added that he died of gonorrhea. </p>
<p>No sooner were the papers delivered when a good friend of the family phoned 
  and complained bitterly. &quot;You know very well that he died of diarrohea, 
  not gonorrhea.</p>
<p>&quot; Replied the widow, &quot;I nursed him night and day so of course I know 
  he died of diarrhea, but I thought it would be better for posterity to remember 
  him as a great lover rather than the<br>
  little shit he always was.&quot;</p>

<p>An elderly couple was on a cruise and it was really stormy. They were standing 
  on the back of the boat watching the moon, when a wave came up and washed the 
  old woman overboard. </p>
<p>They searched for days and couldn't find her, so the captain sent the old man 
  back to shore with the promise that he would notify him as soon as they found 
  something. </p>
<p>Three weeks went by and finally the old man got a fax from the boat. It read: 
  &quot;Sir, sorry to inform you, we found your wife dead at the bottom of the 
  ocean. We hauled her up to the deck and attached to her behind was an oyster 
  and in it was a pearl worth $50,000. please advise.&quot; </p>
<p>The old man faxed back: Send me the pearl and re-bait the trap.</p>

<p>A funeral service is being held for a woman who has just passed away. At the 
  end of the service, the pall bearers are carrying the casket out when they accidentally 
  bumped into a wall, jarring the casket.<br>
</p>
<p>They hear a faint moan! They open the casket and find that the woman is actually 
  alive! She lives for ten more years, and then dies.<br>
</p>
<p>Once again, a ceremony is held, and at the end of it, the pall bearers are 
  again carrying out the casket. As they carry the casket towards the door, the 
  husband cries out: &quot;Watch that wall!&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#D7289A">------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p>Two elderly ladies had been friends for many decades. Over the years they had 
  shared all kinds of activities and adventures. Lately, their activities had 
  been limited to meeting a few times a week to play cards.</p>
<p> One day they were playing cards when one looked at the other and said, &quot;Now 
  don't get mad at me...I know we've been friends for a long time... but I just 
  can't think of your name! I've thought and thought, but I can't remember it. 
  Please tell me what your name is.&quot;</p>
<p> Her friend glared at her. For at least three minutes she just stared and glared 
  at her. Finally she said, &quot;How soon do you need to know.&quot;</p>

<p>Two old men were sitting on a park bench outside the local town hall where 
  a flower show was in progress. One leaned over to the other and said, &quot;Good 
  Grief, life is boring. We never have any fun these days. For two bucks I'd take 
  my clothes off and streak through the flower show!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You're on!&quot; said the other old fellow, holding up two dollars.</p>
<p> As fast as he could, the first old man fumbled his way out of his clothes 
  and, completely naked, streaked through the front door of the Town hall.</p>
<p> Waiting outside, his friend heard a huge commotion inside the hall, followed 
  by loud applause. The naked old man burst out through the door surrounded by 
  a cheering crowd.</p>
<p> &quot;How did it go?&quot; asked his friend.</p>
<p> &quot;Great!&quot; said the streaker, &quot;I WON FIRST PRIZE AS A DRIED ARRANGEMENT!!!&quot;</p>

  It's Saturday morning. Bob's just about to set off on a round of golf when he 
  realizes that he forgot to tell his wife that the guy who fixes the washing 
  machine is coming at noon. So Bob heads back to the clubhouse and phones home.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; says a little girl's voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, honey, it's Daddy,&quot; says Bob. &quot;Is Mommy near the phone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Daddy. She's upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Frank.&quot;</p>
<p>After a brief pause, Bob says, &quot;But you haven't got an Uncle Frank honey!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I do, and he's upstairs in the bedroom with Mommy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, then. Here's what I want you to do. Put down the phone, run upstairs 
  and knock on the bedroom door and shout to Mommy and Uncle Frank that daddy's 
  car just pulled up outside the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Daddy!&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the little girl comes back to the phone. &quot;I did what 
  you said, Daddy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Mommy jumped out of bed with no clothes on and ran around screaming; 
  then she tripped over the rug and fell down the front steps and she's just lying 
  there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God! And what about Uncle Frank?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He jumped out of bed with no clothes on, and he was all scared and he 
  jumped out the back window into the swimming pool. But he must have forgot that 
  last week you took out all the water to clean it, so he hit the bottom of the 
  swimming pool and is just lying there too, not moving.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a long pause, then Bob says, &quot;Swimming pool? We don't have a 
  swimming pool... Is this 858-7039?&quot;</p>

  An elderly spinster called the lawyer's office and told the receptionist she 
  wanted to see the lawyer about having a will prepared.</p>
<p>The receptionist suggested they set up an appointment for a convenient time 
  for the spinster to come into the office.</p>
<p>The woman replied, &quot;You must understand, I've lived alone all my life, 
  I rarely see anyone, and I don't like to go out. Would it be possible for the 
  lawyer to come to my house?&quot;</p>
<p>The receptionist checked with the attorney who agreed and he went to the spinster's 
  home for the meeting to discuss her estate and the will. The lawyer's first 
  question was, &quot;Would you please tell me what you have in assets and how 
  you'd like them to be distributed under your will?&quot;</p>
<p>She replied, &quot;Besides the furniture and accessories you see here, I have 
  $40,000 in my savings account at the bank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; the lawyer asked, &quot;how would you like the $40,000 
  to be distributed?&quot;</p>
<p>The spinster said, &quot;Well, as I've told you, I've lived a reclusive life, 
  people have hardly ever noticed me, so I'd like them to notice when I pass on. 
  I'd like to provide $35,000 for my funeral.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer remarked, &quot;Well, for $35,000 you will be able to have a funeral 
  that will certainly be noticed and will leave a lasting impression on anyone 
  who may not have taken much note of you! But tell me,&quot; he continued, &quot;what 
  would you like to do with the remaining $5,000?&quot;</p>
<p>The spinster replied, &quot;As you know, I've never married, I've lived alone 
  almost my entire life, and in fact I've never slept with a man. Before I die, 
  I'd like you to use the $5,000 to arrange for a man to sleep with me&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very unusual request,&quot; the lawyer said, adding, &quot;but 
  I'll see what I can do to arrange it and get back to you.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening, the lawyer was at home telling his wife about the eccentric spinster 
  and her weird request. After thinking about how much she could do around the 
  house with $5,000, and with a bit of coaxing, the wife got her husband to agree 
  to provide the service himself. She said, &quot;I'll drive you over tomorrow 
  morning, and wait in the car until you're finished.&quot;</p>
<p>The next morning, she drove him to the spinster's house and waited while he 
  went into the house. She waited for over an hour, but her husband didn't come 
  out. So she blew the car horn.</p>
<p>Shortly, the upstairs bedroom window opened, the lawyer stuck his head out 
  and yelled, &quot;Pick me up tomorrow! She's going to let the County bury her!&quot;</p>
