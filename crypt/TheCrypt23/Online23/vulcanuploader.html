<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Creating  websites can be fun but uploading them  to  your  server
can  sometimes  be  a  painful chore,  especially  if  you  create
content  for  multiple domains or find yourself  with  many  files
that  need updating on a regular basis.  Vulcan created a tool  to
make  their life easier,  it's called the Vulcan Uploader  and  it
allows you to upload or update your websites with just one click.</P></FONT

><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you're  a  webmaster then it might also make your life  easier
and  now  is  the perfect time to find out,  as Vulcan are  giving
this application away for free!  There are no restrictions and  no
registration is required,  so simply download it from this website
and  away you go!  If you've got time,  have a quick read of  it's
features as the Vulcan Uploader is not intended (in any  way)   to
be  a replacement FTP application but simply a tool that offers  a
fast  and  simple  solution  to  an  otherwise  slow  and  complex
procedure.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
