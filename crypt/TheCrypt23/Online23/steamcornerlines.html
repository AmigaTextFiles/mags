<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hello again. This time out, we're going to have a look at places 
  to go to maybe re-kindle a part of that lost youth, or show the kids something 
  different to the "Playstation", if yours are anything like mine! Wherever possible, 
  I'll give details of additional places of interest, so there should be something 
  for all the family, including the ladies! Also, we'll be having a look at signaling 
  through the ages, for those of a more technical bent. Thanks go to Mr. I. Fyvie, 
  Mr. S. Smalley, Mr. A. Wood (Watercress Line), and countless others for contents.</P>

  <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A classic example of a country branch line, which runs most weekends.  Set in the 
Leicestershire area of Twycross, this superb little railway sports an excellent period 
museum within Shackerston station,  displaying artifacts from the Edwardian era .  
Trains run up the line to the Bosworth Battlefield Visitor Centre,  which is situated 
on the battlefield site.  If you're careful about your planning,  you'll get to meet " 
The Howard Household";  these are a re-enactment society who put on a most 
impressive display, complete with tents, armour etc. (This was a big hit with my lad- 
"Better than the Playstation" to quote his words), as they don't mind a "hands-on" 
approach and will provide an interesting brief about the times and weapons that 
they display from the 1500's.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also not too far away is Twycross Zoo,  providing a good general entertainment for 
most families at a loose end.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All of this, and a stone's throw away from the A444,  between the M42, junction 
11 and Hinckley !   A great day's outing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Situated at Blythe Bridge,  Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs.,  this is a delightful example of an 
Industrial branch line,  with over thirty historic engines on view at Caverswall Road 
Station. A five mile round trip through Staffordshire countryside with a stop at the 
woodland halt or Dilhorne Park provides a pleasant walk to Dilhorne, an ancient 
moorlands village. A recent purchase is winding gear at Foxfield Colliery, and 
volunteers are always needed.  Information can be obtained on 01782 396210,  or 
visit http:www.foxfieldrailway.co.uk .</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Originally the Peterborough branch connecting with Rugby and Market 
Harborough,  this preserved line also runs and displays continental rolling stock and 
locomotives,  giving it an international flavour. </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wansford station is an excellent example of architecture reminiscent of the 
L.N.W.R.,  and sports adequate car-parking and facilities for visitors, including the 
disabled.  The sheds here have guided tours for visitors,  and catering facilities are 
also available,  along with a well stocked visitors' shop.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A trip on the railway includes a visit to Wansford tunnel,  which is reputedly 
haunted,  then a leisurely trip up to Peterborough North,  passing various halts en 
route.  At these, one can enjoy countryside walks,  with an information centre and 
static exhibits at Peterborough,  which is two minutes walk from the B.R. station,  
and sited on the old loco shed grounds,  where once a loco is reputed to have 
been driven too fast onto the turntable during the war with a wash in the Nene as 
a result.  Regretfully,  the original station is now a car-park.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There's some good shops to be found too,  so the ladies need not be "at a loose 
end".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nene Valley Railway is accessible via Stibbington village, 
  southbound off the A1 from the A47 junction, and services run most weekends. 
  For those with larger appetites, the transport cafe at the junction of the A1 
  provides a good meal.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Probably my favourite amongst preserved branch lines,  running between 
Kidderminster and Bridgenorth.  The flavour here is decidedly GWR,  and 
demonstrated at it's very best.  A very handy rail-link exists at Kidderminster with 
the station within a few feet,  providing easy access to the historical GWR station,  
which also boasts an excellent car-park.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A miniature railway and visitors' centre are provided at the old goods shed, and 
snacks are available.  Disabled access is fine, too.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bewdley station sports a fine example of a GWR footbridge,  and occasional 
shunting duties can be observed here,  along with loco maintenance.  The viaduct 
at the northern end of the station is of interest to  photographers and architectural 
students alike,  and provides an excellent view when travelled upon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The line terminates at Bridgenorth,  which sports some excellent shops and a rack 
and pinion railway provides easy access to the town.  Here,  the bulk of 
engineering for the line is carried out at the main sheds, including several preserved 
diesel locos.  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Definitely worth a visit in my opinion !</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Running between Loughborough and Birstall and Belgrave (Leicester North),  the 
Great Central offers the only example of a preserved Main Line,  with on-going 
work to produce a twin track run throughout it's length.  Admission to the loco-
sheds at Loughborough is included,  and whilst there,  pay the signal-box some 
attention.  </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The station offers excellent facilities including a buffet, 
  which is highly recommended, and an inbuilt museum, which you shouldn't miss. 
  Other stations on the line have been characterised to depict different eras, 
  even down to working gas lamps, and enameled advertising boards in the original 
  style.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plans are in the making for further extending the line northwards in towards 
Ruddinton, and an extension to the Leicester North site to include a visitors centre 
and engine shed complete with turntable,  giving the visitor a wider range of 
interest.  The line is depicted as was during it's B.R. heyday,  giving rise to locos 
from various regions.  Special "windcutter" freight demos and "Master Cutler" 
services are also available.</P>
