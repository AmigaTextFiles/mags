<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aviemores  Strathspey Steam Railway reports  a  great  year  with
revenue  figures  likely to be the best  ever  since  the  railway
started operations in 1978.  With the December programme of  Santa
trains  and mince pie specials concluding the season the five  and
half  mile  steam railway is expecting to be ahead of  last  years
income with ticket and shop sales likely exceed the £300,000  mark
for the first time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  success  of this year is being put down to hard  work  and  a
positive outlook early in the year when the foot & mouth  epidemic
threatened  to  undermine rural tourism.   The  railway  committed
itself  to  taking  on  seasonal staff and running  its  published
services  unless instructed by the authorities to halt operations.
Work  on the northern extension of the line between Boat of Garten
and  Broomhill was suspended for a time to minimise  any  risk  of
railway workers accidentally spreading foot and mouth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  a  year  which  saw  the  official   launch  into  traffic  of
locomotive 46512 after a 27 year restoration project  the  railway
has  continued to make progress on a variety of fronts.   Work  on
the  extension  restarted in June and  track  squads  carried  out
resleepering and ballasting along the line throughout  the  summer
with  such success that a mainline track machine was hired in  for
the  week  beginning 5th November to carry out levelling,   lining
and packing of the line.  As a result of all this work the railway
has  committed itself to opening the line to Broomhill on the  1st
June 2002 .</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broomhill  station is used as Glenbogle in the Monarch  of  the
Glen  television  series and is featured in  two  scenes  in  the
current series.  From the 1st June 2002 the station will  see  its
first  regular  services since closure  took  place  on  the  18th
October 1965,  a gap of nearly 37 years after the last train  ran.
The  Strathspey  Railway has had to rebuild the station  buildings
at  Broomhill  as  well  as  constructing  four  miles  of  track,
repairing  a number of bridges in addition to giving attention  to
8  miles  of fencing.  Highland Council had to build a new  bridge
over  the road from Boat of Garten to Nethy Bridge to replace  the
original  bridge demolished for road improvements  in  the  1970s.
Most  of the work involved in rebuilding the line has been carried
out  by  volunteers who are looking forward to the  First  Day  of
June next year.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  number  of tour operators who are major customers of the  steam
railway  have  already  indicated that they  will  be  undertaking
return  journeys  from Aviemore to Broomhill next  year  and  this
bodes  well for the success of the railway next year.  The railway
will  continue  to be worked on the one engine in steam  principle
and the round trip will take approximately 90 minutes.  During the
Thomas  event  in August trains will only run  between  Aviemore
and  Boat  of  Garten on the Saturdays and Sundays  so  that  more
trains  can  be run during the day (Thomas trains  will  run  to
Broomhill  Monday to Friday during Thomas week).   Santa  trains
will  also keep to the current format of running between  Aviemore
& Boat of Garten.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  the  rest  of  the year the railway will be concentrating  on
maintenance and repair of locomotives,  carriages  and  wagons  in
addition  to  essential  work on the  track  and  progressing  the
extension.  The railway has ceased operating trains for the winter
except for the Santa and Christmas/Hogmanay holiday services.</P>
