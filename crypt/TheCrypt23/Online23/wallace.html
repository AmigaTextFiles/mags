<blockquote>
<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Documented  historical   evidence   of  the  line  of  Wallace  is
confusingly  split.   Some say he is descended  from  Richard  the
Welshman,   dating back to the times of William  the  Conqueror  -
others have him traced back to the traditional Scots line  of  the
Cragies.  For reasons of simplicity and to keep with the theme  of
these pages,  which focus manly on William Wallace and the reasons
and  situations that made him 'Scotland's greatest  hero',   we'll
keep  to  the  facts that are well known and true as  much  as  is
possible.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Wallace,  second of three sons of Sir Malcolm Wallace  was
born on January 1272,  (although many will debate the year to fall
somewhere  between  1270 and 1276 - 1272  seems  to  be  the  most
precise  in  my  research),  in Scotland in the town  of  Elerslie
(known now as Elderslie - see "Wallace Family").</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His father,  Sir Malcolm Wallace,  although endowed with the title
of  a  knight  held little rank in the world of politics  and  the
nobility of Scotland.  He owned a certain amount of land under his
title and lived a relatively peaceful life.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Scotland that William Wallace was raised in during  the  late
1200's  was  a  wealthy  country far  removed  from  the  beggarly
picture of a nation which English propagandists were to paint.  It
is  plain to see from the Great Cathedrals which still stand  from
Glasgow  in the south to as far north as Dornoch.  The magnificent
abbeys  and  monasteries  in Arbroath,   Scone,   Dunfermline  and
Cambuskenneth as well as the great palaces and house  in  Paisley,
Kilwinning,  Crossraguel,  New Abbey, Dundrennan, Holyrood, Kelso,
Jedburgh, Dryburgh and Melrose.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  clear that these marvelous buildings could only have  been
erected  in  a  country  possessed   of  considerable  wealth  and
resources.  Studded with hundreds of Castles,  regal, baronial and
knightly,  the fortified homes of the landed classes:  it  was  an
age in which emerged a prosperous bourgeoisie.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  powerful King Alexander II was on the throne and had not only
the  ability  but  the  standing to fend  off  possible  invaders.
Around the time of Wallace's birth the then king of England,  King
Henry  III  died and was succeeded by the man who  would  one  day
become William's deadliest adversary - Edward I (Longshanks).   On
August  18th 1274 Edward was crowned at Westminster.   He  was  35
years old,  tall, well proportioned and considerably above average
height, he certainly deserved his nickname of Longshanks.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William  Wallace  also grew up to become  a  powerful  and  sturdy
young  man,   with a height of 6 foot 7 inches and a  physique  to
match,  he too was a giant of a man.  It is often debated that  it
would have been impossible for such a man to exist in a time  when
the average height of a man was little over 5 feet.  However,   to
judge  by the clothing and armour of the time it is clear  to  see
that  not only was Longshanks a towering figure,  even by  today's
standards, but so was William Wallace.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  also  clear  to see that in a time when to  be  considered
'middle aged',  one would only have to be somewhere in the  region
of  20-25 years of age.  In order for a man to become a leader and
be  successful in battle he either had to have been born into  the
rank,  or like Wallace,  earn the rank by feats of battle.  In  an
era where strength,  stamina,  endurance,  courage and, above all,
skill  in  handling  the  sword   and  dagger  were  of  paramount
importance  in  the  emergence of leaders -  when  warlike  renown
depended so essentially on a personal deeds of daring it would  be
impossible for him to be anything less than what he was.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had  Wallace not been a man of considerable strength by what other
means  could  the second son of an obscure knight,  a  mere  youth
just  out  of  his teens,  without the support or patronage  of  a
single noble,  have maintained himself, attracted followers, stuck
fear  into  the  enemy  during face-to-face combat,   secured  the
hatred of Edward Plantagenet I of England,  and become the hero of
a  nation  if  he  did  not  possess  quite  exceptional  physical
strength and prowess?</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,   it  is  not  only his physical  attributes  which  made
William  Wallace  such  a   hero,    his   mental  faculties  were
considerable.  Where, and when, exactly William Wallace gained his
education is a long and in-depth story which involves the  telling
of  a  rather  long  tale.  In order to keep things  simple  we'll
reflect  on  the  disruptions  which  were  in  place  before  the
crowning of John Balliol.  Sir Malcolm Wallace was called to  bear
arms in a revolt know as 'the revolt of the Turnberry Band'.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  idea was to issue a levie which would gather a force together
in  support  of the House of Bruce.  William now  at  the  age  of
fourteen  would surely have been page or esquire  to  his  father,
and  possibly his elder brother,  also called Malcolm.  This would
have been his first taste of military action,  but the revolt - if
it  can  be  called  that - fizzled out before it really  started,
peace and tranquillity reigned but that meeting on September  1286
had  an  important part to play in future events.   For  around  3
years  there was an uneasy peace within Scotland - the calm before
the  storm  if  you like - and it is during this  time  of  secret
meetings  and coming and going that William would have spent  some
time  at  Dunipace in east Stirlingshire where he lodged  with  an
uncle,  a younger brother of his father, who was the cleric there,
at a chapelry of Cambuskenneth Abbey.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William  was  showing his intellect that he could  easily  make  a
career in the Church,  which was the traditional role for landless
younger  sons.  Now at the age of 16 his education  was  taking  a
more  mature  direction.  His uncle instilled in him moral  maxims
compactly framed in Latin,  and referred frequently to  the  great
classic  authors.   William's passion and love  of  liberty  which
would  become  his  basis  for his glorious  career  can  also  be
credited  to his uncle-priest who inculcated the very  values  and
essence  of  freedom and liberty with in his  mind.   This  was  a
precept  which  remained firmly implanted in William's  mind  till
the end of his days.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">United  again  with his family,  and now 17 years old,   something
else  was to happen which would take William into the care of  the
church.   During the time of his education (14 -  16  years  old),
John  Balliol  had  been  exiled  and  in  order  to  restore  the
Gaurdians of Scotland back into govern Scotland they first had  to
pay  homage  to Longshanks.  The taking of this  oath  had  to  be
outright,  and the deadline for taking the oath was set  for  July
of that year.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responsibility for administering the oath for Ayrshire  fell  upon
the  hands  of Sir Ranald Craufurd,  William's grandfather  -  his
mothers father.  Anyone not paying homage to Longshanks was in for
severe  penalties,  and when Sir Ranald noticed that  Sir  Malcolm
Wallace's  name  was  not  on   the   list,   and  realising  that
retribution  from the English garrisons,  which now  governed  Ayr
and  Irvine (where they were),  was about to descend upon  Malcolm
he took his daughter and her younger sons under his care.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir  Malcolm  and  his  oldest son fled  north  leaving  his  wife
Margaret and two youngest sons William and John behind.   After  a
short  while with Margaret's father Sir Ranald,  he sent them  all
to  Kilspindie  in the Carse of Gowrie where  they  were  kept  by
another uncle of William's - probably a brother of his mothers.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  was  the custom in those days,  the younger brothers  followed
the  education of the church while the eldest would inherit  lands
and title's.  The uncle which he was now with was also a priest of
the  district and it was here,  now at the age of 17  or  18  that
William  continued  his education in Dundee.   It  was  here  that
William met John Blair,  who soon after became a Benedictine monk,
following  that  he eventually left his monastery  to  attend  his
friend William and become his chaplain and comrade in arms.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  this  church school William also met and became  friends  with
Duncan  of Lorn and Sir Neil Campbell of Lochawe,  both young  men
like  William  who  were to take a major part in  William's  first
exploits.  Why such a well built and physically strong youth would
follow  the  career  of a priest is easily answered.   As  I  have
already  said it was the custom for both the Wallace  family  (his
fathers side)  and the Craufurd family (his mothers side)  to send
the  youngest  sons  to the church for their  education,   and  in
unsettled  times as there were,  it was prudent  to  have  a  firm
grasp  on languages and politics and the learning's of the church,
as the church was a major power.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also with his older brother Malcolm and his father Sir Malcolm  on
the run in the north it was clear that William,  being the largest
and  strongest family member would be in a good place to take care
of his mother and his younger brother John.  Oddly enough,  Dundee
was  also  one  of  the few places at this time  where  there  was
little  revolt  against  the English takeover  -  he  could  sleep
safely out of the way of the troubles.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the  film  'Braveheart',   both  writer  Randall  Wallace  and
Director Mel Gibson will have you learn that William's mother  was
already dead.  They also do not mention his younger brother  John,
and  in  the  first half hour or so they kill off his  father  and
older  brother  when William was just a small  boy.   This  is  of
course not true.  However, in saying that, it is clear to see from
the  brief  outlook I have given you here that  should  they  have
gone  into  this  in any detail at all then the  film  would  have
easily  been twice as long and we could have all been fast  asleep
by the time all the good bits started!</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  may  have felt,  in their judgment,  that these points  were
fairly  insignificant  compared to  William  Wallace's  feats  and
daring.   Personally I feel that it wouldn't have taken  too  much
time  to explain the situation surrounding his education  and  his
family in a more accurate light.  These comments in mind, it would
make  the  situation  of him traveling south  after  his  families
death  to  live  with  his  uncle and his graveside  meeting  with
Murron totally fictitious. But it did make for a good movie.</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The situation in Scotland was building into civil war, infighting between rival families and rival towns was heating up, as well as the fight against English occupation. Brawling turned to riots - riots turned to ambush and sporadic battles. Sir Malcolm Wallace was back in the south with his son Malcolm when one of these ambush type battles in 1291 at Loudoun Hill in Irvine saw the death of William's father. This was the start of William's personal resentment of the English which would later develop into utter hatred.</P></font>

<font color=aqua> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was now around 19 years of age, his mother was devastated and his older brother Sir Malcolm Wallace junior was now the head of the family. This is now the time for William to cast of the binds of the church and turn to his sword for the first time. He had grown up watching the people around him (his kinfolk) being split by infighting backed by the hand of the English. The cruel treatment of his oppressed country, the exile of his mother into hiding, the death of his father by an Englishman called Fenwick at a minor scuffle in Irvine: it was all too much for this 19 year old boy in a giants body to take.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Throughout his life so far he would have been protected as a scholar of the church and the talk on the lips of his friends, who would also have had fathers and brothers already with sword in hand ready for the fight, would surely have been revenge. As a Scot he would have been more than ready to stand with his family and claim their rights in their own lands. Bear in mind that his first teachings had already installed in him the principals of liberty and the rights of the individual.</P></font>

 <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">The moment when he would strike the first blow in relation for his family's sufferings was not far off.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Dundee castle was well under the control of the English and was now owned by Brian Fitz-Alan of Bedale, he had placed the castle under the control of a constable named Selby, this man was a hardened veteran with a great thirst for blood, and in particular the blood of the Scots. Selby had a son who was just slightly older than William. On a cold December day in 1291, young Selby caught sight of William, who not only stood out from the crowd as being someone worth picking a fight with because of his size, but also because of the bright green clothes that he wore.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Young Selby, accompanied with a number of English friends pulled William aside and began to make remarks about his attire. "Thou Scot, abide; what devil clothed thee in so gay a garment? An Irish mantle were the right apparel for thy kind; a Scottish knife under thy belt to carry; rough shoes upon thy boorish feet." In saying these he was basically demanding the handsome dirk at William's belt. William's response was swift and dramatic; grabbing the Englishman by the collar, he drew his blade and thrust it through his assailant's heart.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Selby's friends made a move on William, but the crowd which was quickly gathering around the dead Selby made it too difficult for these young men to draw their swords. This gave William just the few moments that it took to strike out with his dirk, kill or wound most of the gang and make his escape.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> He ran to the house of his uncle where he was greeted by the house keeper, he told her of what had just happened and she covered him in a red cloak and sat him in the corner of the room at the spinning-wheel. Moments later when the English guards came hunting for the young William they passed his uncle's house when they realised that the only occupants were two elderly ladies weaving and spinning. The ruse worked. It was announced that afternoon that there was a warrant out for the murderer of Selby's son, if the town didn't bring forth the murderer then the whole town would be burnt to the ground and everyone within it.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> William made his way home to his mother who having already heard the news was beside herself with worry. Everyone knew that it was William that they were after as no one else could fit the description of the man they wanted.</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> William and his mother immediately left for Dunfermline, but William insisted that they return to Elerslie where they were from and her family was. After a cunning escape and quietly trudging their way to Elerslie they were met by Margaret's father Sir Ranald. Sir Ranald informed them that the news of Selby's son's death was quickly spreading, and a price had been placed on William's head and he was labeled an outlaw. Not wanting to make life difficult for himself he told them that he could look after his daughter but could do nothing for the outlaw William, his best advice was for them to split up and for William to join his uncle Sir Richard Wallace who lived in Riccarton. After some time William reached Riccarton by February 1292 and stayed there until April.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This uncle is most likely the uncle referred to in the film 'Braveheart'. Uncle 'Argyle' as he is known in the film, was portrayed as half blind, educated in languages, skillful with the sword and a general all round clever guy with a strong will. It is more likely that "uncle Argyle" is a character made up of all of the uncles that William lived with. Two uncles taught him the skills in the church and languages and the uncle he was with now after the Selby incident, Sir Richard Wallace, can be described as having been blinded, disabled and enfeebled through loss of blood in some previous skirmish he had with the English.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Everything seemed quiet and William had found a friend in his uncle's page. It is reported that one day when he was fishing on the Irvine a garrison of English soldiers rode passed. The last five soldiers, who were impressed with William's catch decided that they should have it for themselves. When William exclaimed that the catch was intended for the super of an elderly knight, the English soldiers said that they had their permission to continue fishing in order to catch more. Everything was all very peaceful and when William asked if he could at least keep half of the catch as this would be 'fair', the ring-leader of the five Englishmen became angry at being talked to so familiarly by an upstart Scot; he drew his sword and lunged for William.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> William defended the blow with his fishing-pole and struck the soldier knocking him to his feet and sent his sword flying. William rushed for the sword in order to arm himself, he detached the head of the soldier with a hard blow to the neck and turned to the other soldiers who had already dismounted and were making their way to aid their fallen comrade. William's blood was boiling; he hacked one to the collar-bone, another he struck on the arm with such force that both sword and arm fell to the ground. While the other two made off, William quickly finished off the man he had just maimed by running him through with the English sword.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On return to his uncle's house, he explained what had happened and told his uncle that he would leave his home in order to spare him the wrath of the English who would surely be soon on their way. He gathered together his possessions and William and his new page, who would also have been targeted with a price on his head, took to the woods in the north just like his father and brother had done a few years before.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Meantime, John Balliol was about to be crowned and the divide in Scotland was thickening. William was now an outlaw for, what would have been seen as, multiple cold blooded murders. He was an outlaw, a criminal and a man with a price on his head. His family were scattered to various parts of southern Scotland, his father was dead and William had no choice but to fight or die, the penalties for what he had done was death. He was only 20 years old.</P></font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  draw  a comparison again with the film 'Braveheart' and  James
Mackay's  research,   from  which  most  of  this  information  is
gathered,  we can safely point out that the movie displays  a  man
that  rose  from  a  common farmers  son  to  become  one  of  the
Guardians of Scotland within a very short period of time.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The battle of Stirling Bridge,  the sacking of York, the battle of
Falkirk and William's execution all took place over a period of  8
years.   We know that he was captured and executed in 1305,   this
would make William 33 years of age.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The victory at Stirling bridge was in 1297,  from there he invaded
England and sacked many towns and fortified castles.  1298 saw his
defeat and betrayal at Falkirk but he wasn't captured until  1305.
This  leaves  us  with two blank spaces to be filled.   The  later
being  the  7  year period between his betrayal and his  execution
,  and also the  period
between  the  incident at Irvine when he was 20 and  his  rise  to
become  the  leading force at Stirling bridge when he  would  have
been  25  years old.  What happened,  and what was William Wallace
doing during this period of 5 years before Stirling?</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  you  can  see  I have called this section "Robin  Hood?".   My
reason  for  this is because I would like to draw some comparisons
between Scotland's national hero,  and a vague figure from English
folklore who is portrayed as the English outlaw/hero.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After William had fled from his uncle's to the woods he spent  the
5  year  period I have talked about seeking revenge for  what  had
happened  to his family.  You have to remember that in these  time
in  the 13th century it was more than common place to take the law
into  your own hands,  and the seeking of revenge for even trivial
matters like the theft of a cow was punishable by whatever  method
the victim saw fit.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">If  you  know the story of Robin Hood you'll be able to understand
clearly  why  I am drawing this "resemblance".</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  As  far  as  the
English  were  concerned William was a dead  man  as  soon  as  he
showed  face.   He  had nothing to lose  at  this  point,   if  he
surrendered  he would surely have been put to  the  sword  or  the
rope.   From my impression of things he classed himself  as  'dead
already',  something which to future generations the world over is
what  makes  guerrilla  warfare   the  most  difficult  to  defend
against,   and  easily the most lethal of weapons.   It  is  quite
possible  that William Wallace could have had an attitude  of  'if
he was to go at least he could take as many as he could with him'.
From  his  dwellings in the woods he would constantly  attack  and
ambush anything with an English insignia on it,  and with quite  a
brutal  and  unforgiving anger.  He didn't do all of  this  single
handed of course.  He had previously made his way to gain the help
and  support  of  is kinsman Wallace of Auchencruive,   and  found
refuge in the Leglen Wood on the banks of the River Ayr,  this was
one  of his favourite hiding places,  and in later years the woods
was  to  be frequently visited by the bard Robert Burns who  would
go  their every Sunday afternoon to pay his respects to his fellow
Scot and someone with who he held great admiration for.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  image of William and his kinfolk rampaging around  the  woods
of  lower Scotland attacking everything English,  who by this time
were  more  than hated by every local in practically  every  town,
makes  him  appear as some kind of avenging angel crossed  with  a
serial killer with an attitude.  He did indeed attack at will  and
without  provocation  from  many  different  places  within  lower
Scotland,  and this is what gained him the reputation as  a  great
warrior  within  his own people and a feared  and  rumoured  enemy
with  the  English  garrisons.  No one ever knew  where  he  would
strike  next  or when.  Word of the giant size of  this  man  soon
spread and his skill with not only the sword and dirk but the  bow
and arrow followed quickly behind.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During  a  3 year period of ambush and gathering local support  to
his,   and their,  fight,  William would have easily gathered  the
knowledge and understanding of who his enemies were and  how  they
drew  up battle plans and tactics against his 'guerrilla' tactics,
something which had never been done before.  Until William Wallace
no  one  had ever taken on an enemy in such a way - he had  a  new
found talent for attacking and beating forces and garrisons  of  a
much larger number than his.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fighting  and hiding from within the great forests of Selkirk  one
can't  help imagine that a man of such size would not be  easy  to
hide.  It is not a fanciful idea to say that he could easily  have
disguised  himself  and  made  way  through  the  crowded  markets
crouched,  hunched and stinking of unpleasant items  in  order  to
gain  supplies and rally support.  He had done it successfully  in
the past as a youth!</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One account tells us that he could not resist the challenge of  an
English  churl  who  had  a reputation for  weight  lifting.   For
fourpence  he  would let anyone hit him across  the  back  with  a
rough pole which he carried.  William offered the man 3 times  his
usual  for the privilege,  and subsequently hit the guy with  such
force  as to break his back.  The other soldiers present tried  to
overpower  Wallace but he brained one with the  cudgel  and  broke
the  neck  of another,  then drew his sword,  felled a  third  and
slashed  through  the  armpit armour of a fourth.   Including  the
churl.   Wallace killed five Englishmen in this brief  but  bloody
encounter before leaping on a nearby horse and making  his  escape
back to his hiding place of Leglen Wood.</P></font>



<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another  account  helped William's public image  no  end.   In  an
attempt  to come to the aid of a youth being accosted  by  English
troops  he bit off a bit to much and found himself backed  up  and
overpowered.   He was pressed down,  tied  up  and  taken  to  the
Wardens prison.  At this time he was only an outlaw and not wanted
so  much  by  Longshanks  as  simply  wanted  dead  by  the  local
garrisons.  He was thrown into jail and left to die.   The  jailer
was  instructed  to feed him only with bread and  rotten  herring,
after  quite  some time,  weekend and starved he was mistaken  for
being dead when he fell into a coma.  News was spread that William
Wallace  was dead and his body was thrown onto a dung heap  to  be
left to rot.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  hearing  that  he was dead an old friend,   namely  his  first
nurse,  made her way to the jail house and asked that she take the
body  away  in order to give him a decent burial.  Of course  with
William  now dead and out of the way it seemed harmless enough  to
keep the locals happy by letting them bury him.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  took William back to her house and began to clean and prepare
him for a burial which he deserved.  However,  in cleaning him she
noticed that he still had a signs of life and she began  to  spoon
feed him,  and even her daughter,  who had a twelve week old baby,
suckled  young  William and together they both  brought  him  back
from the brink.  It is not uncommon to find certain coma cases  to
still show signs of primitive, natural reflex.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About  this  time  Sir Thomas Rymour of Ercildoune  heard  of  the
death  of  William and instantly sent a servant to find  out  what
had happened.  When the servant returned with the news that he was
alive  and  had defied death to the point where it seemed  he  had
actually returned from the grave,  Sir Thomas Rymour,  known to us
know as simply 'Thomas the Rhymer", declared:</P></font>

<font color=yellow>
For sooth, ere he decease,<BR>
Shall many thousands in the field make end.<BR>
From Scotland he shall forth the Southron send,<BR>
And Scotland thrice he shall bring to peace.<BR>
So good of hand again shall ne'er be kenned.</font><P><font color=yellow></font>


<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thomas  the  Rhymer,  had already foretold the death of  Alexander
III  and  was  widely regarded in his own lifetime as a soothsayer
and prophet.  Now that William was in good company having his name
placed  within the same mystical and supernatural circles  as  the
great  Alexander III,  not only did the English as  far  south  as
London  prick up their ears,  but also William himself  must  have
felt  that  he was something special and with a - now  foretold  -
destiny,   was there anything he couldn't do? He had stared  death
in  the face and won.  With his destiny in front of him it was not
long  before  his kinsmen and fellow Scots rallied around  him  in
support.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was  also  in these times that his taste for the  young  girls
became  a  costly  problem.  Sneaking around romancing  the  young
girls  proved to be a game that cost him many a man in battles  of
escape and also landed him in compromising positions which  almost
lead to being captured - again.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  wasn't until he met with Marion Braidfute,  the eighteen  year
old  daughter and heiress of Hugh Braidfute of Lamington that  his
heart was pierced by the arrows of love.  William and Marion never
married  as  William believed that romance and war  did  not  mix,
however,   he did see Marion as much as possible secretly  at  her
home.   It is at this point that Marion is to have given birth  to
William's daughter.  Many historians will deny that there  is  any
evidence  that William had any offspring,  and if he had  in  fact
married  her then the history books would have definitely recorded
the  event.  Marion was murdered shortly after the birth and  this
would only have spurred William into further action.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also  during  this  time he was joined  by  his  old  friends  Tom
Halliday and Edward Little who were more than pleased to see  that
William was not,  according to the rumours,  dead.  The other  old
friend  who joined the band was John Blair,  If you refer  to  the
previous  section regarding William's education,  you'll  remember
that  John  Blair was the Benedictine monk who left his  monastery
to  join  his friend William.  He spent the rest of his time  with
Wallace recording every move that they made.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So allow me to quickly recap.  We have a roving band of men making
surprise  attacks at English garrisons and troops.  William,   the
leader,  Marion his well-to-do mistress and,  by this time, around
15  fellow  Scots,  one of whom was named Little (Edward  Little),
and a to add to the similarity a Benedictine monk. Sound familiar?
It is not fanciful of me to draw this comparison.  In the story of
Robin Hood you have a giant of a man called Little John.  It would
be  easy for such a man to be a mix up between the large frame  of
William,   his  friend Edward Little and possibly  even  William's
younger brother John.  Is it possible that his younger brother was
with William,  and if he were it wouldn't take much to assume that
he would have been referred to as 'Little John' given the size  of
his older brother.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you think that I am over simplifying matters by saying that  3
people could have been fused into 1 person,  and in turn that  the
story  of  Robin Hood could actually be the English  making  their
own  version of William Wallace in order to claim their  own  hero
in  an  attempt to 'keep up with the Joneses' - then let me remind
you  that  Mel Gibson took 3 of William's uncles and  forged  them
together to create a character called "uncle Argyle" in  order  to
keep his version more compact.</P></font>
