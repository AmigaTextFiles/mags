<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>1.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> A murderer is condemned to death. He has to choose between
three rooms. The first is full of raging fires, the second is
full of assassins with loaded guns, and the third is full of
lions that haven't eaten in 3 years. Which room is safest for
him?</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>2.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him under water
for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later
they both go out together and enjoy a wonderful dinner together.
How can this be?</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>3.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> There are two plastic jugs filled with water. How could you
put all of this water into a barrel, without using the jugs or
any dividers, and still tell which water came from which jug?</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>4.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> What is black when you buy it, red when you use it, and gray
when you throw it away?</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>5.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> Can you name three consecutive days without using the words
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday?</font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=AQUA>6.</font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> This is an unusual paragraph. I'm curious how quickly you
can find out what is so unusual about it. It looks so plain you
would think nothing was wrong with it. In fact, nothing is wrong
with it! It is unusual though. Study it, and think about it,
but you still may not find anything odd. But if you work at it
a bit, you might find out.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>1.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> The third. Lions that haven't eaten in three years are dead.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>2.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her
husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>3.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> Freeze them first. Take them out of the jugs and put the ice
in the barrel. You will be able to tell which water came from
which jug.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>4.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> The answer is Charcoal.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>5.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> Sure you can: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow!</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>6.</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> The letter "e", which is the most common letter in the
English language, does not appear once in the long paragraph.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
