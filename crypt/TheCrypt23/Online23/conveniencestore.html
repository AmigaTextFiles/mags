<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Convenience  Store - the corner shop.   Everyone's  got  one,
quite  local to them,  usually on the corner of the road.   Always
there,  always open, except when you run out of milk at 2am or the
cat's  just  come in and wants feeding,  then they're closed.   We
take them for granted,  and then moan when they close down because
the  new  supermarket that opened recently that's  about  2  miles
away,  has taken all the custom,  and they can't afford to compete
and stay open.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  not  easy  to  run a little corner shop - ask  anyone  who's
tried  it,  and they'll tell you all about it.  I know,  I  manage
one.  Let me give you an example of a typical working day.   Do  I
hear you say "<I>That's boring</I>"? Not likely. Just try this for size.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  shop  opens from 7am until 10pm at night,  every day,   seven
days  a  week,  all year round.  There's no rest for the wicked  -
just  that I'd like the opportunity to be wicked once in a  while.<IMG SRC="Images/smile1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="Smillie.gif"></P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Easter  is  over - thank heaven.  I was getting tired of  counting
Easter Eggs,  and could have sold much more.  During the run-up to
Easter,   there  seemed  to be eggs everywhere,   and  the  larger
supermarkets had better deals on eggs,  undercutting  us  heavily,
and we despaired of selling any.  But,  joy of joys,  these stores
ran  out of their supplies,  and customers came hunting eggs.   By
Easter Saturday,  every last one had gone, and come Easter day, we
were  constantly being asked for eggs.  We could have sold another
100  of  them  on the Sunday alone!  There's a moral here,   don't
leave it to the last moment - buy them before the weekend.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  the displays of eggs were gone,  the shop looked bare,   so
another line had to be sourced to fill the gaps.  So, as summer is
coming,  we've stocked up on disposable barbecues,  which  in  our
shop,   will forever be known as "indoor barbecues".   Why?  Well,
last year,  these were introduced unannounced and put on a similar
display.  Horror struck within two days of displaying them,   when
one  of  our  "blonde" cashiers was overheard telling  her  mother
they  were "indoor barbecues",  very clever,  these were and would
allow  you to have a barbecue in the house!  Shocked,  we  had  to
explain  the  mechanics of these as we had visions of smoke-filled
kitchens,  and kippered families, to mention a few of the thoughts
running  through  our  heads!  She had thought  that  these  packs
contained  the food required for an "instant barbecue",   not  the
charcoal. (<I><font color=white>We hope</font></I><font color=white><font color=aqua>).</font></font></P><font color=white>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  we  are  plodding onward towards summer at a gentle  pace,   I
thought  it  would be a good time to take a holiday,  having  been
constantly  busy  throughout the autumn/winter seasons,   and  was
well  overdue  a  break,   the last break  having  been  taken  in
September.  Staff were rostered on to take over for a  week,   all
quite  willing and supportive of my decision.  I was not  planning
to  go  anywhere,  just to take life at a slower pace  and  potter
around the house and garden.  Just as well, really, seeing as last
night,  I ended up pottering around extensively in the garden - at
midnight!
</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  a  day  spent Spring cleaning the lounge,   (some  restful,
slower pace that turned out to be!),  we were both looking forward
to  a  late supper and retiring to bed,  when the phone rang.  The
call  was  from  the alarm company which monitors  our  shop,   to
inform  me  that  the  Personal Attack Alarm  had  been  triggered
inside  the  shop  and  could I check to see that  everything  was
okay?  This  is an alarm which when pressed during  a  robbery  or
personal  attack on a member of staff summons immediate assistance
from  the police.  The staff are well trained in the use  of  this
alarm,  and it is not used lightly.  The last time it was used  in
an  incident,   was  due  to  a  supervisor  being  attacked  when
challenging  a  shop-lifter.  On  checking  with  the  shop,   the
supervisor  on  duty informed me in tears that we  had  just  been
robbed of the night's takings.  Abandoning all plans,  remembering
to  turn  down  the  oven which was cooking our late  supper,   we
dashed off to the shop,  having told our lad that he couldn't come
with us, as it might be dangerous.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  arrival,   the  doors  were locked,  with  customers  standing
outside,  telling me the shop was closed.  I explained I  was  the
manager,  and they would definitely open the shop for me.  We were
duly let in and from there,  I had to gather the information  from
the staff as best I could,  remembering they were very upset,  and
shocked.  Apparently,  the thief had managed to enter  the  office
through a security door which requires a special code,  known only
to  the staff,  which is changed regularly.  How,  remains  to  be
seen,  but several theories have been put forward, which are being
investigated.  He had helped himself to money and lottery  scratch
cards  whilst  the staff were in the shop.  The  staff  heard  him
leave  through the same door he had entered,  as it squeaks,   and
they  knew  there  should have been no-one in the  office  at  the
time.  He was challenged by the staff,  who discovered the scratch
cards on him,  which were removed and as he started to leave,  was
challenged  again by the cashier,  who eventually virtually  frog-
matched him out of the shop.  Their story was upheld by the shop's
CCTV footage,  which has since been given to the police, once they
had arrived.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  had to call the police to attend,  as they had not responded to
the alarm call.  On investigation,  due to a fault developing with
the alarm system last year,  when a rodent managed to chew through
the  cable  connecting these alarms to the  system,   and  thereby
shorting  it  out,   we have discovered we  have  not  been  given
authorisation  by  the  police  to  receive  response  from  them!
Eventually  nine police cars arrived - far too late  of  course  -
leaving  them  being  only able to take statements  and  view  the
video.   The  scratch  cards were bagged up  waiting  testing  for
fingerprints (<font color=white>hopefully<font color=aqua>) and the video taken away for analysis.</font></font></P><font color=white>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  remained to comfort the staff,  one of which was a new  starter
who  we  may  never see again due to her being frightened  by  the
whole  incident,  the very tearful and shocked supervisor who  was
certain  I  was  going to sack her (<font color=white>which I'm not<font color=aqua>),   and  a  very
buoyant  young  cashier who wished she could have  another  go  at
him!  All were very upset that they had had to call me in whilst I
was  on  holiday,  and couldn't stop apologising - as  if  it  was
their fault!</font></font></P><font color=white>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sent them all home,  reset the alarms and shut the shop, looking
forward  to  returning to the now very late supper which  has  now
become  a  midnight feast,  which was still in the oven  at  home,
followed by a well-earned rest in bed. This however was not to be.
On  arriving  back  home,  we discover  that  our  lad  has  taken
precautions and locked the front door.  Fumbling for the  key,   I
find  I  haven't got mine with me,  but never mind,  he  has  his.
Great.   But it doesn't open the door!  No,  because the  lad  has
chubb locked the door from the inside.  So we knock - and knock  -
and  call and knock - with no reply.  We try phoning - we can hear
the  phone ringing in the house,  but there's no reply.  Time  for
more  drastic measures as he's obviously not hearing us.   We  can
hear  music  from inside the house - he's got the stereo  on!   No
more  tapping  on the front door and window - we try  banging  the
door  -  and then harder.  So hard that we disturb the  next  door
neighbour,  who grumbled sleepily from the window and disappeared.
Still we get no reply,  so,  assuming he's perhaps gone to bed, we
try  throwing the keys at the window.  Oops!  Bad idea -  now  the
keys  have got stuck on the upstairs window ledge.  So  we  get  a
broom  and  whack the wall with it!  Repeatedly!!  So hard,   that
eventually  the keys are dislodged from the window sill  and  fall
down.  Still no reply.  Well, not from him. The neighbours are now
well  and truly wake,  and making very loud grumbling noises!   We
resort  to phoning again,  this time to a colleague at  the  local
recovery  company to see if they can assist us with  a  ladder  to
gain  entrance  to  the  only open window,   which  is  the  lad's
bedroom.  After much hilarity,  they agree. They arrive with great
aplomb - beacons on - could see him coming down the road -  flash,
flash,  flash - no discretion here. The neighbours eventually ask,
curiosity having got the better of them and offer assistance.  Too
late,   we  inform them,  assistance has arrived.  The  ladder  is
unloaded  from the truck and set upon the lawn propped up  against
the  window sill,  and we are informed he has never been asked  to
do  this  before as he sized up the window.  This window  is  only
three  foot wide and one foot deep!  Will he fit? We have  visions
of  half  in,   half out and stuck and having  to  call  the  fire
brigade to remove him from the window.  He seems confident  enough
and anyway,  he wasn't doing anything else important.  This seemed
much more fun.  Fun? We are standing with steam coming out of  our
ears,  getting acutely embarrassed by the second,  wishing we were
anywhere  else,  and he calls it fun? He shins up the  ladder  and
tests the window for size,  looking to make sure that the  bed  he
will  land on doesn't have an occupant.  Then he starts to squeeze
himself  through  the  tiny  gap  while  we  watch  apprehensively
securing the ladder as he goes.  As we expected,  half way in,  he
has to stop.  One foot on the ladder,  one knee on the window,  up
to his waist inside the window and not going further.  Help! Then,
he's in.  He just slithered and disappeared dropping onto the bed.
No  yelps - nothing.  Then there's a shadow at the door  and  it's
unlocked - we're in!  Where's the lad? Fast asleep on the  settee,
snoring  and not more than five feet away from where we have  been
creating enough din to wake the entire population.  The stereo has
finished  playing  and otherwise there is complete  silence  apart
from the phone,  which is still ringing!  Luckily,  the meal which
had  been  left on low in the oven is fine - in fact,   it's  just
perfectly cooked.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  well  earned cuppa is started for the last hero  of  the  night
whilst we try to wake the brat.  It took some doing as he's a very
heavy  sleeper as you may have guessed by now.  He had  wanted  to
stay  up  and wait for us to return so he could find out  all  the
details, but he had to wait until the following morning for that.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wished a cheery goodnight from our rescuer,  as he set off back to
base,   having had a good laugh at our expense and  increased  his
range of skills to house breaking,  left us facing a meal  at  one
o'clock  in the morning.  Never has anything tasted so good,   and
the  prospect of a late rise in the morning as we both have a  day
off helps raise the spirits.  All we have to do now is explain  it
all to the neighbours.</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  all  in  a  day's  work - thankfully,  it's  not  often  and
hopefully,  next time won't be quite so eventful. Hope to keep you
posted on events following this incident. Take care now.</P></FONT></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><font color=white><FONT COLOR=AQUA><font color=white><FONT COLOR=AQUA><font color=white>
