<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the earliest stages of railway development, signaling as 
  such didn't exist. It was a necessity as speeds and infrastructure increased, 
  with a primitive "Ball and Chain" design being the first of many systems to 
  be employed. Various different designs of signaling were tried, some with more 
  success than others, until the more familiar upper / lower quadrant signals 
  came into being. <BR>

    These weren't the answer to all problems, however, as pointwork was still 
    a separately controlled item. Interlocking of points and signals was necessary 
    in order to gain a high degree of safety on a rapidly growing system. The 
    first employed method was a mechanical arrangement which served it's purpose 
    well, but made heavy weather of a signal-man's job due to the resistance of 
    the linkages. It wasn't until much later that the first electrically operated 
    pointwork and associated signaling was introduced, providing a convenient 
    "interlocking" without the grunt. This was a god-send to signal-men at major 
    junctions and termini, where the going could get hard.

<CENTER>The "Block" system was another safety feature,  which was based on the principle of 
"No other train to be allowed access to a block already occupied",  which naturally 
provided a safe working distance between trains.  Typically,  this would be invoked 
by Telegraphy,  which the signal-men also had to understand,  in order for the 
system to work.  In a lot of cases,  signalboxes had their floors highly polished to 
allow the signal-man to "skate" across to the telegraphy equipment with ease.
Today's equipment is now so far removed from the hands-on system,  with push-
button control,  colour light signals,  track circuitry,  and route display panels 
readily showing train positions.</CENTER></P>

<CENTER>Single line working had a simple safeguard - that of a token, which was swapped 
between loco crews either by the signal-man or the station master.  Without this 
token,  a train wasn't allowed access to the section,  as a train was already 
occupying the line.  This is still one of the safest methods of single track operation.</CENTER></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A signal-man's life is still an isolated one,  though for different reasons now.  
Whereas signal boxes were placed at regular intervals because of operating 
difficulties (heavy linkages),  they're now controlling vast stretches of track-work, 
and with it several trains at any given time. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AWS,  an advanced warning system,  had been devised and employed during the 
latter days of steam haulage on the early Diesel locos.  Primarily,  the object of this 
system was to provide an emergency brake automatically if the driver failed to 
answer the prompt,  hence bringing the train to a halt safely. </P>
