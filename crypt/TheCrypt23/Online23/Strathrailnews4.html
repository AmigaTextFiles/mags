<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Strathspey  Railway has accepted the offer  of  approximately
6,000 concrete sleepers free of charge.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  expected that they will be moved in three trainloads  from
the Jarvis Millerhill site near Edinburgh to

the  railway by EWS at a very competitive rate.  The sleepers  are
expected to be delivered in April.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While  the  railway  is a long way off rebuilding  the  line  from
Broomhill, which is expected to open in June,

to  Grantown on Spey,  its ultimate goal,  the donation of such  a
large quantity of material could not

possibly be refused.  6,000 sleepers would be enough to carry rail
2¾ of the approximately 3½ miles

towards the West Station site.  However,  even at very good  rates
for haulage the fact that the Strathspey

accepts this expenditure,  on which there no immediate return,  is
seen as further positive evidence, if

evidence  was  required,  of its commitment  to  re-establish  the
railway to the historic town.
