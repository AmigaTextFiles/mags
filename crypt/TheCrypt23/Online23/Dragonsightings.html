<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many  dragon-sighting  have  been reported  in  the    past
decade,   you will probably think these guys are just good  enough
to go in a nut house but...  in China they found a skull with horn
that  has  been mistakenly labeled as one of the rare tyrannosaur
with  horn,   also  they found a mysterious carcass  on a beach  at
Framboise,  N.S.,  in July, 1976, that appeared to be a sea-dragon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout history, water dragons have often been sighted, 
  with the most recent incidents dating back to the beginning of the twentieth 
  century.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most scientifically reliable description is that of Peter 
  Karl van Esling, the director of The Hague Zoo, who gives an account of a water 
  dragon sighted during a voyage to collect marine species in the Atlantic in 
  1860:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We saw a gigantic reptile, bright blue and silver in colour. 
  He swam gracefully around the ship before the sailors' eyes, and submerged himself 
  without a splash. His eyes were enormous, with vertical pupils and an intelligent 
  expression. They seemed luminous, but this effect could be due to the reflection 
  from the setting sun.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His head was adorned with bright blue and green crests. Even 
  though he disappeared under water and did not reappear, he appeared to measure 
  some seven meters in length, and on his back they could make out something resembling 
  a crest or fins. It was serpent-like, but the sailor thought they saw legs and 
  claw.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They baptized him Megophias.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sea-serpents seem to be a cosmopolitan breed. They share a 
  marked taste for fine weather, being rarely seen except in warm, sunny weather 
  and calm seas. They prefer to swim in warm ocean currents, spending the summer 
  months in the Northern Hemisphere and migrating in the winter to the Southern 
  Hemisphere.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A great number of sighting of sea-dragon more commonly known 
  as sea- serpent have been recorded; numbered among witnesses are such personages 
  as scientists, priest and bishops.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an article he wrote in 1817, the French-American scientist 
  Rafinesque-Schmaltz wrote of a two hundred foot long sea-serpent seen by Mrs. 
  W. Lee, in 1805, near Cape Breton and Newfoundland. She stated: <Font color=white><I>"Its 
  back was dark green and it stood in the water in flexuous hillocks and went 
  through it with impetuous noise."</I></font></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first recorded sighting in Canadian water was on July 15th, 
  1825, in Halifax Harbour. It was seen by several people from entirely separate 
  positions. They described it as having "a body as big as a tree trunk... The 
  animal had about eight coils or humps to its body and was about sixty feet long."</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A similar creature was seen the next summer by William Warburton, 
  south of Newfoundland.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">On May 15th, 1833, in Mahone Bay, forty miles west of Halifax, 
  three officers and two enlisted men of Her Majesty's Navy were relaxing on the 
  deck of a fishing boat when they sighted at a distance of one hundred and fifty 
  to two hundred yards:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">. . . the head and the neck of some denizen of the deep, precisely 
  like those of a common snake, in the act of swimming, the head so far elevated 
  and thrown forward by the curve of the neck as to enable us to see the water 
  under and beyond it. The creature rapidly passed, leaving a regular wake, from 
  the commencement of which, to the forepart, which was out of water, we judged 
  its length to be about 80 feet; and this within rather than beyond the mark 
  . . .</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is most difficult to give correctly the dimensions of any 
  object in the water. The head of the creature we set down at about six feet 
  in length, and the portion of the neck which we saw, at the same; the extreme 
  length, as before stated, at between 80 and 100 feet. The neck in thickness 
  equaled the bole of a moderate-sized tree. The head and the neck of a dark brown 
  or nearly black colour, streaked with white in irregular streaks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in the case of other Canadian monsters, sea-serpent (or 
  we will call it Sea-Dragon) sightings were often not reported until years later, 
  when, after learning of another report, previous witnesses were prompted to 
  come forward and tell their own stories. Fear of being laughed at is a very 
  strong deterrent to people speaking out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After learning of Major Langley's report, Mr. F. W. Kemp, an 
  officer of the Provincial Archives, told of his experience the year before. 
  This is his report, as given to the Victoria Daily Times:</P>
<font color=white> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On August 10, 1932, I was with my wife and son on Chatham Island 
  in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. My wife called my attention to a mysterious something 
  coming through the channel between Strong Tide Island and Chatham Island. Imagine 
  my astonishment on observing a huge creature with head out of the water traveling 
  about four miles per hour against the tide. Even at that speed a considerable 
  wash was thrown on the rocks, which gave me the impression that it was more 
  reptile than serpent to make so much displacement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The channel at this point is about 500 yard wide. Swimming 
  to the steep rocks of the Island opposite, the creature shot its head out of 
  water on the rock, and moving its head from side to side, appeared to taking 
  its bearings. Then fold after fold its body came to surface. Towards the tail 
  it appeared serrated with something moving flail-like at the extreme end. The 
  movements were like those of a crocodile. Around the head appeared a sort of 
  mane, which drifted round the body like kelp.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Thing's presence seemed to change the whole landscape, 
  which make it difficult to describe my experiences. It did not seem to belong 
  to the present scheme of things, but rather to the Long Ago when the world was 
  young. The position it held on the rock was momentary. My wife and sixteen-year-old 
  son ran to a point of land to get a clearer view. I think the sounds they made 
  disturbed the animal. The sea being very calm, it seemed to slip back into deep 
  water; there was a great commotion under the surface and it disappeared like 
  a flash.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my opinion, its speed must be terrific and it senses of 
  smell, sight and hearing developed to a very high degree. It would be terribly 
  hard to photograph, as its movements are different from anything I have ever 
  seen or heard of. I should say its length to be not less than 80 feet. There 
  were some logs on Strong Tide Island which gave me a good idea as to the size 
  of monster as it passed them. I took a measurement of one the next day which 
  was over 60 feet in length, and the creature overlapped it to a large extent 
  at each end. I put a newspaper on the spot where it rested its head and took 
  an observation from our previous point of vantage. The animal's was very much 
  larger than the double sheet of newspaper. The body must have been at least 
  5 feet thick, and was of a bluish-green color which shone in the sun like aluminum. 
  I could not determine the shape of the head, but it was much thicker than the 
  body.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not report my strange adventure except to one or two 
  trusted friends, for fear of ridicule and unbelief. About a year later, it fell 
  to Major W.H. Langley's lot to see the same or at any rate, a similar monster 
  in the vicinity also of Chatham island.</P>
<font color=aqua> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within a week of publication of the Langley report, Archie 
  Willis, the news editor of the Victoria Daily times, had "a dozen letters from 
  other people who said they had seen the serpent, but had refrained from saying 
  anything about it for fear of ridicule." One such case was that of "Rusty" Beetle 
  of Port Angeles, Vancouver Island, who had seen the animal some years before. 
  It seemed the sea-serpent appeared close to "Rusty's" boat while he was fishing 
  off Dungeness Spit in Juan de Fuca Strait. The animal was serpentine and had 
  a body at least forty feet long. The head was like that of a camel or horse 
  and there was a mane. It swam slowly round the boat for five to ten minutes. 
  When "Rusted" came ashore he excitedly related the incident to the boat's owner, 
  who replied: "Rusty, it isn't smart to take a bottle along with you when you 
  go out fishing by yourself." Disappointed that the boat owner did not believe 
  him, "Rusty" then told the story to a local journalist he knew, but the response 
  was the same. "Rusty" had then decided to keep quiet about the matter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1937 came the report of the monster seen by Mr. and Mrs. 
  Timeus, at Sunset Beach, twenty-two miles north of Vancouver. This monster turned 
  out to be a Northern Sea-elephant, one of the strangest and largest mammals 
  in the sea. A sea-serpent was seen, however, at Sunset bay later that year by 
  two brothers, acquaintances of the Timeuses, Fred and George Lawrence. The animal 
  had a head like a camel's, a small neck, and a body about the size of a large 
  barrel. It was between fifty and sixty feet long. A similar monster had been 
  seen nearly by several fishermen, who judged its length to be closer to one 
  hundred feet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that there is probably no more fascinating 
  creature in the minds of Men than the dragon. Men have been describing it since 
  the beginning of civilization. The dragons, a creature resembling to a reptile 
  with wings and a long neck, was often depicted in stories and picture in Medieval 
  times and much earlier. Throughout the second world war, there was a little 
  mention of sea-serpents - it seem everyone was to busy fighting to notice them. 
  We have to wait the late 90' to see sighting, we must admit that the great development 
  in science and technology discourage many to move forward to tell their story. 
  Dragons have been spotted in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia, 
  even if the witness was uncertain about the true size of the creature, she report 
  to have seen a giant creature about fifteen feet tall at the shoulder. After 
  telling to one of her best friend, she merely consider this as a joke.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creature was in a beautiful shade of dark green and could 
  easily blended with trees as he been standing by them but the witness report 
  that he was perched on a rocky outcropping on the side of the mountain. ...He 
  was fanning his wings slightly, looking quite calmly into the valley below. 
  I had been hiking up this mountain, when the movement of his head caught my 
  eye. I had been this way before, and there was a group of trees on the cliff 
  where there had been none before. I did not believe what I had seen at first, 
  but the shape was too obvious, and he was parallel to me, about seven bus lengths 
  away. I was climbing up one rock outface, he was on another.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. His head 
  was long, with a large eye ridge and two smaller bumps with a triceratops-like 
  horn on his nose. At the back of his head were two large horns, jutting out 
  backwards, and two smaller horns below them. They were a greyish-white and caught 
  the light like dull silver. His forelegs were slightly smaller than his hind 
  legs and were gripping the edge of the cliff. He looked as though he were a 
  quadruped. He had slightly darker dorsal ridges running from between the longest 
  horns to about halfway down his tail.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I stood there, gaping like a fish out of water, the dragon 
  turned and looked at me. He cocked his head to the side, almost like a bird, 
  then spread his enormous wings and vaulted off the cliff. He was absolutely 
  elegant in the air, flapping his wings several times before banking into a glide 
  and disappearing around the side of the mountain. My legs felt so weak that 
  I had to sit down. I have been camping in those mountains for over ten years, 
  and I have never seen anything to suggest that dragons might actually exist 
  there. But after that encounter I began to think about it. What better place 
  for a dragon to live than in the mountains? There are places in Banff and Jasper 
  that nobody has ever been to, and there are many elk and deer and possibly even 
  bears for it to feed on. Plenty of lakes, and the mountains themselves have 
  many hidden caves and the like. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A dragon perching at the very top of the mountain, especially 
  if they camouflage, could never be seen. I can't imagine my luck at actually 
  seeing one so close up and so low down in the alpine country. The place where 
  I saw him lies somewhere in the back country of Banff, beyond The Point, a fairly 
  well-known hike-in campground.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another sight was reported to be seen the February 17, 1998 
  at Niagara falls Canada. She was visiting Niagara Falls to try and relax after 
  a trying week at graduate school. ...It was about 8:00 PM and I was with my 
  Fiancee who is the only other person who saw it. I have no tangible proof- only 
  and overwhelming feeling of being protected. The next week school went much 
  better and my attitude was much better. The mist rising from the Horseshoe falls 
  was in the shape of a dragon. It was a rather large, winged blue-grey dragon 
  formed by the mist of the falls. A truly rare and beautiful sight. It seems 
  without doubt that the vast space free from civilization is prefer to dragons 
  since most recent sighting have been reported these kind of condition like in 
  Canada.</P>
