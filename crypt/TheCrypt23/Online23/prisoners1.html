        of St George slaying the dragon  stands&nbsp; what is now known throughout 
        the world as, simply, the Italian Chapel.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> It 
        is the&nbsp; only&nbsp; visible&nbsp; reminder that this was&nbsp; once the&nbsp; site of&nbsp; Camp&nbsp; 60 
      &nbsp;  the&nbsp; prisoner-of-war&nbsp; camp where hundreds of Italians were housed while 
        they worked on the nearby Churchill Barriers 
        more than 40 years ago.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> It 
        is also a remarkable example&nbsp; of how a&nbsp; faith can survive in the adversity 
        of war,&nbsp; and it stands today as a symbol of peace and reconciliation after 
        those years of conflict in World War Two.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> This 
        year marks the 60th anniversary of the arrival of the Italian POWs in 
        Orkney &nbsp; an&nbsp; event which&nbsp; is being marked by a special exhibition in 
        the Stromness Museum.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua>In 
        January 1942, 1,200 prisoners&nbsp; disembarked on the county's shores 
        to work on the construction of the Churchill Barriers, the causeways that 
        link the South Isles of South 
        Ronaldsay and Burray to the Orkney 
        Mainland.</font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> They 
        were at first defiant and hostile to their captors, while the Orcadians 
        were afraid of<BR> their&nbsp; new&nbsp; neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp; This attitude&nbsp; was soon to change, 
        and when most of them&nbsp; left<BR> Orkney in 1944 there were tears shed on both 
        sides.</font></p>

The 
        Italian Chapel on Lamb Holm was built with loving care and devotion by 
        the prisoners<BR> and has continued to be loved and cherished by the people 
        of Orkney. Some of the Italian POWs have returned to Orkney to renew old 
        friendships and to make new friends. </p></font>
      <p><font color=aqua>They 
        are no longer &nbsp; <B>"the enemy"</B>&nbsp; nor were they when they left Orkney 
        all those years ago.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> Each 
        year, thousands of visitors from throughout the world make the pilgrimage 
        to see the chapel's astonishing beauty. Few can believe it is based 
        on a basic Nissen hut enhanced<BR> only by items of apparently worthless 
        scrap.</font></p>

        man who&nbsp;must take the&nbsp; lion's&nbsp; share of the credit was an Italian prisoner 
        &nbsp;Domenico Chiocchetti, an artist and sculptor. </font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> On &nbsp;
        his arrival,&nbsp; he and his&nbsp; fellow&nbsp; prisoners&nbsp; were&nbsp; put&nbsp; ashore in small boats 
        because the steamer was too big to dock at the newly built Warebanks Pier 
        in Burray.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were taken to&nbsp; Camp 34&nbsp; on Burray, where&nbsp; they&nbsp; were all&nbsp; initially 
        held.</font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> A 
        few days later&nbsp; 500&nbsp; prisoners were taken to the small island of Lamb Holm 
        where Camp<BR> 60 was to be their new home. </font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> Orkney 
        in January could not have been more different from the climate in North 
        Africa, as Signor Chiocchetti remembered.</font></p>

      <p><font  color=aqua>The 
        little island &nbsp;(Lamb Holm) could hardly have appeared more desolate  
        bare, foggy, exposed to the wind and heavy rain. The camp consisted of 
        thirteen dark, empty huts, and mud. </font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua>Some &nbsp;
        of&nbsp; thev POWs&nbsp; were&nbsp; very defiant on their&nbsp; arrival, singing&nbsp; patriotic&nbsp; songs 
       &nbsp; and shouting&nbsp; their support&nbsp; for Mussolini:&nbsp; <B>Viva il Duce! Viva il 
        Camerati!</B> </font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> Bright 
        red target discs,&nbsp; 12 inches in diameter, were sewn onto the backs of the 
        prisoners&nbsp; jackets, with two&nbsp; smaller targets&nbsp; over&nbsp; a leg&nbsp; and arm. 
        They covered&nbsp; holes in&nbsp; the clothing, which prevented their removal.</font><font  color=aqua> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua>When 
        the POWs found that they were&nbsp; expected&nbsp; to work<BR> on building&nbsp; the barriers 
        they refused&nbsp; and went on strike. The leaders&nbsp; of the two&nbsp; camps explained 
        that they&nbsp; were being ordered to carry out works of a warlike nature 
        while their close proximity to a naval&nbsp; base put them in danger, both contrary 
        to the Geneva Convention. </font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua>Both 
        leaders&nbsp; demanded&nbsp; the&nbsp; prisoners be&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; a<BR> safe camp where no warlike 
        work&nbsp; was&nbsp; being carried out.<BR> The authorities refused, and both&nbsp; camps went 
        on&nbsp; strike. They were put on a 14 day punishment diet of bread and water, 
        with normal rations every four days.</font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua>The 
        problem was resolved when a new camp Commander, Major T. P. Buckland, 
        was appointed to Lamb Holm. He could speak Italian, and soon had the trust 
        of the prisoners. </font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> He 
        organised a meeting with the camp leaders and the Kirkwall Provost P. 
        C. Flett, who assured them&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; building&nbsp; causeways&nbsp; that&nbsp; would&nbsp; 
        link&nbsp; these&nbsp; islands&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Mainland, bringing&nbsp; great&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; to the local 
        people.&nbsp; This was&nbsp; accepted, and work resumed. The camp leaders and a few 
        others were blamed for the trouble and removed to other camps.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> The 
        sinking of the battleship HMS &nbsp;<i>Royal 
        Oak</i>&nbsp; by the&nbsp; German Submarine U-47 on October 14, 1939 with the 
        loss of&nbsp; 833&nbsp; lives prompted Winston Churchill to order the permanent closure 
        of the four channels at the east end of Scapa Flow.</font></p>

      <p><font color=aqua>Great 
        barriers that would carry the&nbsp; wartime leader's&nbsp; name&nbsp; were&nbsp; planned 
        to&nbsp; close these&nbsp; gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Balfour Beatty&nbsp; &amp; Co. Ltd&nbsp; began work in 1940, 
        building work camps,&nbsp; piers&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; uninhabited islands of&nbsp; Lamb Holm and 
        Glimps Holm, railway lines, power stations, and the erection of huge cableways, 
        called blondins, to carry the rocks and concrete blocks over 
        the seas between the islands.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> Wire 
        nets were placed inside a metal box which was then&nbsp; filled&nbsp; with&nbsp;stones. 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp; nets,&nbsp; called&nbsp; bolsters,&nbsp; were taken to the cableway and 
        hoisted over the sea and tipped out. &nbsp;&nbsp;This process&nbsp; was repeated&nbsp;&nbsp; many tens 
        of&nbsp; thousands&nbsp; of&nbsp; times until a solid wall of rock was formed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concrete 
        blocks were placed over the rock core to </font><font color=aqua>protect 
        it from the elements. The blocks were&nbsp; arranged&nbsp; pell&nbsp;-&nbsp;mell over the sides 
        to help to break up the pounding waves.</font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> The 
        routine of camp life was very much like normal army life, with Reveille 
        at 6 am in summertime and at first&nbsp; light&nbsp; in winter.&nbsp; Lights out was at 
        10 pm. An extra roll-call was sometimes held after work,&nbsp;&nbsp; just to keep 
        the prisoners on their toes,&nbsp;&nbsp; when&nbsp; British&nbsp; money&nbsp; and&nbsp; any&nbsp; weapons&nbsp; were confiscated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The prisoners were paid in camp money, tokens that could be exchanged 
        in the camp canteen.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua>The 
        prisoners used music and theatre to lift their spirits during their captivity. 
        Camp bands were formed to play popular tunes from home. Among the prisoners 
        were two artists, one was sent to each camp. Domenico Chiocchetti was 
        sent to camp 60 on Lamb Holm where he designed and painted theatrical 
        props. </font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua> An 
        operetta,&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Baker of Venice,&nbsp; was performed, complete with 
        moving gondolas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends were invited,&nbsp;&nbsp; including&nbsp; the landowner&nbsp; P. N. Sutherland &nbsp;
        Graeme&nbsp; and his family&nbsp; who lived&nbsp; at Graemeshall on the other side of&nbsp; Kirk 
        Sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; They brought with them a bunch of flowers from the garden, which 
        was used in every scene. </font></p>

      day&nbsp;&nbsp; was<BR>
      organised&nbsp; in&nbsp; Camp&nbsp; 60,&nbsp; with members from Burray's

    <p><IMG SRC="Images/Image0.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="alley.gif"><font  color=aqua>The

      complete&nbsp; with concrete balls. The cushions were made of army blankets.</font></p>
      <p><font  color=aqua> But 
        despite the sport, music and theatre that the prisoners enjoyed, many 
        wanted a church.</font></p>
      <p><font color=aqua>In 
        a&nbsp; POW&nbsp; camp life&nbsp; can be a dull daily routine not always improved by billiards, &nbsp;
        table-tennis, football or amateur theatre, all things that we POWs had 
        the strength to keep going. That wasn't enough, not for most of us 
        at least, recalled POW Bruno Volpi.</font></p>
      <p> <font  color=aqua>Nights 
        were&nbsp; our worst enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Long nights when thoughts went back home to those 
        we loved. Bad&nbsp; news&nbsp; from home,&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; somehow&nbsp;reached us, was the cause of 
        deep depression that no entertainment could ease. Only thinking of something 
        more nobler, more elevated, could we find inner peace and hope. So the 
        tiny chapel came gradually into existence.</font></p>
