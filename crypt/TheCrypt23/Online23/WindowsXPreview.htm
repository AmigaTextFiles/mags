<blockquote><p><FONT color=#00ffff> Despite the amount of mud that's slung at Microsoft these 
  days, there can't be many folk who honestly think the PC is really worse off 
  as a result of the company's efforts. In the early days PCs were awkward to 
  use and new hardware was very difficult to get working and the lack of common 
  standards often meant that getting information from one computer to another 
  was a nightmare.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00ffff>Like it or not, the fact is we don't have to mess around 
with drivers just to get a simple program running, or create a script of 
instructions to get online is largely thanks to Windows. I have to admit that 
some early versions of Windows were a pain in the rear to use and an unexpected 
system crash at best lost all your unsaved work.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00ffff>Things have changed now with the recent release of 
Windows XP, the most stable of all Microsoft's operating systems. I have been 
using Windows XP for nearly six months now with out one single crash or system 
lockup. So what's so special about XP? Well in reality Windows XP is a Windows 
NT chassis with a Windows ME body. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00ffff>So what does Windows XP look and feel like? Lets run it 
  and see. Firstly we are presented with the Logon Screen. As you can see I have 
  set up Windows XP with four user accounts, one for each member of the family 
  and each protected by its own password.</FONT></blockquote>

independently of the others using different colour schemes, backdrops and fonts. 
You may even chose from several built in ready to use themes.</FONT></P></blockquote>
