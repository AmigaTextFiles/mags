<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>What do you see, nurses, what do you see?</CENTER>
<CENTER>What are you thinking when you're looking at me?</CENTER>
<CENTER>A crabby old woman, not very wise,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Uncertain of habit, with faraway eyes?</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Who dribbles her food and makes no reply</CENTER>
<CENTER>When you say in a loud voice, "I do wish you'd try!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who seems not to notice the things that you do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And forever is losing a stocking or shoe.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Who, resisting or not, lets you do as you will,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With bathing and feeding, the long day to fill.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Is that what you're thinking?  Is that what you see?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then open your eyes, nurse; you're not looking at me.</CENTER></FONT>

<BR>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>I'll tell you who I am as I sit here so still,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As I do your bidding, as I eat at your will.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'm a small child of ten with a father and mother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Brothers and sisters, who love one another.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>A young girl of sixteen with wings on her feet,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Dreaming that soon now a lover she'll meet.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A bride soon at twenty -- my heart gives a leap,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Remembering the vows that I promised to keep.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>At twenty-five now, I have young of my own</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who need me to guide; and a secure happy home.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A woman of thirty, my young now growing fast,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Bound to each other with ties that should last.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>At forty, my young sons have grown and are gone,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But my man's beside me to see I don't mourn.</CENTER>
<CENTER>At fifty, once more babies play 'round my knee,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Again we know children, my loved one and me.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Dark days are upon me, my husband is dead;</CENTER>
<CENTER>I look at the future, I shudder with dread.</CENTER>
<CENTER>For my young are all rearing young of their own,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I think of the years and the love that I've known.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>I'm now an old woman, and nature is cruel;</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Tis jest to make old age look like a fool.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The body, it crumbles, grace and vigor depart,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There is now a stone where I once had a heart.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>But inside this old carcass a young girl still dwells,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And now and again my battered heart swells.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I remember the joys, I remember the pain,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I'm loving and living life over again.</CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>Think of the years...all too few, gone too fast,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And accept the stark fact that nothing can last.</CENTER>
<CENTER>So open your eyes, nurses, open and see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Not a crabby old woman.  Look close...see <font color=white><B>ME!!</B></font></CENTER>
