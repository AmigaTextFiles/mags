<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a thirty three year old Engineer from Grantham England. 
  I work for a large, privatized power generation and distribution company here 
  in the UK. I work as a Non Destructive Testing (NDT) Engineer and spend most 
  of my time project managing large power station overhauls. I am married with 
  three kids Amy who is 6 and Liam who is 5 and Calum who is 2. I am also a frantic 
  Football fan, and have supported Leeds United from the age of three. I am also 
  completing an Open University Masters degree in Engineering, during my spare 
  time. The rest of my time is spent researching the ancient history of my family 
  name which can be found at my other web site Tiernan.org. This is just a bit 
  of the history that I have collected on the last year or so, and I am hoping 
  to put more information up as I get some time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My  main  interests include Amiga Computers and I  regularly  Beta
test new software products including OS releases.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  am  currently  Beta testing several computer software  products
including  Amiga OS 3.9 and I am a registered developer  for  QSSL
and  their  new  Real  Time Operating System.   I  have  developed
several  scientific programs for use in research  and  development
at  work.   One day I might even release them as free-ware  but  I
doubt anyone would want them <IMG SRC="Images/smile14.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="35" ALT="smile.gif"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other  areas of interest include reading fantasy stories.  My  all
time  favourites include the Brilliant <font color=silver>" Wheel of time" <font color=aqua>series  by
Robert Jordan and the greatest book of all time <font color=silver>"The Lord  of  the
Rings"<font color=aqua>.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=silver><font color=aqua><font color=silver><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  you  can see I am using an Amiga computer.  I have been  using
Amiga's  since around 1987 and although both my wife  and  I  each
have a PC. I am not a fan of IBM Clones.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I also have a second Amiga A4000 that I keep for emergencies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  computer still requires some additions like a SCSI Scanner and
a  couple  of 9 Gig Ultra wide SCSI drives for spooling video  and
audio.   I am currently using this computer for the production  of
Broadcast  quality short videos for use in  pub  Quizzes  and  the
like.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Amiga is still the only computer that can meet my needs,  for
a  fully  pre-emptive  multi-tasking   environment.   I  hate  the
horrible bloat-ware that comes with a Microsoft Operating  System.
Size  alone,   doesn't  make an operating  system  good.   I  want
performance  and I mean real time performance complete  with  full
multi-tasking.   I want to be able to have multiple  screens  open
and to be able to flick between multiple programs at the touch  of
a  mouse button.  I need to have several programs running critical
code simultaneously. And yes this can be done easily on an Amiga
computer.</P>
