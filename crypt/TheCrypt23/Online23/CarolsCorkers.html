<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An elderly couple is vacationing in the West.  Sam always wanted a
pair of authentic cowboy boots.  Seeing some on sale one day,   he
buys them,  wears them home,  walking proudly. He walks into their
hotel room and says to his wife,</P>

<font color=green><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Notice anything different, Helen?"</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Helen looks him over,<font color=yellow> "Nope."</font></P><font color=yellow>

anything different about me?"</font></P><font color=green>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Helen looks again,<font color=yellow> "Nope."</font></P><font color=yellow>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frustrated, Sam storms off into the bathroom, undresses, and walks
back into the room completely naked except for his boots.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Again, he asks, a little louder this time,</P>

<font color=green><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Notice anything DIFFERENT?"</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Helen  looks  up and says, <font color=yellow> "Sam,  what's different? It's  hanging
down today,  it was hanging down yesterday,  it'll be hanging down
again tomorrow."</font></P><font color=yellow>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furious,   Sam  yells ,<font color=green>  "AND DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S  HANGING  DOWN,
HELEN?  IT'S HANGING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY  NEW  BOOTS!"</font></P><font color=green>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  only  friction in their marriage was the husband's  habit  of
farting loudly every morning when he woke.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  noise would wake his wife and the smell would make  her  eyes
water and make her gasp for air.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every  morning she would plead with him to stop ripping  them  off
because it was making her sick.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She  told him to see a doctor;  she was concerned that one day  he
would blow his guts out.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The years went by and he continued to rip them out!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey  for
dinner  and he was upstairs sound asleep,  she looked at the  bowl
where she had put the turkey innards and neck,  gizzard, liver and
all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  She took
the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep  and
gently  pulling  back the bedcovers she pulled  back  the  elastic
waistband of his shorts and emptied the bowl of turkey  guts  into
his shorts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some  time  later  she  heard her husband  waken  with  his  usual
trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream  and  the
sound of frantic footsteps as he raced to the bathroom.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the  floor
laughing,  tears in her eyes.  After all the years of torture  she
reckoned she had got her own back.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About  twenty minutes later,  her husband came downstairs  in  his
blood stained shorts with a look of horror on his face.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She bit her lip as she asked what was the matter.<P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He said<font color=green>"Honey,  you were right. All those years you warned me and
I didn't listen to you".</font></P><font color=green>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color=yellow>"What do you mean," <font color=aqua>asked his wife. </font></font></P><font color=yellow><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY><font color=green>"Well, you always told me that
one  day  I would end up farting my guts out and today it  finally
happened.></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But by the grace of God,  some Vaseline and these two fingers,   I
think I got most of them back in."</P>

<font color=white>DEC 20th <BR>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  starting  to snow.  The first of the season  and  the  first
we've  seen for years the wife and I took out our hot toddies  and
sat  on  the  porch watching the fluffy soft flakes  drift  gently
down  clinging  to  the trees and covering the  ground.   It's  so
beautiful and peaceful.</P>
 
<font color=white>DEC 24th <BR>
<font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We awoke to a lovely blanket of crystal white glistening snow 
  covering as far as the eye could see. What a fantastic sight, every tree and 
  bush covered with a beautiful white mantle. I shoveled snow for the first time 
  ever and loved it. I did both our driveway and the pavement. Later that day 
  a snowplough came along and accidentally covered up our driveway with compacted 
  snow from the street. The driver smiled and waved.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I waved back and shoveled it away again. The children next 
  door built a snowman with coal for eyes and a carrot for a nose, and had a snowball 
  fight, a couple just missed me and hit the car so I threw a couple back and 
  joined in their fun.</P>
 
<font color=white>DEC 26th <BR>
<font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It snowed an additional 5 inches last night and the temperature 
  dropped to around minus 8 degrees. Several branches on our trees and bushes 
  snapped due to the weight of the snow. I shoveled our driveway again. Shortly 
  afterwards the snowplough came by and did his trick again.Much of the snow is 
  now a brownish - grey.</P>
 
<font color=white>JAN 1st<BR> 
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Warmed  up  enough during the day to create some slush which  soon
became ice when the temperature dropped again.  Bought snow  tyres
for  both our cars.  Fell on my a*se in the driveway.  Went  to  a
physio but nothing was broken.</P>
 
<font color=white>JAN 5th<BR> 
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still  cold.  Sold the wife's car and bought her a 4x4 to get  her
to  work.  She slid into a wall and did considerable damage to the
right wing.  Had another 8 inches of white sh*te last night.  Both
vehicles  are  covered  in salt and iced  up  slush  that  bastard
snowplough came by twice today. Where's that bl*ody shovel.</P>
 
<font color=white>JAN 9th<BR> 
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More f*****g snow.  Not a tree or bush on our property that hasn't
been damaged.  Power was off most of the night. Tried to keep from
freezing to death with candles and a paraffin heater which  tipped
over  and  nearly torched the house.  I managed to put the  flames
out  but suffered 2nd Degree burns on my hands.  Lost all  my  eye
brows  and  eyelashes.  Car hit a f******g  deer  on  the  way  to
casualty and was written off.</P>
 
<font color=white>JAN 13th <BR>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">F****** b******d white sh*te just keeps on coming down.   Have  to
put  on  every article of clothing just to go to the post box  the
little c***s next door ambushed me with snowballs on the way  back
-  I'll  shove that carrot so far up the little pr*cks a*se  it'll
take  a  good  surgeon hours to find it.   If  I  ever  catch  the
a*sehole that drives the snowplough I'll chew open his  chest  and
rip  out  his  heart  with my teeth.  I think the  b******d  hides
around  the corner and waits for me to finish shovelling and  then
he  accelerates down the street like Michael "f*****g"  Schumacher
and buries the f******g driveway again.</P>
 
<font color=white>JAN 17th <BR>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16  more  s*dding  inches  of f*****g snow  and  f*****g  ice  and
f*****g  sleet  and  god knows what other white  sh*te  fell  last
night.   I  am  in  court  in  3 months time  for  assaulting  the
snowplough driver with an ice-pick.  Can' t move my f*****g  toes.
Haven't seen the sun for 5 weeks.  Minus 20 and more f*****g  snow
forecast</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you're hospitalized,  it pays to be nice to your nurse,  even
when you're feeling miserable.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  bossy  businessman  learned the hard  way  after  ordering  his
nurses  around as if they were his employees.  But the head  nurse
stood up to him.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One  morning she entered his room and announced,  <font color=yellow>"I have to  take
your temperature."</font></P><font color=yellow>
 
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">After  complaining for several minutes,  he finally settled  down,
crossed his arms and opened his mouth.</P>

use an oral thermometer."</font></font></font></P><font color=yellow><font color=aqua><font color=yellow>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">This  started  another round of complaining,   but  eventually  he
rolled over and bared his bottom.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After  feeling  the nurse insert the thermometer,   he  heard  her
announce,</P>

 <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">"I have to get something.  Now you stay just like that until I get
back!"</P>
 
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  left the door to his room open on her way out,  and he cursed
under  his  breath  as  he  heard people  walking  past  his  door
laughing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After almost an hour, the man's doctor came into the room.</P>

<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">"What's going on here?" <font color=aqua>asked the doctor.</font></P><font color=aqua>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Angrily,  the man answered, <font color=lime> "What's the matter,  Doc? Haven't you

while  they  were  walking past the hospital swimming  pool,   Jim
suddenly  jumped into the deep end.  He sunk  to  the  bottom  and
stayed there. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Mary promptly jumped in to save him.  She  swam  to
the  bottom and pulled Jim out.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  When the medical director  became
aware  of  Mary's heroic act,  he immediately ordered  her  to  be
discharged  from  the hospital,  as he now considered  her  to  be
mentally  stable  When he went to tell  Mary  the  news  he  said,</P>

<font color=silver><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Mary,   I have good news and bad news.  The good news  is  you're
being  discharged because since you were able to jump in and  save
the life of another patient, I think you've regained your senses.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  bad news is,  Jim,  the patient you saved,  hung himself with
his bathrobe belt in the bathroom.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">  I am so sorry, but he's dead."</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  small  Kentucky  Wild  Animal Park had  acquired  a  very  rare
species of gorilla.  Within a few weeks, the female gorilla became
very hostel and difficult to handle.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Upon  examination,  the park veterinarian determined the  problem.
The gorilla was in heat.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To make matters worse,  there were no male gorillas of the species
available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While  reflecting  on  their  problem,   the  park  administrators
noticed  Rickey,   a  part time redneck intern,   responsible  for
cleaning the animals' cages.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rickey,  like most rednecks, had little sense, but possessed ample
ability  to  satisfy  a  female of ANY  species.   So,   the  park
administrators thought they might have a solution.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rickey  was  approached with a proposition.  Would be  willing  to
have  sex  with the gorilla for $500? Rickey showed some interest,
but said he would have to think the matter over carefully.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  following day,  Rickey announced that he would  accept  their
offer, but only under three conditions.</P>
<font color=lime>
"First,"  he said,  "I don't want to have to kiss her. <BR>
  Secondly, you must never tell anyone about this."<P>
<font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  park  administration quickly agreed to these conditions,   so
they asked what was his third condition.</P>

<font color=lime><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well," <font color=aqua>said Rickey, <font color=lime> "You gotta give me another week to  come  up
with the $500.</font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=lime>
