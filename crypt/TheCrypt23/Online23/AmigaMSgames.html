<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga  Inc.  announces the Amiga® Anywhere Entertainment  Pack  #1
for  Pocket PC,  Pocket PC 2002,  Windows CE 3.0,  and Windows  CE
.NET-based devices.</P></font>

<font color=white><CENTER>Rich multi-media applications designed for handheld systems to  be

<blockquote>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">April 10,  2002 Snoqualmie, WA - Amiga, Inc. announced the release
schedule  of the Amiga Anywhere Entertainment Pack #1 for  Windows
Powered Devices.  The Entertainment Pack will run on devices using
Windows CE 3.0,  Windows CE .NET,  Pocket PC,  and Pocket PC  2002
including handhelds, smart phones, web pads, and set-top boxes.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Entertainment Pack #1 will contain four applications and  the
Amiga  Anywhere Content Engine.  These include the  award  winning
Planet  Zed  and Convex games from ZeoNeo as well as  Gobbler  and
Solitaire  from Pulsar Interactive (see screenshots  below).   The
Amiga  Anywhere  Content  Engine   allows  access  to  more  Amiga
Anywhere applications available now and in the future.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Since  announcing a change from hardware to  software  Amiga  has
strived  to create and distribute content that can run on numerous
digital  devices.  Amiga is now focused on  the  vision  that  all
digital content should be available on all digital devices,"  said
Bill  McEwen,  President and CEO of Amiga Inc.  "To that end Amiga
has announced distribution of dozens of applications that can  run
on  a  wide range of different types of devices with hundreds more
currently in development".</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Amiga Anywhere Entertainment Pack #1 will provide an exciting
experience for owners of Windows Powered handheld devices  without
using  the  amount  of  resources consumed by other  applications.
Amiga  developers are creating rich content using  few  resources.
The  average size of an Amiga Anywhere application is under  300KB
and  yet  delivers a more robust experience than titles  that  are
over 2 MB in size."</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"As  mobile devices become smarter and more powerful,   users  are
asking for rich entertainment and gaming experiences," said  Scott
Horn,  director, Embedded and Appliance Platforms Group, Microsoft
Corp.   "The  combination  of the Windows  CE  operating  system's
multimedia  functionality  and Amiga's  software  solution  allows
developers  to  deliver rich applications for  a  broad  range  of
Windows Powered devices."</P></font>
