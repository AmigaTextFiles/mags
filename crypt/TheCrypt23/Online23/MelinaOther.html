<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, in fact, Nostalgia is graphical frontend which goal is to simplify the usage of many consoles emulators on Amiga.
"Why another GUI ?", would you say ...</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Simple !</I></P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Aren't you fed up with all those command lines to type in order to run an emulator ?</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't you regret all those emulators, so much that sometime you don't know which one you have to use in order to run your game ?</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Aren't you fed up with all those GUIs, more or less complete or not always very stable ?</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, WE are and that's why we created Nostalgia, the only GUI which let's you manage 11 emulators which leads to 13 emulated consoles.</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">And all this, extremely easy.</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">This is the end of the Shell or the juggling between emulators, the principle of Nostalgia is very simple, choose your game instead of having headaches asking yourself with the "why" and the "how".</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The only thing you have to do is selecting a game and ... play !</P></FONT>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <CENTER><I>What is it ?</I></CENTER></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, to be simple, let's say that SkyLight is a GUI grouping many viewers for many file formats.
In that way, it can be compared to another of our products : Nostalgia</P></FONT>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, Nostalgia is a "basical" GUI, SkyLights will be much more sophisticated and will be the first product of a new generation of GUIs : The I.G.P.I (Intelligent Graphical Polymorphic Interface).</P></FONT>





<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The SkyLights system (because this is more a complete system than just a GUI) is an open system.
It's aim is not to be some sort of monolith reserved to some selected viewers.
The interested thing about a polymorphic GUI is the fact that anyone would ba able to develop his player as he wants and then, if he wants that his player to be supported by SkyLights, he just needs to follow some rules (an API in fact) concerning SkyLights.</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, the viewers managed by SkyLights are absolutely not some sort of "plugins" working only under the SkyLights environnement.</P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">They are true players, perfectly independant from SkyLights, the only difference between these players and the others is the fact that their author would have add some features to enable the SkyLights support such as the messenging mechanism which is perfectly transparent for the user.</P></FONT>
