<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial'><font size="+4">Want Broadband?</font></span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'> <img width=281 height=224
src="Images/wantbb1.jpg" align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1026"> <span
style='font-size:18.0pt;font-family:Arial'></span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Yeah, we all do.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Unfortunately, as it stands at present, BT has over 
  two thousand exchanges that haven’t been upgraded to allow it.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>So, how do you get it?</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Well, unless you have cable services in your area, you’re 
  pretty much screwed unless there is a friendly wireless provider nearby.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>No, didn’t think so.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Wireless providers are as scarce as rocking horse shit 
  </span><span>J</span><span style='font-family:Arial'></span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Well, they are in my area!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>So, what does that leave?</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Satellite? Satellite is another broadband provider that 
  promises much, yet, so far, hasn’t really delivered. Large installation costs, 
  poor download ratios, we’ve all heard about them.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>So, back to BT…</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img width=300 height=174
src="Images/wantbb2.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>BT claims it will upgrade an exchange if enough people 
  register their interest in broadband in an area.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>So, how do we go about that?</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'>Simple!  Get everyone to register his 
  or her interest via a participating ISP or via BT’s own site. Job done!</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Now lets look at the real world equivalent………</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>To get enough people to register, you will probably 
  need to start a campaign in your area. People want broadband, make no mistake 
  about that, but they won’t go out and do it all by themselves, you need to make 
  them!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Excuses range from, “It isn’t available so I didn’t 
  register”, to “they won’t bring that here, so why bother”.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Hullo, they said GET ENOUGH INTEREST!!!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Ok, so we’ll need a campaign. First step, register as 
  a campaign group with BT. They claim to help campaigners. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>They will tell you how many lines are on your exchange, 
  for starters. At least, you’ll know what sort of numbers you’re looking for. 
  The answer usually comes as “ Your exchange has xxxxlines and xxxx business 
  lines.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Right, that’s that out of the way. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I’ve started a campaign in my area, so I’ll let you 
  see what I’ve done so far…….</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>It must be working somewhat as I’ve over two hundred 
  registrations so far </span><span>J</span><span style='font-family:Arial'></span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I started the campaign. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I now needed to get folk to register!!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>First step, let people know there is a campaign in the 
  area.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img width=298 height=420
src="Images/wantbb3.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Cue loads of posters stating there is a campaign. Place 
  posters in local shop windows. Communities are fairly relaxed about this, if 
  they know you’re trying to do something for the area. All the shops allowed 
  me to put a poster in their window.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The poster also stated where to register their interest. 
  In this case, I put the web address of the BT site and also gave the telephone 
  number for registering via BT.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img width=333 height=468
src="Images/wantbb4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Sit back and watch the numbers climb……..</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Actually, they didn’t, well not much. Only the real 
  diehards will go out and register, all on their lonesome.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Ah well, back to the drawing board..</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Right, how to attract the punters………</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>People go some places all the time.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I went to the local libraries…….</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Librarians are very helpful people who have the area’s 
  interests at heart. Don’t believe me, go talk to one, you’ll see. Not only that, 
  but your local librarian knows most folk by first name, and when they offer 
  them an “expression of interest” form, they usually at least consider it. You’ll 
  notice that the registration form has now become an “expression of interest” 
  form. BT only asks for an expression of interest.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Here is mine!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img width=410 height=575
src="Images/wantbb5.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>You’ll probably notice that I’m ahead of myself here, 
  as this is the final version of the registration form. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Now we’re starting to get somewhere. People started 
  filling in the forms, I collected them weekly and registered them.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Where else do people go? Well, in our village, we have 
  a Business Technology Center. This is one of those places where folk learn basic 
  computer skills and go on from there to learning more about spreadsheets, word 
  processors etc. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>They turned out to be very nice people as well. More 
  registration forms were now required. This was starting to take up appreciable 
  amounts of time……</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Collection days were a matter of going round the various 
  places I had persuaded to have a pile of forms available. Then it was a matter 
  of sorting them and registering them. One of the many things I have discovered 
  is that you need to spell everything out. People were writing their names, I 
  couldn’t decipher them…….</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Alter the form to put “print” on it. They also decided 
  to put down their mobile numbers, or leave it blank, as it was ex directory…….</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>They didn’t have an email address, so didn’t bother. 
  The form went through a variety of re-writes. I was amazed at the last part. 
  Seems there’s more than a few people who use the Internet, but don’t use e-mail! 
  Also the number of folk that can’t remember their own e-mail address………the mind 
  boggles.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Now, we have a trickle of folk registering and talking 
  about broadband.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Let’s move it on again.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I put together some prizes for a “free” draw.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img width=355 height=501
src="Images/wantbb6.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Cue loads more printing……</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Repeat the last couple of steps and put up the posters.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I put down a final date for the draw; this gives folk 
  an impetus to register before a certain date.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>In between this, I contacted my local councillor, my 
  local MSP and my MP. Luckily all of them thought a campaign was a great idea.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>It didn’t help the campaign much, but it did make me 
  feel less lonely…….</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>My local councillor helped with other things. She (because 
  she’s female), actually conducted the draw, and delivered the prizes. She also 
  managed to get every last phone line at the local activity center registered 
  for broadband!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Help like this is really top notch. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Now, I really needed a website for the campaign.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Step forward my mate Steve, our beloved web paster for 
  the magazine you’re reading!</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>One thing you learn very fast doing this sort of campaign 
  is that you need friends.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Steve pulled it all together for the website. He arranged 
  the buying of the domain name for the website………and wrote it. All I did was 
  try and explain what I was hoping the website would do and look like.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>You can have a gander and see how well it turned out 
  by going here <a href="http://www.bbfordoonvalley.co.uk/">http://www.bbfordoonvalley.co.uk</a></span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I also hauled in help from Ferret, our beloved editor 
  (yeah, I’m a crawler).</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Ferret did some of the graphics and gave some clip art 
  for the site.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <img border=0 width=432 height=326
src="Images/wantbb7.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>A pic or two courtesy of my trusty FinePix and the site 
  was up and running.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I got the MSP and MP to put a message of support onto 
  the Forum on the site, and the site now looked as if it was being used. Any 
  News, however small, was also put on. This helps give the site a more personal 
  feel for the folk in the area.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The registrations still weren’t climbing fast enough 
  for me.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Time to hit the mean streets and see what happened when 
  I knocked on doors.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Now knocking on doors isn’t really as bad as it sounds. 
  You meet lots of people that you haven’t seen for years; you meet people that 
  you’ve never seen before……</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>One thing you discover pretty quickly is the amount 
  of resentment that BT is building against itself.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Abusive comments against BT are the norm when you ask 
  if they want to register for broadband. </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>BT may feel they are doing well with broadband rollout, 
  but I’d love to see their Chairman come with me for a day going round houses 
  and seeing the reactions I get……</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>BT and the fact that we can’t get Channel 5 here are 
  the main topics.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Older folk seem much more resigned to their fate, and 
  generally are very amenable to filling in a form.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>They may well remember back to when BT was actually 
  owned by everyone.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>I spend quite a lot of time explaining that we probably 
  won’t ever get Channel 5 in this area, but do explain how to get it via Sky 
  </span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>And that’s where I’m up to at present. I now have helpers 
  for various parts of the campaign, less than I would like. I’d love that everyone 
  else did the work…but that’s just me.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The Campaign is now over 200 as I said earlier and we 
  are now awaiting BT reviewing my exchange and I’m pushing now to get the other 
  nearby exchange up to a level where BT has to review it as well.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>The work may not be all that arduous, but it’s hard 
  to remember that with a really nasty bitter wind and rain in your face as you 
  tramp around the doors.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>Anyway, time to go out and get some more registrations.</span></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Arial'>No doubt, I’ll keep everyone acquainted with how we 
  get on…</span></p>
