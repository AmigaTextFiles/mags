  <p><span class=GramE>Spam, the bane of our lives.</span> You download your mail 
    and wade through large amounts of people trying to sell you almost anything, 
    legal and illegal. Medicines….which I don’t need ……yet </p>
<p>You probably all get lots of these yourselves, so you’ll be able to empathise.</p>
<p>Some ISP’s filter most of it, but some still gets through. One of the biggest 
  growth softwares has been anti Spam software. Now, as you know, we try and review 
  a few things every issue……….and we like to review free software. This issue 
  is no different and one the items this time around, is an antispam program. 
</p>
<p>The program is Spamhilator, and it’s free, of course.</p>
<p> <img width=384 height=295

<p>I’ll show some of the install grabs as usual. There’s nothing to get alarmed 
  about, this is a very well made program and the install is a breeze.</p>
<p> <img width=372 height=286
src="Images/spamann02.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>You can use the default locations, unless you want to move to another partition 
  or some such.</p>
<p> <img width=372 height=286
src="Images/spamann03.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>You can see from the grab and the path that Spamhilator is under the GNU license.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=420
src="Images/spamann04.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Also, Spamhilator supports the majority of popular email clients. Some of the 
  rest prefer you use Outlook, rather than the smaller express. Since most people 
  using Express will have already used Windows update to get <span class=GramE>Express</span> 
  up to version 6, it shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p> <img width=407 height=119
src="Images/spamann05.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>I did mention that this was a well-written program and the wizard is more or 
  less fool proof.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=420
src="Images/spamann06.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>It even makes allowances for itself, just in case it’s wrong.</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=419
src="Images/spamann07.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>Obviously, I’ve removed the addresses of my accounts in this pic, but you can 
  see what it’s doing anyway.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=420
src="Images/spamann08.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>And that’s it installed. See, totally painless!!</p>
<p> <img width=455 height=391
src="Images/spamann09.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>A quick look at the license agreement…</p>
<p>You can agree to this quickly, although it is always worthwhile actually reading 
  the agreement.</p>
<p><span class=GramE>Lets</span> have a quick look at the settings of this program, 
  where it decides how and why to act the way it does.</p>
<p>As you can see it has quite a few parts to it, so I won’t go into a lot of 
  detail as most of it works well without touching any of it. </p>
<p> <img width=553 height=364
src="Images/spamann10.jpg" align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1026"> You can 
  add addresses to the blocked <span class=GramE>senders</span> part from known 
  spammers and import your address book, so it knows not to delete mail from anyone 
  you know.</p>
<p> <img width=309 height=152
src="Images/spamann11.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As seen above, it will do the import automatically………….</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=364
src="Images/spamann12.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>If you look at the website for the program  <a href="http://www.spamhilator.com/">http://www.spamhilator.com</a> 
  , you will also find plugins for the program , although everything you need 
  at first is already in the original.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=364
src="Images/spamann13.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>Tell Spamhilator how hard you want to be on Spam. There is a part where you 
  can add Spam words……I recommend vicodin and viagra as two immediate candidates. 
</p>
<p>As I said, all the default settings will work well for <span
class=GramE>everyone,</span> the settings are there principally so you can tweak 
  the effect the program has, like with the Spam words and the blocked senders 
  and friends.</p>
<p>The program will also update itself at intervals determined by you in the settings. 
  The default is every 10 days, I believe. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=364
src="Images/spamann14.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>Save your settings using the export function.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=410 height=269
src="Images/spamann15.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>Once you have finished playing about, start your mail program. Spamhilator 
  has already configured your new mail settings. This involves changing where 
  you get your mail. You will now get your mail from the “localhost2 as Spamhilator 
  steps in between the mail program and the account.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=250 height=201
src="Images/spamann16.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>Once it has filtered your mail, it passes it on to your mail program.</p>
<p>Just in case, you can now go into the “training area” and mark mail that has 
  downloaded into “Spam” and “non Spam”</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=362
src="Images/spamann17.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"> </p>
<p>This helps the program decide what to delete in future, although it won’t delete 
  it until you ok it. Again, this is in the references.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=411
src="Images/spamann18.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1041">  </p>
<p>The recycle bin is also available, again to check what the program has decided 
  is Spam and you can empty it or wait until the time has elapsed set in the preferences 
  and Spamhilator will delete it.</p>
<p>It also has a nice little graph to show how much Spam you have received.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=414 height=344
src="Images/spamann19.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1042"> </p>
<p>This should start to increase quite rapidly as it learns (from the training 
  area) what not to let through.</p>
<p>I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I must admit, it has not 
  given me any problems, hasn’t slowed the operation of getting mail down, but 
  has already started cleaning up my mailbox. </p>
  <p>This is a little gem of a program and I urge everyone to give it a try. </p>
