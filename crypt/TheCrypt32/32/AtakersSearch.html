<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your humble scribe has had a tough time sleeping lately.&nbsp;  I 
thought it might have something to do with the happiness of 
keeping pace with a tornado toddler and an almost bursting-at-
the-seems, more-than-pregnant wife.&nbsp;   Or the joy of fending back 
the weeds threatening to overrun the house and take over the 
kingdom in a bloody coup. &nbsp;  Or the excitement of renovating an old 
room with crooked walls and a slanted floor to become a perfectly 
straight, modern nursery for our Beany-Baby-to-be.&nbsp;   Or the thrill 
of somehow trying to earn a few dollars to keep my ever-so-
friendly and oh-so-understanding bank manager from gleefully 
slapping past-due stickers all over my front door.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now I learn that my lack of sleep is from taking too much and not 
giving enough.&nbsp;  So I set out to give as much as I could.</P>

I decided to start by giving advice. &nbsp; "<B>The blue would look better 
on you.</B>"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>What</B></I>&nbsp;?" my wife asked. &nbsp; "<I><B>You never comment on what I'm wearing, 
at least not voluntarily</B></I>."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>It's my new sleeping therapy</B>," I explained with excitement. &nbsp; 
"<B>Givers sleep better than takers, so I just gave you some 
advice.</B>"</P>

"<I><B>Well,&nbsp; while you're at it, is there anything else you want to 
comment on</B></I>&nbsp;?"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I saw my chance to give a compliment.&nbsp; "<B>Overall, you are really 
beautiful.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Why, thank you.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was on a roll.&nbsp;  I was really giving.&nbsp;This was my chance to give 
her my opinion.&nbsp;  "<B>Your hair is kind of ugly like that.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B><I>What</I></B>&nbsp;?!&nbsp;&nbsp; <I><B>You take that back</B></I>&nbsp;!"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>No, I can't</B>," I protested.  "<B>That would make me a taker and I 
won't be able to sleep.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Then you can just take your silly opinions and get out of here.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>No, I can't do that. I can't take ...</B>"&nbsp; My sentence was cut 
short by the hard realization that my nose and a door could not 
occupy the same space at the same time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I decided to call my mother.&nbsp; "<B>Hi mom. &nbsp; I thought I would give you 
a quick call.</B>"</P>

"<I><B>How sweet. &nbsp; You took the time to call your mother</B></I>."

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>No.  No.  I didn't take anything,</B>" I protested.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>Oh yes you did.&nbsp;  You even took my advice to call more often. &nbsp; 
And you took account of your mother's happiness. &nbsp; And you took 
... Hello?  Hello</B></I>&nbsp;?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I just could not take any more.&nbsp;  I scrambled out the door, the 
receiver still dangling from the table.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I had to take off.&nbsp;  No, that would just keep me from sleeping.&nbsp;  I 
saw my neighbor.&nbsp;  Surely I could give him a hand.</P>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Sorry.&nbsp;  Today I'm just relaxing." &nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLACK>He studied the stress etched 
upon my face.&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=NAVY> "You look like you should take a break, too."</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK><FONT COLOR=NAVY>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>No, I can't take a break.&nbsp;  Takers don't sleep well at night</B>."</P>
<FONT COLOR=NAVY>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well, at least you're taking a stand on something."  </P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>I am NOT taking a stand,</B>" I protested.&nbsp;  I was beginning to feel 
like a career protester.</P>
<FONT COLOR=NAVY>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Take it easy, fellow."</P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yikes!&nbsp;  My neighbor was making me into a champion taker. &nbsp; I 
darted back toward my house.</P>
<FONT COLOR=NAVY>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Take care,</B>" &nbsp;my neighbor called after me.</P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Noooooooooo</B>"&nbsp; I screamed with my hands over my ears.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crouched in the safety of my favorite closet, I tallied up the 
day.&nbsp;  I gave advice, a compliment and my opinion. &nbsp; I took it 
back, my silly opinions, the time, my mother's advice and account 
of my mother's happiness, off, a break, a stand, it easy and 
care.&nbsp;  <B>I gave three times and took ten times</B>.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No wonder I wasn't sleeping well at night. &nbsp; I was truly a taker.&nbsp; 
There was nothing left to do but to take a sleeping pill.&nbsp;  That 
should give me at least five hours of sleep, give or take a few.</P>
