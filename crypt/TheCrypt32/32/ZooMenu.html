<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realising his employer won't be best pleased he disposes of the fish by
feeding it to the lions, as lions will eat anything.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving on to the second job of clearing out the Chimp house, he is attacked
by the chimps who pelt him with coconuts.&nbsp; He swipes at two chimps with a
spade killing them both.&nbsp; What can he do?&nbsp; Feed them to the lions, he says to
himself, because lions eat anything.&nbsp; He hurls the corpses into the lion
enclosure.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He moves on to the last job which is to collect honey from the South
American Bees.&nbsp; As soon as he starts he is attacked by the bees.&nbsp; He grabs the
spade and smashes the bees to a pulp.&nbsp; By now he knows what to do and throws
them into the lions cage because lions eat anything.</P>
