 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since time immemorable, space has held a fascination for us all.&nbsp;  Un-reachable and 
mysterious, the planets of our solar system and beyond have fired the imaginations of peoples 
across the world, giving rise to a variety of religions and the alternative world of Science 
Fiction.&nbsp;  The possibility of studying a Titan rocket up close, for instance, was somewhat 
remote at least.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until now, that is. &nbsp; During the recent school holidays, I took the lad to The National Space 
Centre in Leicester.&nbsp;  Allow yourself a full day to do this any justice - you'll be in awe of the 
complex by the time you leave. &nbsp; Access by car is sign-posted well from the M1- junctions 21, 
21a, and 22; just follow the brown and white signs, which are quite frequent.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Centre covers all manner of space subjects:&nbsp; from the sometimes un-known heroes of 
space exploration to communications;&nbsp; and astrology to advanced technology employed in the 
various expeditions and how the once unique materials and technology have shaped our 
every day lives.&nbsp; The Space Theatre is the central display of the complex, and is unique in it's 
own right.&nbsp; Far more than a planetarium, no less than three computer-controlled projectors 
provide a multi-image scenario to a 17.7 metre hemisphere, with the potential of 16.7 million 
colours into three-dimensional images that move anywhere on the screen.&nbsp;  Sound delivery is 
through 58 speakers delivering 4000 watts;&nbsp; the sub-woofers allowing you to feel as well as 
hear the sound.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A wide range of artifacts are available, and the emphasis is most certainly "hands-on" with 
them all.&nbsp; When you think all is done, however, there is more.&nbsp; The Rocket Tower with it's 
resident Thor Able and Blue Streak rockets, and three observation decks is beyond compare:&nbsp;  
even the tower itself is constructed from space-age materials.&nbsp; Prepare yourself to be "<B>wowed</B>" 
over this first rate attraction, designed to encourage consideration about a career in space 
exploration !</P>
