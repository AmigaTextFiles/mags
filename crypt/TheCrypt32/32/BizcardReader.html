<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  most  compact  and mobile card reader available.&nbsp;   If  you're
being handed business cards right left and centre,  it's difficult
to keep track.&nbsp;  The details of a potentially vital client could be
screwed  up  and forgotten in your pocket. &nbsp; But now you  can  keep
track of all your contacts with one incredible tiny device  -  <B>The
BizCard Reader.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>BizCard Reader</B> is an amazing miniaturised scanner.&nbsp;  It  scans
business  cards in seconds,  then accurately organises  them  into
the  correct fields,  such as contact's address,  telephone number
and e-mail address.&nbsp;  You can then export data directly to your  PC
or Palm,  and synchronise it with Outlook, Excel or other programs
for easy management.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  the  <B>BizCard</B>  you can categorise,  edit,   sort  and  search
through  your  contact  list   quickly  and  easily. &nbsp;  Sort  cards
alphabetically,  by contact or company name, or contact job title.&nbsp;
You  can  view  records as a list,  or as if  looking  through  an
album. &nbsp;  There's  also a simple editing mode for altering  contact
details or deleting them from your records.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because the <B>BizCard</B> is so incredibly small,  it's ideal for taking
on  conferences or business trips.&nbsp;  It's ideal for use with a palm
device or laptop,  so you can scan card details in almost as  soon
as you get them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  can also send data directly to your printer with the <B>BizCard</B>.&nbsp;
Save  hours  that were once wasted typing up address labels!   And
don't  worry  about  cards that use fancy or unusual  fonts.&nbsp;   The
BizCard  recognises  virtually   all  fonts,   and  also  features
Background Removal technology,  which extracts pertinent text from
a colour-filled background.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>Biz Card</B> is easy to use,  convenient and portable,  and  will
save you huge amounts of time and effort.&nbsp;  Why just stuff business
cards in your wallet and end up losing them when you can use this?</P>
