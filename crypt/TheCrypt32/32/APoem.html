<CENTER>I haven't a clue what to think or to do, so I sit at the "Miggy"  instead,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But inspiration somehow evades me, I'd be just as well off in my bed!</CENTER>
<CENTER>"<B>I've got writer's block</B>" I yell, throwing a sock, which promptly sticks to the wall,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then I set a stop-watch and settle right back, as I wait for the beggar to fall.</CENTER>

<CENTER>As time passes on and I search for a clue to a subject on which I could write,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The day passes by, with my fruitless search, until it has turned into night.</CENTER>
<CENTER>With sock stuck to the wall, I contemplate all, until it's a mass in my head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But still have no clue about what I should do, so I wearily set off to bed.</CENTER>

<CENTER>At quarter past three something has awoke me, my thoughts are as clear as can be,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"<B>I'll write down a poem, a strange sort of one; and the subject matter will be me !</B>"</CENTER>
<CENTER>As out come the words in an endless stream, and appear in order of verse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I wonder at how it was so hard to do, and if writer's block gets any worse ?</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Now ideas are coming to me thick and fast; my fingers can hardly keep pace,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Coffee is required to keep mind alert as articles appear all o'er place.</CENTER>
<CENTER>At last thoughts and images kept in my head are put on a computer and all,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I sit back in triumph, and laugh as I watch-----that flaming sock fall from the wall !</CENTER>
