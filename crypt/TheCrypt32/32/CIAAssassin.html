<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few months ago, there was an opening with the CIA for an assassin.&nbsp; These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position.&nbsp;  After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day came for the final test to see which peson would get the extremely secretive job.&nbsp; The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun.&nbsp; "<B>We must know that you will follow our instructions whatever the circumstances</B>," they explained.&nbsp; "<B>Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair.  Take this gun and kill her</B>." &nbsp; The man looked horrified and said, "<I><B>You can't be serious!  I could never shoot my wife</B></I> !" &nbsp;  "<B>Well</B>," &nbsp;said the CIA man, "<B>you're definitely not the right man for this job then</B>."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So they brought the second man to the same door and handed him a gun.&nbsp; "<B>We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances</B>," they explained to the second man.&nbsp;  "<B>Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair.&nbsp;  Take this gun and kill her.</B>"&nbsp;  The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room.&nbsp; All was quiet for about 5 minutes; then the door opened.&nbsp;  The man came out of the room with tears in his eyes.&nbsp;  "<I><B>I tried to shoot her</B></I> ; <I><B>I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife.&nbsp;  I guess I'm not the right man for the job</B></I>."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>No</B>,"&nbsp;the CIA man replied,&nbsp; "<B>You don't have what it takes.&nbsp; Take your wife and go home</B>."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now they only had the woman left to test.&nbsp; They led her to the same door to the same room and handed her the same gun. &nbsp;  "<B>We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances; this is your final test.&nbsp;  Inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair.&nbsp; Take this gun and kill him</B>." The woman took the gun and opened the door.&nbsp; Before the door even closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots.&nbsp;  Then all hell broke loose in the room.&nbsp; They heard screaming, thrashing, and banging on the walls. &nbsp; This went on for several minutes; then all went quiet. </P>

The door opened slowly, and there stood the woman.&nbsp;  She wiped the sweat from her brow and said,&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLUE> "<B>You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks.&nbsp;  I had to beat the bastard to death with the chair!</B>"</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
