<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">If you are in the middle of a painting project and need to stop for the 
day, simply cover the tray, roller and brushes with a plastic bag and put into 
the freezer rather than cleaning everything.&nbsp;  Bring the covered tray out about a 
half hour before you begin painting the next day to allow it to 'defrost'.</P>

saucer on top as the water-holder.&nbsp;  These can be painted decoratively or to 
match the colors of your home. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">Make a frugal wreath; visit your local thrift store and you'll find a 
selection of used wreaths you can fix up by adding a bow and silk flowers (silk 
flowers and other wreath decorations can also be found at thrift stores!).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">To add color to your houseplants, poke a couple silk flower stems into the 
soil.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">To remove odors from anything, use straight vinegar.&nbsp;  You can spray it on 
walls, furniture (test an inconspicuous area first) or other items.&nbsp; Don't 
worry about the vinegar odor because it dissipates along with the original odor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">One easy way to help improve your diet and save money at the same time is 
to stop buying junk food! &nbsp# If it's not there, you won't eat it!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">If you'd like to save money and you eat out a lot, rather than stopping 
altogether, consider cutting back the number of times you eat out.&nbsp;  For example, 
if you eat out twice a week, eat out only once.&nbsp;  This isn't very hard to do, 
you still get to go out, and you'll save some money. &nbsp; Later on, you can cut 
back even more.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/STAR01.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif">Sometimes you can save money by grinding your own hamburger.&nbsp;  If hamburger 
is expensive, check out the chuck roast or steak prices; if they are a lot 
less (once the cheapest hamburger I could find was $1.69/lb, then I found round 
steak for .99/lb), get it instead. &nbsp; Then take it home, cut it into chunks that 
will fit in your food processor or meat grinder and make your own!&nbsp;  Another 
benefit of doing this is that you know exactly what is in your ground beef! </P>
