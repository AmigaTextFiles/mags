 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all systems that rely upon the human factor to operate, errors are 
bound to occur at one point or other:&nbsp; these could manifest themselves in a 
plethora of ways on the railways, sometimes with amusing consequences for 
staff and customers alike.&nbsp; At other times, the outcome could be quite serious. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put a few situations together, and a recipe for disaster could be made quite 
easily.&nbsp;  For an example, the forward view from a steam loco wasn't the clearest 
at the best of times.&nbsp; Add to that 470 tons of train weight, wet rails, thick fog, 
and a bay platform with a few wagons parked without a warning lamp.&nbsp;The 
resultant is evident - a failure to stop before striking the wagons and driving 
them through the station buildings, whilst still looking for a red lamp which 
indicates the end of the "road".</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not that it requires much for something to go amiss - a loco in steam could 
easily be found miles from where it was left if not parked correctly, and heavy 
freight trains could find their own way downhill if left without an engine after 
prolonged braking before vacuum braking was fitted (the reason for "catch" 
points being introduced to de-rail run-aways).&nbsp; Shunting was a most dangerous 
occupation, and great caution had to be exercised whilst in the yards of loco - 
sheds or goods depots.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maintenance is a crucial factor to the safe operation of the railway system;&nbsp; but 
even track-gangs have their moments.&nbsp; Re-packing track ballast near water 
troughs was a temptation for the Law of Sod to come into play...... with several 
gangers soaked from yards away by an express "picking-up", not to mention the 
danger of the odd falling lump of coal.&nbsp; Signalmen had their own problems too; &nbsp;
winter brought frozen points and signals, which were assisted by judicial use of 
a kettle in several instances.&nbsp; Single line working for semi-fast services bore the 
risk of black-eyes for a signalman if he held the token too close, or in the worst 
cases, a broken hand for the fireman from hitting the token exchange pole in 
error.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet despite all of this, Britain's Railways have an extremely good safety record. &nbsp;
In comparison to the roads where accidents occur every day without fail, the 
railway system still shows how it should be done!</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crossing keepers, administration staff, cleaners, station staff; they all have their  
part to play in the biggest family anyone could join, and doubtlessly have their 
own stories to tell.&nbsp; Station goods staff faced with problems like an occupied 
coffin - do we charge by the pound, or do we use the standard adult ticket?&nbsp;  
 Railway staff, however, didn't always wear a uniform - or have two legs, as 
proven recently in the local press.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Central", station cat at Leamington Station, has reached retirement through ill-
health.&nbsp; The popular Tabby has been diagnosed with arthritis, after serving 13 
years of continuous duty, having arrived at the station as a stray kitten.&nbsp; Kind 
hearted staff made a collection of £70 for her.&nbsp; In recognition of her services, 
Mike Haigh, the Central Trains deputy managing director, presented Central 
with an engraved collar, new fleece bedding, a set of dishes, and a certificate of 
service.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central is now quite at home with her surroundings, and enjoys the occasional 
train trip; once as far as Aylesbury - a round trip of 120 miles.&nbsp;  Well known to 
train guards, her return is always guaranteed.&nbsp; Staff have decided to move her 
from the mess room that she adopted in 1990 to the supervisor's office where 
she has her own chair, so she can live out her life in comfort at the station that 
became her home.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the preservation side of things, the East Lancashire Railway has recently 
opened their extension to Heywood;&nbsp; for more information, visit their website at 
<A HREF="http://www.east-lancs-rly.co.uk">www.east-lancs-rly.co.uk</A> .&nbsp; <B>Congratulations to all concerned with this project.</B></P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent hot weather has led to alternative motive power being used on rail-
tours in most areas. &nbsp; No doubt when we get some rain, steam operation will 
resume, when the risk of lineside fires diminishes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, the Great Central Railway have recently returned another Stanier 
class 5 to working order, which featured in the recent Steam Gala. <B>Again, 
congratulations to all.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And finally, for those in need of a nostalgia trip,  try taking a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.steamsounds.org.uk">www.steamsounds.org.uk</A> , or should I say, a listen.&nbsp; This is a quality site from
David Bailey for those enthusiasts that crave a little more, and could prove 
useful for modellers too !</P>
