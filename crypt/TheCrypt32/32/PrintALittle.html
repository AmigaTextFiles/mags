<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ever  need  to  print just part of a web page or e-mail?&nbsp;  You  too
huh?&nbsp; <B>read on</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First,  you need to know that this does not work with every system
out  there. &nbsp; This tip only works if both your printer  driver  and
the  software application you're using supports this little trick.&nbsp;
So, take this for what it's worth.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Here's how it usually works:</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1.</B> First, select the area you would like to print.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2. </B>Next, from the file menu, select Print...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3. </B> When the printer dialog box comes up,  look for an option  for
"<B>Selection</B>",  in a "<B>Print Range</B>" frame.&nbsp;  Again, not all printers /
software support this.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.</B> Click Print.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BTW - Please note that I was NOT able to get this little trick  to
work  with  Netscape (4.x or 6).  This may be due  to  my  printer
driver,   but  I'm  guessing that it's more likely  that  Netscape
doesn't support selective printing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Oh</B>, &nbsp;  one  more thing.&nbsp;  If you can't print a selection,   you  can
always  copy  and paste the stuff you want into a  word  processor
and print it from there.&nbsp;  Sure,  it's not nearly as much fun,  but
it's  better than printing out eight pages of junk just to  get  a
small section of text.</P>
