<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Q.</B> Does it play copy CDs. And does it play MP3 CDs?<BR>
<B> A.</B> Yes - CD-Rs OK, some CD-RWs OK, depends mainly on the media (blank discs) used - some re "invisible" to all stand-alone CD players, and only work on PCs.&nbsp; File format needs to be suitable for CD player not PC format.&nbsp; Same for MP3 discs - usually AOK.<BR>
<BR>
 <B>Q.</B> Can I use this to record cassette tapes to CD?<BR>
<B>A.</B> NO! It's a CD player, not a CD recorder.<BR>
<BR>
 <B>Q.</B> What device is used to speed up and slow down the CD?<BR>
<B> A.</B> The CD speed is changed using push buttons to increment the speed in 1% steps.<BR>
<BR>
<B> Q.</B> Does the Homemix CDJ1 play CDs with MP3-files?<BR>
<B> A.</B> No - CDJ-1 does not play MP3 discs.<BR>
<BR>
<B> Q. </B>Just like to know a bit more about the mixing effects that it allows.<BR>
 <B>A.</B> CDJ-1 mixes two CDs, allowing you to speed up or slow down CD playing speed to "beat match".&nbsp; It also has a tape player with variable speed so you can also beat match with a tape.&nbsp; It also has an FM/AM radio with presets - no, you can't speed up or slow down radio... You can also input from any line or phono (record player) input and mix with either CD, tape, or radio - the overall output going either through the built-in amp and speakers or out put to an external amplifier - you can also provide the "mix" to an external effects unit (special effects unit like a RedSound flanger, digitiser, beat counter, whatever) and then input this mixed-mix back into the CDJ-1 for replay.&nbsp; Amazing, really!<BR>
<BR>
<B> Q.</B> How do I record my mix music on to a cd?<BR>
<B> A.</B> CDJ-1 is a CD player - not a CD recorder. CDJ-1 allows you to record onto the built-in tape player/recorder, and has external stereo phono connections (called "REC") to connect to a CD recorder/burner/PC or whatever recording medium required.<BR>
<BR>
<B> Q.</B> Does the CDJ-1 have a monitor function through the headphones?<BR>
 <B>A.</B> Yes, as a "DJ" piece of kit, CDJ-1 monitors the CD being cued up in the headphones - note that it does not monitor what is being played through the loudspeakers (your ears do that...)<BR>
<BR>
 <B>Q.</B> Is it possible to link it up to higher wattage speakers if you wanted to use it for a party?<BR>
<B> A.</B> Yes, CDJ-1 has line outputs suitable for connection to external amplifiers.<BR>
