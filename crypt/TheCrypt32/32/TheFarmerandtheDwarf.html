  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Nithe horth.</B>" says the dwarf, "<B>Can I thee her eyeth?</B>"</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">So the owner picks up the dwarf to show him the horses eyes.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Nithe eyeth.</B>", says the dwarf, "<B>Can I thee her teeth?</B>"</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Again the owner picks up the dwarf to show him the horses teeth.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Nithe Teeth</B>"  says the dwarf "<B>Can I thee her eerth</B>"</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">By now the owner is getting a little fed up but again, picks up
  the dwarf to show him the horses ears.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Nithe eerth.</B>' he says '<B>Now...can I see her twot?</B>"</P>

  and shoves his head deep inside the horses vagina.&nbsp;
  He holds him There for a couple of seconds before pulling him
   out and putting him down.&nbsp; The dwarf shakes his head and says:</P>
