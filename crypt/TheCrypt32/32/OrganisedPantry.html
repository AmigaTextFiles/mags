<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One night I was making burritos for dinner.&nbsp; I went to grab refried beans out 
of the pantry and couldn't find any.&nbsp; Later, while cleaning out the pantry, I found 
some.&nbsp; If the pantry had been organized to begin with, I would have been able to find 
the refried beans and save my husband a trip to the neighborhood store, saved 
money as refried beans at the neighborhood store are not cheap and lots of 
frustration.&nbsp; Another problem with a cluttered, unorganized pantry is waste.&nbsp; I found 
spilled flour, noodles, Jello and cornmeal packages. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, in an effort to improve myself and knowing what I had done in the past 
wasn't working, I put some thought into how I could create a better system.&nbsp; Here's 
what I came up with:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Assign a Home to Each Item</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assign a home to each different type of item&nbsp;. For example, have one shelf for 
cereals, another for canned foods, another for spices and another for 
prepared boxed meals such as macaroni and cheese.&nbsp; If you have to, you can split up a 
shelf for two different foods.&nbsp; Be sure to keep multiples of foods together so 
you can see at a glance how much of something you have. </P>

<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Get Rid of Dead Space</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make sure your shelves don't have too much dead space.&nbsp; Dead space is 
unused space which is usually found above what you are storing.&nbsp; For example, 
when I was putting my canned food away on the canned food shelf, I noticed I 
couldn't stack two regular sized (about 15 oz.) cans one on top of another, 
but there was a lot of empty space above the cans (dead space).&nbsp; So I adjusted the 
shelf up a couple of inches so now I have room to stack two regular size cans 
and there is less dead space.&nbsp; This made a tremendous difference--I could now 
get all canned foods onto this shelf rather than have them scattered 
throughout the pantry.</P> 

<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Creative Containers</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Find canisters or other holders for noodles, flour, sugar, rice, popcorn or 
other food that comes in plastic or paper bags.&nbsp; I used to store the opened bag of rice 
(or other plastic or paper bagged food) right in the opened bag (closed with 
a twist-tie) which always lead to spills.&nbsp; Now I use canisters, empty coffee 
cans, glass jars, and other containers to hold these items for no mess.&nbsp; If you use 
pretty glass jars (which you can find at thrift stores), you can store 
noodles, rice, split peas or other attractive food in them and display on your counter to 
save pantry space.&nbsp; Finally, put taller items in the back.&nbsp; This makes finding things easier. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effort you put into organizing your pantry can be very rewarding. It will 
save you time, frustration and money. It is so nice to be able to open the door 
and see everything organized (or just being able to see everything without a can 
falling on your head or toes). </P>
