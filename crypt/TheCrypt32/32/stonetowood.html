<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are those funky pop-art brown circles that decorate the top of 
your kitchen counter just 10 years of coffee stains?&nbsp;  Is that 
unusual stripes a result of years of cutting vegetables?&nbsp;  If 
so, it's time to replace that old countertop and give you and 
your kitchen a lift!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many new options in countertops today (from affordable 
to "that costs more than my entire house!" expensive). &nbsp; Here it 
is an easy guide to help you find the right options for your 
kitchen (and your pocketbook!):</P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>1. Ceramic tile</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - Ceramic tile is made of clay that that is 
dried and fired in a kiln.&nbsp; It comes in a variety of wonderful 
earth tones or colorful glazes. </font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B> The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp;  If ceramic tile is installed 
correctly (emphasize correctly!), it's heatproof, scratch 
resistant, water resistant, and long-lasting.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Some glazes react to foods or 
household chemicals. &nbsp; Grout hard to ensure these substances 
will not seep between tiles.&nbsp;  Ceramic's hard surface can 
easily chip glassware (So try not to throw the good crystal!). </P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>2. Plastic Laminate</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - Plastic laminate is resin-impregnated 
paper bonded to a particleboard core.&nbsp; As you might imagine, 
plastic laminate is relatively inexpensive.&nbsp; It comes in a wide 
range of colors and textures and bought in ready-made sections 
called post-formed, making it easy for do-it-yourselfers.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Plastic laminate is durable, easy 
to clean, stain-resistant, moisture-resistant, and inexpensive.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Laminate can be easily scratched, 
scorched and chipped.&nbsp;  High-gloss laminate shows dirt and 
water spots (ugh!).&nbsp;  And the laminate backing can be seen 
at the seams.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>3. Stainless steel</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - For more durable countertops, choose 
stainless steel that's at least 18 gauge and contains at least 
8 to 10% nickel.&nbsp;  Keep in mind that matte stainless steel is 
easier to keep clean.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Stainless steel is waterproof and 
heat resistant, easy to clean and durable.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Stainless steel can easily be 
scratched and dented.&nbsp;  Stainless steel countertops can't be 
used for cutting (because it's so easily scratched!)  If you 
have a complicated countertop with holes and cut outs, it will 
raise the cost considerably. &nbsp; Using flat stainless steel 
sheeting and adding a natural wood edge will reduce costs.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>4. Wood</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - Butcher block countertops are made from strips of 
edgegrain or endgrain maple or oak that is glued together to 
make a solid surface.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Wood is beautiful, natural, 
relatively easy to install, easy on glassware and china, 
reasonably priced, and ideal for cutting surface.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Wood can easily burn, scratch and 
dent. &nbsp; Wood countertops shouldn't be used near water (Using 
them near the sink will cause them to warp).&nbsp; Polyurethane or 
permanent sealer can be used on eating areas, but don't use it 
on cutting surfaces (use an oil finish for cutting surfaces.).</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>5. Stone</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - Stone is very good if you're working with dough (or 
HAVE a lot of dough!). &nbsp; But it can be very (make that very) 
expensive.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<BR></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Stone is strong and durable, 
heatproof, water resistant, and easy to clean.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Stone can be very heavy, so you 
must have a strong base.&nbsp;  Stone needs to be custom installed 
(Choose an installer with a strong back!).&nbsp;  Oil, alcohol, and 
any acid (lemons or wine) will stain marble or damage its 
finish.&nbsp;  Granite, however, will stand up to all of these.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>6. Solid surface</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> - Solid surface countertops are made of 
polyurethane or acrylic with mineral fillers.&nbsp; The countertops 
come in sheets approximately one half inch thick.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The best thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Solid surface countertops are 
durable, water resistant, nonporous, easy to clean, bacteria 
resistant, and mold resistant.&nbsp;  Small blemishes or scratches 
can be sanded out.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The worst thing about it:</B>&nbsp; Solid surface countertops are 
easily scratched and discolored by heat.&nbsp;  They are also 
expensive (But not quite as expensive as stone). &nbsp; Like stone, 
they need firm base of support.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whichever countertop surface you choose, be sure to take into 
account your needs, your pocketbook, and the tendency of your 
family to spill, drop, burn, scratch, stain or dent the surface 
you choose.&nbsp;  Now go out there and decorate!</P>
