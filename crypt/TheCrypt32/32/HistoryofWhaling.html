<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whaling  started in the first few centuries A.D.  by the Japanese,
and between about 800 and 1000 A.D.  by the Norwegians and by  the
Basque people living on the north coast of France and Spain.&nbsp;   The
Dutch,  British and Americans started in the 17th century.&nbsp;  All of
this  early  whaling was done from small boats  using  hand-thrown
harpoons.  Most of the whalers hunted the slow and docile Northern
Right  Whale,  so named because it was the "<B>right whale</B>" to  hunt.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Europeans  wanted  the whales for their  oil  and  for  their
baleen.&nbsp;  The Japanese ate the meat,  and found uses for many other
parts  of the whale. &nbsp; Only about 300 right whales survive  in  the
North  Atlantic  and  250  in the North Pacific  Ocean,   and  the
species  is showing no signs of recovery.&nbsp;  In February 2002,   the
National  Marine  Fisheries Service refused to designate  Critical
Habitat  for  this species,  claiming that not enough  information
was  available.&nbsp;   Many  of the deaths of these  animals  occur  by
collisions  with ships,  and special methods are being  tested  to
help avoid these accidents. &nbsp; The Southern Right Whale,  a separate
species, is doing better with about 7,500 individuals.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  species  related to the Right Whale,  the Bowhead  Whale,   was
hunted  to  extinction in the Atlantic Ocean but still  exists  in
the  North Pacific.&nbsp;  The stock is still small (7,500),  but  still
hunted  every  year  (quota  of  67/year)   by  Alaskan  Eskimos. &nbs0p;
However,  at its 2002 meeting the IWC rejected the U.S. request to
continue this hunt.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  American whalers also hunted the Sperm whale (made famous  in
Herman  Melville's  classic novel  "<B>Moby  Dick</B>"),   first  in  the
Atlantic  from  bases in New England,  later in the  Pacific  from
bases  in  Hawaii.&nbsp; Sperm whales feed on giant squid  deep  in  the
ocean,   including species that have never been  seen  alive. &nbsp; The
population  estimates  released in 2002 show  only  360,000  sperm
whales in the world's oceans,  in contrast with previous estimates
suggesting 1.5-2 million.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  whalers also hunted the California Gray whale in the  lagoons
of  Baja  California,  where they go to breed,  and from 16  shore
stations along the coast of California.&nbsp;  The California Gray Whale
is a specialized baleen whale:  it sucks mud from the ocean bottom
(in the Bering and Chukchi Seas north and west of Alaska)  through
one  side  of the mouth,  and filters crustaceans called amphipods
from  the mud using short baleen plates.&nbsp; The California Gray whale
was  hunted  almost  to  extinction  in  the  late  1800's,   then
recovered,  was hunted almost to extinction again by factory ships
in the 1930's and 1940's,  and recovered again.&nbsp;  Today the species
is  up  to  pre-exploitation levels (about 26,000)  and  has  been
removed from the endangered species list.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modern  whaling began in 1868,  when the harpoon gun and explosive
harpoon  (which  explodes inside the whale)  were  invented. &nbsp;  The
harpoon guns were mounted on fast steam-driven vessels,  making it
possible to catch the faster-swimming rorquals (blue,  fin,   Sei,
and  Minke  whales). &nbsp;  The development of factory  ships  made  it
possible  for  the  whalers  to stay  at  sea  for  long  periods,
increasing  the  number of whales they could hunt.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whaling  has  been   regulated   by   the   International  Whaling
Commission  (IWC)  since 1946. &nbsp; The IWC gave  its  member  nations
quotas  on  the whales they wanted to hunt,  based on negotiations
and  guesswork.&nbsp;   The  quotas   were  always  too  high,   so  the
populations  declined rapidly. &nbsp; After the biggest  whales  (blues)
were  hunted  to the point that they were too hard to  find,   the
whalers went on to the next largest species,  the fin whale. &nbsp; Then
they  moved on to the Sei whale,  then the Minke.&nbsp;  Humpbacks  were
also taken.&nbsp;  Chart shows take by species. Humpback, blue, fin, Sei
whale  were  hunted down to a small percentage of  their  original
populations.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  IWC  is  open  to  non-whaling nations  as  well  as  whaling
nations.&nbsp;  The non-whaling nations gradually added to their numbers
on  the  Commission,  eventually turning it from a  whalers'  club
into a conservation-minded organization.&nbsp;  As a result, in 1982 the
IWC  was   able   to   adopt   a   resolution   calling   for   an
indefinite moratorium   on   commercial   whaling,   which  became
effective in 1986.&nbsp;  International Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling    Controversy swells around whaling commission meeting  -
6-29-2000  Resolutions of the 2000 Meeting  of  the  International
Whaling Commission Recovery of some populations</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IWC moratorium meant the end of most commercial whaling.&nbs0p;  As a
result,   many species seem to be recovering,  at  least  in  some
parts  of  their  range.&nbsp;  In addition to Gray  whales,   Blue  and
Humpback  whales  are  being seen in increasing  numbers  off  the
coast of Southern California: </P>
