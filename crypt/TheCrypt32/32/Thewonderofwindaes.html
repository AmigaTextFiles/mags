<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ok,&nbsp; I admit it,&nbsp; I often get "slagged off" because I still prefer
to use my old Amiga 1200 for most of my internet work.&nbsp; But hey!&nbsp; It
makes life simple, I get up in the morning, flick a switch, The
Amiga bursts into life and away I go.&nbsp; At the end of the day, re-
flick the switch to turn it off and head for bed ...<B>Easy</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presumably when Mr Gates designed Windows, he concidered everyone
to be like himself.&nbsp; I mean to start up your PC you hit the Power
button, It tells you its loading Windows, but one of the First
things you see on the screen is a "<B>Start</B>" button.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"But I thought I had Started it?"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Gates Feindish ploy) ... The Start button is there to shut
down your computer ... WHY Didn't I think of that ...Obvious
really ...Everyone in their right mind would look for a START
button to shut down Windows... Wouldn't they?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course you could (Whisper) push the power button again. TRY IT
...The next time you boot the thing you get a right rocket </P>

GOD'S Curse be upon you for not doing things in the proper way."</I></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scan disk "Blinks accusingly at you for several minutes,
before it decides you have not self destructed your computer, and
it reloads your desktop.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Almost</B> ...... Your active desktop has disappeared, instead you get
a screen accusing you of all sorts of misdoings, With a large
button gracefully allowing you to restore your active desktop.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Embarassing or what.&nbsp; The next time you venture out of your house,
you swear blind that people in the street are pointing at you.</P>

<B>THAT'S HIM ...IMPROPER SHUT DOWN</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wouldn't it be nice if there was a small "<B>Shut Down</B>" Icon on your
desktop?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well here is how you get one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  can create a shortcut on the desktop (an Icon)  that you  can
double-click  that will turn your computer off properly  and  will
save  you  some time by replacing the steps of clicking on  Start,
Shutdown or Turnoff and then OK or turnoff.</P>
