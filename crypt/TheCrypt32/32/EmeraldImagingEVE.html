<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>eVe</B>  is the next project that we will be working towards.&nbsp;  It's  a
unique &nbsp; "console  style"&nbsp;  action   RPG  with  hand  drawn  artwork
beautiful  music and addictive gameplay.&nbsp;  Work has just  began  on
this  project  and  the game is still in  Alpha  state  but  I  am
putting  it on the site so that I can keep people updated  on  the
development status.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These  are
still early and much of the gfx etc.&nbsp;  will be changed/improved  in
the full game.&nbsp;  (particularly the "in-game" shot). &nbsp; It should give
a  small idea to what is planned.&nbsp;  I have finished much of the NPC
and  "talk  window"  code. &nbsp; More work on the actual  gameplay  and
programming will be the focus for the next bit and  then  the  gfx
will be touched up and finished.&nbsp;  Most of the main characters have
been  designed now and work has begun on the story and  events  in
the  game.&nbsp;   I  will reavel some of these aspects  when  they  are
finalized... </P>
