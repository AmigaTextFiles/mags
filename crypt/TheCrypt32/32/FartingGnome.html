<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  little fella just can't hold it in.&nbsp;  He might look  like  an
innocent garden ornament,  but as soon as someone walks past  him,
he  lets  loose a pant-ripping fart that would put  a  foghorn  to
shame!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  naughty  <B>Farting Gnome</B> has a built-in motion  detector  (no,
not  that  kind  of  motion  -  wash  your  dirty  mind  out  with
carbolic.)&nbsp;  So when someone or something moves past him he  senses
the movement and promptly parps one out at top volume!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Farting  Gnome  is  ideal   for  placing  on  your  desk  and
embarrassing  the  hell  out of your colleagues,   or  giving  the
cleaning  lady a fright.&nbsp;  Plus you can blame him  for  those  post
late  night curry guffs.  `<B>It wasn't me,  it was the gnome!</B>' &nbsp; Just
don't tell anyone the gnome only makes a farting sound and  not  a
farting smell.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There's  hours  of gloriously childish fun  to  be  had  with  the
<B>Farting Gnome</B>.&nbsp;  Imagine when your mom invites the vicar round  for
tea  and  scones,  and your gnome lets rip as she brings the  tray
in.&nbsp; Just how will she explain that one to the Reverend?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gnome may differ slightly from that illustrated.</P>

Uses 2 X AA batteries, not included.<BR>
