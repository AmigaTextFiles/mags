<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales are large,  magnificent, intelligent, aquatic mammals.&nbsp; They
breathe  air  through  blowhole(s)  into lungs  (unlike  fish  who
breathe using gills).&nbsp;  Whales have sleek,  streamlined bodies that
move  easily through the water.&nbsp;  They are the only mammals,  other
than  manatees  (seacows),  that live their entire  lives  in  the
water,  and the only mammals that have adapted to life in the open
oceans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales  breathe  air. &nbsp; They are <B>NOT</B> fish. &nbsp; They are  mammals  that
spend their entire lives in the water.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Cetaceans</B>  are  the  group of mammals that  includes  the  whales,
dolphins, and porpoises.</P>

<B>Like all mammals:</B><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
Whales breathe air into lungs,<BR>
Whales have hair (although they have a lot less than land mammals, and have almost none as adults),<BR>
Whales are warm-blooded (they maintain a high body temperature),<BR>
Whales have mammary glands with which they nourish their young,<BR>
Whales have a four-chambered heart.<BR>

<B>SIZE</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  biggest whale is the blue whale,  which grows to be about  94
feet  (29  m)   long  - the height of a 9-story  building. &nbsp;  These
enormous  animals  eat  about 4  tons  of  tiny  krill  each  day,
obtained by filter feeding through baleen.&nbsp;  Adult blue whales have
no predators except man.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  smallest whale is the dwarf sperm whale which as an adult  is
only 8.5 feet (2.6 m) long.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  blue  whale  is the largest animal that has ever  existed  on
Earth.&nbsp;  It is larger than any of the dinosaurs were.&nbsp; They are also
the loudest animal on Earth.</P>


<B>TWO TYPES OF CETACEANS</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cetaceans include the whales,  dolphins and porpoises. &nbsp; There  are
over  75 species of Cetaceans.&nbsp;  Whales belong to the order Cetacea
(from the Greek word "ketos" which means whale),  which is divided
into the following groups:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Toothed  whales (Odontoceti) </B> - predators that use their  peg-like
teeth to catch fish,  squid,  and marine mammals,  swallowing them
whole.&nbsp;  They have one blowhole (nostril)  and use echolocation  to
hunt.&nbsp; There are about 66 species of toothed whales.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Baleen  whales   (Mysticeti) </B>   -   predators   that   sieve  tiny
crustaceans,  small fish,  and other tiny organisms from the water
with  baleen. &nbsp;  Baleen is a comb-like structure that  filters  the
baleen whales' food from the water.&nbsp;  Baleen whales are larger than
the toothed whales and have 2 blowholes (nostrils). &nbsp; There are  10
species of baleen whales.</P>


 <B>SWIMMING AND OTHER WATER ACTIVITIES</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales  have a streamlined shape and almost no hair as adults  (it
would  cause  drag  while swimming).&nbsp;  Killer whales  and  Shortfin
Pilot  whales are the fastest,  swimming up to 30 miles  per  hour
(48 kph).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales  swim by moving their muscular tail (flukes)  up and  down.&nbsp;
Fish swim by moving their tails left and right.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Breaching:</B> &nbsp;  Many  whales  are  very  acrobatic,   even  breaching
(jumping)  high out of the water and then slapping  the  water  as
they come back down.&nbsp;  Sometimes they twirl around while breaching.&nbsp;
Breaching  may be purely for play or may be used  to  loosen  skin
parasites or have some social meaning.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Spyhopping:</B> &nbsp; This is another cetacean activity in which the  whale
pokes its head out of the water and turns around,  perhaps to take
a look around.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/tailslap.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="71" ALT="tailslap.jpg"></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Lobtailing:</B>&nbsp;  Some whales stick their tail out of  the  water  into
the  air,   swing  it around,  and then slap  it  on  the  water's
surface;  this is called lobtailing.&nbsp;  It makes a very loud  sound.&nbsp;
The  meaning or purpose of lobtailing is unknown,  but may be done
as a warning to the rest of the pod of danger.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Logging:</B> &nbsp; Logging is when a whale lies still at the surface of the
water,   resting,   with its tail hanging  down. &nbsp;  While  floating
motionless,  part of the head, the dorsal fin or parts of the back
are exposed at the surface.</P>
<BR>
<B> MIGRATION</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many ceteaceans,  especially baleen whales, migrate over very long
distances  each year.&nbsp;  They travel,  sometimes in  groups  (pods),
from cold-water feeding grounds to warm-water breeding grounds.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gray  whales make the longest seasonal migration  of  any  of  the
whales.&nbsp; They travel about 12,500 miles each year.</P>

<BR>
<B> SOCIAL BEHAVIOR</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cetaceans have very strong social ties.&nbsp;  The strongest social ties
are between mother and calf.&nbsp;  A social group of whales is called a
pod. &nbsp;  Baleen whales travel alone or in small pods. &nbsp;  The  toothed
whales travel in large,  sometimes stable pods.&nbsp; The toothed whales
frequently hunt their prey in groups,  migrate together, and share
care of their young.</P>


 <B>WHALE SONGS</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complex whales songs can be heard for miles under the water. &nbsp;  The
humpback's song can last for 30 minutes.&nbsp;  Baleen whales sing  low-
frequency  songs;  toothed whales emit whistles  and  clicks  that
they  use  for echolocation The songs are thought to  be  used  in
attracting mates,  to keep track of offspring, and for the toothed
whales, to locate prey.</P>
