<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  time to throw away your jump leads.&nbsp;  The <B>Easy Start</B>  is  the
quickest  and  most  effective way to start  a  car  with  a  flat
battery.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  flat  battery  on a cold winter's morning can be  a  nightmare.&nbsp;
You're  desperate  to  get to work,  and what  are  your  options?&nbsp;
Almost electrocuting yourself trying to do a jump start,  or doing
battle with the public `transport' system?&nbsp; Well now there's a  new
safe,   clean and easy option that doesn't involve getting covered
in engine oil or being talked to death by grannies on the bus.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>Easy Start</B> is one of those simple but revolutionary concepts.&nbsp;
All  you have to do is connect it to your car's cigarette lighter,
then connect the other end to the cigarette lighter of a car  with
a  good  battery. &nbsp;  As little as five minutes  charging  time  can
provide enough of a boost to get you moving!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>Easy  Start</B> is incredibly,  well,  easy,  and effective  too.
There's  no messing around under the bonnet or waiting around  for
hours. &nbsp;  Even if your headlights aren't lighting up,  a 25  minute
charge is enough to get you going.&nbsp;  It's not only a quick and easy
method  of starting your car battery,  but a much safer  one  than
jump starting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  4.5  metre  cable  means  your partner/friend/  kind  neighbour
probably  won't even have to move their car to connect  their  end
of  the  <B>Easy  Start</B>  to yours. &nbsp; The up to the  minute  electronic
technology  utilised by the <B>Easy Start</B> makes  it  completely  safe
for both cars.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>Easy Start</B> is an essential accessory for any driver,   easily
stored  in  a  glove compartment or toolbox,  and  ideal  for  car
trouble  on  the move.&nbsp;  Whether it's a brass monkey  winter  or  a
temperamental old banger that's worrying you,  it gives you  peace
of mind for less than 15 quid.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suitable for all 12V car batteries.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Warning:</B>&nbsp;   Make sure to disconnect the <B>Easy-Start</B> from  both  cars
before  starting the car with the flat battery  to  avoid  blowing
the fuses of the cigarette lighters.</P>
