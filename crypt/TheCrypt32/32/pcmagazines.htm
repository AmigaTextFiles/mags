<p>While buying the shopping this month, I noticed how many PC related magazines 
  there now were.</p>
<p>Which ones to buy and read?</p>
<p>What did they have inside them?</p>
<p>The price varies quite substantially as well, ranging from £6 down to £1.</p>
<p>So, I decided to try out some of them.</p>
<p>I have a subscription to ComputerActive. This magazine was one of the first 
  PC magazines I ever tried when I first got a PC, and I have found it to be great 
  value…the sub is under £1 an issue and it is delivered to the door. It doesn’t 
  come with any cover disks or anything, but does have loads of articles aimed 
  at the beginner!!</p>
<p> <img width=292 height=395

align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1026"> This means that all the articles 
  can be clearly followed by anyone with a very small knowledge of their computers 
  and can be a Godsend to those who don’t have the time or temperament to try 
  and wrestle with their computers.</p>
<p>Right, I’ll get on and tell you about the ones I bought to try out and how 
  I got on with them. Remember, this is just a quick overview of them.</p>
<p>The first magazine I bought to trial this time around was WebActive.</p>
<p>WebActive is a sister magazine to ComputerActive and is very well priced (even 
  in the shops) at under a pound.</p>
<p>I had shied away from this magazine in the past, I use the Internet frequently, 
  what could it tell me?</p>
<p>The magazine, again similar to its sister publication isn’t all that thick 
  and the issue I bought weighed in at 82 pages, which as you’ll see later on 
  isn’t all that big in the magazine stakes.</p>
<p>Well, unsurprisingly, I got my eyes opened.</p>
<p>The magazine is written in the same style as its sister. Nice clear articles 
  and simply put.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have a cover disk, but, at this price, that’s hardly a wonder.</p>
<p>The magazine covers topics such as interesting websites, networking (something 
  that is getting bigger and bigger rapidly) and safety on the Internet. It also 
  has reviews of games and auctions…quite an extensive list.</p>
<p>I found this magazine very interesting, which surprised me, and read it from 
  cover to cover. It does have ads for all manner of companies, but I didn’t find 
  them detracting from my reading of the magazine. People who don’t want to spend 
  all day searching for a particular type of website e.g. an auction site or something 
  to do with Barbie dolls will find this an indispensable resource. Couple that 
  to learning how to build a website or use an authoring package (it has a tutorial 
  on Dreamweaver), and it builds up into a very useful magazine that doesn’t break 
  the bank. If you want to spend less time searching for interesting sites and 
  want clear concise detail on a particular part of the Internet, I would recommend 
  you pick this up. The magazine is released monthly.</p>
<p>It may not be the most reading, but everything in it I found interesting. The 
  articles themselves were a joy and had loads of information that could come 
  in handy for all those using the net.</p>
<p>Back in the days of the Amiga, I used to buy a lot of Amiga magazines; AUI, 
  Format, CUAmiga etc. and I always managed to find something of interest in them, 
  although my favourite was AUI. I loved their coverdisks!</p>
<p>Anyway, the PC has a magazine called (unsurprisingly) PCFormat. This magazine 
  isn’t particularly cheap and weighs in at just under £6. It does have a cover 
  disk; the one I bought had a CD mounted on it, although there is a DVD version 
  as well.</p>
<p> <img width=422 height=571
src="Images/magazine2.jpg" align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_i1025">   Well, remembering the Amiga version of this mag, I expected quite a lot from 
  it.</p>
<p>One thing the PC mags need to learn is the art of sticking a coverdisk to the 
  cover. CUAmiga and the rest had perfected the glue technique and it’s about 
  time the PC versions learnt from it. The ones with covermounts that I bought 
  all used sellotape, which is not an ideal way to put them on. You know what 
  I mean; you end up with either a torn cover or a mess of sellotape on the cover 
  if you’re not careful. Just a small gripe but one that irked me.</p>
<p>Anyway…………….</p>
<p>PCFormat was everything I expected it to be. PCFormat is one of the thicker 
  magazines and the issue I bought came in at 178 pages The magazine had a wide 
  variety of articles ranging from hardware to software. There were articles on 
  networking (told you it was growing rapidly), games reviews, case mods and favourite 
  websites, Loads of news and the latest reviews of a mixed bag of equipment. 
  As you’d expect from this future publication, it has in depth looks at a variety 
  of PC related aspects on the OS and how to get the best out of your software. 
  I did find that it was more orientated towards the major packages than say, 
  smaller free software, but that may well be expected considering the size of 
  the PC market and its demand for faster, more extensive software and hardware. 
  The speed junkies have always driven the PC market and maybe this is one of 
  the major reasons for the downfall of the Amiga market.</p>
<p>The coverdisks, there were two had a variety of trial software, a few complete 
  packages (same as the Amiga disks, older versions but still completely useable), 
  and game demos. This again, helps anyone that doesn’t have a fast connection. 
  Someone on a 56k modem is hardly likely to download a 300mb demo and this is 
  one of the nice aspects of the disks. The coverdisks didn’t have everything 
  on them that the DVD version did, so that in itself is an incentive to buy the 
  DVD version if you have a drive that can read them………and who doesn’t nowadays? 
  If you liked the Amiga version of this mag or you simply want an interesting 
  read that covers all aspects of the PC genre you could do a lot worse than buy 
  this mag. I’d recommend you buy the DVD version of it, though and get full advantage 
  of all the software that they have available for you. The only off-putting part 
  is the price <span>J</span> The magazine is released monthly. Having said that, 
  it will take an appreciable amount of time to read it all, although the likes 
  of case mods passed me by. A very well rounded magazine, which commend readers 
  to it, and is from a company that has specialised in computer magazines for 
  a long time.</p>
<p>The last one I trialled (I’m not made of money) was PCUtilites Plus+.</p>
<p>This, again, was a major departure for me. The magazine trumpets itself as 
  “the biggest software collection that money can buy”. It certainly has a lot 
  of software on it. The covermount on the issue I bought was a DVD. I think that 
  what the plus bit was all about…</p>
<p> <img width=420 height=568
src="Images/magazine3.jpg"
align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1027"> Yes, 4.5 gb of utilities!!</p>
<p>Now, as you all probably aware, I am a sucker for software of all descriptions 
  and this is what attracted me to this particular magazine. I thought that this 
  was one of the monthly magazines, but this turns out not to be the case. It 
  may be quarterly and reading the initial blurb gives no clue to its frequency. 
  I’ll dwell on the DVD, since this is what the magazine is entirely about.</p>
<p>As you can see from the cover, there is an awesome collection of software on 
  the disk</p>
<p>The software doesn’t have any professional packages given away, as is the case 
  with PCFormat, but does have loads of free packages, if you see what I mean.</p>
<p>Putting the DVD in the drive starts the disk browser.</p>
<p> <img width=480 height=324
src="Images/magazine4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026">  </p>
<p>You first get the obligatory disclaimer, and then onto the software.</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=373
src="Images/magazine5.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>The browser is nicely laid out, although I’d have preferred it was grouped 
  better. You can get the same programs listed in more than one grouping, although 
  this seems to be how they have decided to describe the packages. </p>
<p>The browser, as you can see brings up listings of all the packages, saving 
  you trawling through all the directories via Dopus (everybody has installed 
  Dopus, haven’t they?). Just as an aside, I can’t understand anyone, especially 
  if they ever owned an Amiga, who hasn’t installed Directory Opus! since it was 
  given away on one of the PC magazine covermounts, there really was no reason 
  not to have it.</p>
<p>Back to the DVD, the browser gives basic information on all the programs. It 
  gives the size of the program and a quick install button. This is a boon as 
  well and there is even a search on the browser to help you even more. I did 
  a search for Office to try it out…</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=373
src="Images/magazine6.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>So, how good is the disk?</p>
<p>Well, that all depends on how addicted to software you are, and how interested 
  in freeware and shareware packages. For instance, I loved this disk, it saved 
  me lots of time, searching the Internet and downloading……….. For you, it may 
  be a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>If you enjoy trialling software, this is the bee’s knees, if not, forgets it. 
  This magazine caters for a very specialised part of the PC market. It does have 
  a few small games on it as well, but, in general, unless you want to see what 
  everyone else thinks is worthwhile writing a program about, it might not be 
  your cup of tea.</p>
<p>The magazine is at the £6 mark alongside the rest of the market, and inside 
  the covers of it, you get a few descriptions of some of the more major pieces 
  of software. The rest of the magazine gives a complete listing of the DVD, detailing 
  all the software by filename on the disk, windows OS required and a one line 
  description of the software as well as the size of the file and its type e.g. 
  free, shareware, limited trial etc.</p>
<p>The number of pages in this issue was 98, so that in itself reveals how many 
  programs are on the DVD. You could do worse than buy this every issue, if you 
  download non-commercial software.  </p>
