<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Welcome to issue 32 of the<FONT COLOR=RED> CRYPT<FONT COLOR=SILVER> magazine.&nbsp; Another bumper issue of
fun and frolics for you all to enjoy.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firstly&nbsp; I would like to extend my thanks to all those that passed
comments on our last issue, either by personal mail or through the
various groups forums.&nbsp; Your comments were/are greatly appreciated
by myself and all team members, and they  provide the encouragement 
 for us to continue with the publication of the<FONT COLOR=RED> CRYPT<FONT COLOR=SILVER>.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well the rumour mill has been in full swing again, regarding the Amiga
parent Company.&nbsp; "<B>Supposedly</B>" they have $100 in the bank and debts
of $2 million ... <B>Wail</B> ...<B>Groan </B>...<B>Gnashing of teeth</B>,&nbsp; The Amiga is
dead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How often have we heard "<B>The Amiga is Dead</B>" but it always seems to
"<B>rise from the ashes</B>" and live on to fight another day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So just how dead is the Amiga?&nbsp; Well check out this Issue, We have
one print magazine in production, and word has been released that
those nice guys at Amiga Org are bringing out a second print mag.&nbsp;
Well we are not exactly starved of reading material then.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Ah</B> ... But what about New software?&nbsp; you ask.&nbsp; Well again,&nbsp; check out
this issue, A brand new Amiga game just started, and the
possibility of another new game being ported from MorphOS to
Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Admittedly it not ground breaking stuff, One game in production
and one possibility, But we are still going.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Hardware:&nbsp; Spoiled for choice, You can get the new AmigaOne
board from Eyetech, unfortunately you will have to run it using
Linux until next year when OS 4 <U>should</U> be available.&nbsp; Or
you could buy the Alternative Amiga ... Pegasos and
run MorphOS.&nbsp; The screenshots look fantastic and new software is
being actively developed for it.&nbsp; (An added bonus is you can still
run some older Amiga Software).&nbsp; The choice is yours, You don't
<B>HAVE</B> to buy a PC, But if you do, We still have some of the best
Amiga emulators around.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does that sound like a dead computer platform to you?&nbsp; As long as
people continue to use and enjoy their computer, <B>It will live on</B>.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of you may think the Theme page of this issue<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> 
    "The last of the Leviathans"<FONT COLOR=SILVER> a strange selection. However 
    the Whale is a truly glorious creature that graces our oceans, and must be 
    protected for the benefit of our children.&nbsp; Whales are from the same 
    family as mankind (Mammals), Air breathing Animals giving birth to live young.</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales have no natural predators apart from Man, Yet we have 
    hunted them to near extinction, and continue to do so, to this present day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The largest creature ever to live on this planet, is the Blue
whale, at 80 to 90 feet long, and weighing between 120 to 150
tons.&nbsp; Yet only 10000 to 14000 of these creatures exist today.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten to fourteen thousand may sound a lot, but consider this :- that
figure would be the population of only an average village, and the
fact that this planet is cover two thirds by water means that the
whales are spread over vast distances.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try to imagine what it would be like if only 10000 humans populated
the world today!&nbsp; <B>A frightening thought.</B></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly most humans will live their life and never see one of 
    these fascinating creatures.&nbsp; It would be impossible to have such a creature 
    in captivity, like Tigers or Elephants in a Zoo.&nbsp; The only way to preserve 
    the Whale is to stop hunting and killing them, and hope that their numbers 
    increase.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The human race must take responsibility for its past crimes
against nature and that time is <B>NOW</B>&nbsp; before we wipe out the entire
population.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Rant over<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> :)</font></B><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>. We hope you enjoy this current issue of the Magazine, and hope to hear your comment on this issue.&nbsp; See you all soon in,</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
