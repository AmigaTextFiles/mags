<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jack was to be married to Jill, so his father sat him down for a fireside
chat.&nbsp; "Jack," he says, "Let me tell you something.&nbsp; On my wedding night in
our honeymoon suite, I took off my trousers, handed them to your mother and
said ' Here Darling, try these on'.&nbsp; So she did, and said 'Well sweetie,
they're a little too big, I can't wear them' So I replied "<B>Exactly - I wear
the trousers in this family, and I always will</B>'.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ever since that night we have never had any problems."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Hmmm," &nbsp;says Jack, and thinks it's a good thing to try.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, on his honeymoon
Jack takes off his trousers and says to Jill, "Here Baby, try these on".&nbsp; So
she does and says, "These are too large, they don't fit me".</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jack then says,
"Exactly. I wear the trousers in this relationship, I always will, and I
don't want you to forget that".</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this, Jill takes off her knickers, hands
them to Jack and says,&nbsp; " Here, you try on mine". </P>
