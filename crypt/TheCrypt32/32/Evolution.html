<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales  and dolphins have had an on-again,  off-again relationship
with  the sea.&nbsp;  Life evolved in the sea some 3 billion years  ago.&nbsp;
When  opportunities  for food opened up on  land,   some  animals,
including  the  dolphins  and   whales,   moved  onshore  to  take
advantage  of  the  food supply. &nbsp; These ancestors  were  distantly
related  to  cows and horses and have been described as  wolf-like
in appearance.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some reason,  probably again to find food, the
descendants of these animals worked their way back into  the  sea,
probably  first  foraging from shore before becoming  full-fledged
ocean dwellers.&nbsp;  As new fossils are uncovered,  scientists believe
they  may  find further evidence that the ancestors of whales  and
dolphins moved on and off the land several times.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  fossilized  jawbone  and   teeth   recently  unearthed  in  the
Himalayan  foothills suggest whales originated about 53.5  million
years  ago.&nbsp;  This find is 3.5 million years older than any fossils
previously  found. &nbsp;  The  fossil is  a  new  whale  species  named
<B>Himalayecetus subathuensis.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scientists  agree  that dolphins and whales  descended  from  land
animals  that  were ungulates (like horses,  cows,   hippos,   and
camels). &nbsp;  Now  some   researchers   are   finding  some  striking
similarities  between  hippos,  which spend  much  of  their  time
partially  submerged in muddy pools,  and dolphins,   which  spend
most  of  their lives submerged in the ocean.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both may  give  off
underwater sounds through fatty areas in their heads. &nbsp; The dolphin
transmits  sounds through a fatty area on its  forehead  known  as
the  melon.&nbsp; Scientists thinks hippos,  although  they  do  have
vocal  cords,   may also release sounds into the water  through  a
roll of fat in their throats.&nbsp;  Both may "<B>hear</B>" through their jaws.&nbsp;
The University of California at Santa Cruz examined
dolphin skulls to find evidence that sounds are conducted  through
the  lower  jaw  to  the  dolphin's ears. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They al0so  found  similar
structures  in  hippos that may make it  possible  for
hippos  to  listen  to sounds above the surface  with  their  ears
while  simultaneously  monitoring underwater  sounds  through  its
submerged  jaw. &nbsp; They have a close blood match. &nbsp; Jerold Lowenstein
of  the  University  of California at San Francisco  has  compared
blood  serum  of  whales with many ungulates,   including  cattle,
pigs,  and gazelles.&nbsp;  He found whales were more similar to  hippos
than  to  any other group (although DNA studies have not confirmed
this).</P>
