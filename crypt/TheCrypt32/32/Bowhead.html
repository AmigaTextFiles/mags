<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bowhead whale is an Arctic baleen  whale,
a  right whale with a large,  bow-shaped head that is up to 40% of
its body length.&nbsp;  The arched mouth is up to 10 feet (3 m) wide and
20  feet (6 m)  deep. &nbsp; The eyes are very small and lips are  huge.&nbsp;
Bowheads live in pods,  are rich in blubber (a subcutaneous  layer
20-inch (50 cm) thick in places), and have 2 blowholes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales grow to be about 50-60 feet (15-18.5 m)  long,
weighing  over  80-110  tons  (72-91  tonnes). &nbsp;  The  females  are
slightly larger than males, as with all baleen whales.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bowhead whale's skin is usually  black
with  a  white spot on the lower snout.&nbsp;  Calves are blue  to  gray
colored.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowheads  have  no  dorsal fin and no throat grooves. &nbsp;  They  have
short, narrow flippers; the flukes are 27 feet (8.1 m) wide.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales (like all  baleen  whales)   are
seasonal  feeders  and carnivores that filter  feed  plankton  and
tiny crustaceans like krill,  copepods,  pteropods, etc., from the
water. &nbsp;  Bowheads are skimmers,  filter feeders that  swim  slowly
with their mouth open,  constantly eating.&nbsp;  On occasion,  they are
also  bottom  feeders,  eating benthic prey from the  mud  on  the
ocean floor. &nbsp; The fine baleen hairs can filter out very tiny  prey
including  copepods,   steropods,    euphasids  and  mysids  (tiny
crustaceans).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  bowhead whale has about 350 pairs of black baleen plates with
silver-colored bristles hanging from the jaws. &nbsp; The baleen is  the
longest of any whale and very fine;  baleen plates are about 175.5
inches (4.5 m) long and 14 inches (36 cm) wide</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead  whales   are  not  extremely  social  and
congregate in small pods of about 3 whales in the spring and  pods
of about 50 whales in the fall.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead  whales can dive for almost an  hour,   but  dives
usually  last 4-15 minutes. &nbsp; They can go to a depth  of  500  feet
(155 m).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales breathe air at the surface  of
the  water through 2 blowholes located near the top of  the  head.&nbsp;
They spout (breathe)  about 1-2 times per minute at rest,  and 4-6
times per minutes to prepare for a dive.&nbsp; Their blow is bushy  and
rises in two cloudy masses 20 feet (6 m)  above the surface of the
water.&nbsp;  Bowheads can break through surface ice (less than  1  foot
or 0.3 m thick)  in order to breathe.&nbsp; They may use echolocation to
determine the thickness of the ice.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales normally swim (cruising or migrating)  at 2-7
mph,   but  can go up to 10-12 mph (16-19.5 kph)  in short  bursts
when in danger.&nbsp; Feeding speeds are slower, about 1.2-2.5 mph (1.9-
3.2 kph).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales vocalize when on migrations,   mostly
between  the frequencies of 50-300 Hertz. &nbsp; The songs may  be  used
for  locating  large masses of krill (tiny crustaceans  that  they
eat) and for communicating with other whales.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead  whales live exclusively in  the  Arctic  at  the
surface of the ocean.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales stay in arctic waters,  making a northern
migration  in  the  spring to rich feeding waters.&nbsp;   They  migrate
south  again  in  the  fall to breed and calve.&nbsp;  Migrating  speeds
range from 2-7 mph (3.2-11 kph).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bowhead gestation period is about  12-16  months
and  the  calf  is born tail first (this is normal for  cetaceans)
and  near  the surface.&nbsp;  The newborn instinctively  swims  to  the
surface  within 10 seconds for its first breath;  it is helped  by
its  mother,  using her flippers.&nbsp;  Within 30 minutes of its  birth
the  baby whale can swim. &nbsp; The newborn calf is about 17 feet  long
and weighs about 5-6 tons (4.5-5.4 tonnes). &nbsp; Twins are rare; there
is  usually one calf. &nbsp; The baby is nurtured with its mother's milk
and  is  weaned  in about 1 year.&nbsp;  The mother and  calf  may  stay
together for a year or longer.&nbsp;  Bowhead whales reach puberty at  6
years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bowhead whales have a life expectancy of at  least  40
years, but perhaps longer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is estimated that there  are  about  8,000-
12,000  bowhead   whales   world-wide. &nbsp;   Bowhead  whales  are  an
endangered species.</P>
