<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Isn't  funny  how work gets to you. &nbsp; Working in retailing  I  have
always worked on a Saturday,  it's almost a sacred day,  mind  you
since  the advent of open all hours policy this mantra has  become
somewhat diluted. &nbsp; Normally we have Mondays off which if  we  were
truthful we would not swap for a Saturday. &nbsp; So where is  all  this
nonsense  leading to?&nbsp; Well I wish to tell the  world  that  I  had
Saturday 16th August off, because I worked the previous Monday, so
there!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  what  did  I do to make the most of my sacred time,   well  at
least  after I had taken Margaret to work! &nbsp; Get the caravan  ready
for the holiday. &nbsp; New Gaz bottle,  wash the caravan, get it out of
the garden and onto the road.&nbsp;  Well surely I had to get it out  of
the  garden  before  I  could actually go on holiday.&nbsp;   Absolutely
right  but not easy to achieve.&nbsp;  We live on an estate of 35 houses
which  are grouped around three cul-de-sacs. &nbsp; We are on  a  corner
with  access  to our garage and Garden at the back of  the  house.&nbsp;
Pat our previous neighbour,  who lived on her own and kept her car
on  her  drive,  and was a lady of a certain age decided that  she
would much prefer to go and live back in Wales.&nbsp;  <B>I did not mention
Anne Robinson! </B>&nbsp; She was replaced by an older couple with two  sons
in their mid thirties,  is there no hope! &nbsp; Obviously they have  to
park  their  vehicles somewhere but this has turned a  quite  easy
exercise into a difficult one.&nbsp;  Why?&nbsp; Well they don't  seem  to  be
overly  approachable and I have this uneasy feeling  I  might  not
get  the  response I would expect if I asked them  to  move  their
cars .&nbsp;  So when we go away on holiday or just for the weekend this
is  a worry in the back of our minds.&nbsp;  Anyway an opportunity arose
so  I  took it.&nbsp;  No cars,  so my car moved and the caravan quickly
connected to the car, the parking place was won!!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simon  picked  Margaret up from work just after 1.00pm  and  after
some lunch we were heading down the M1 by 2.30pm.&nbsp;  Traffic <B>OK</B>  but
from  time  to  time it seemed to grind to a halt but  fortunately
only briefly. &nbsp; Same thing on the M25 but nothing serious.&nbsp; Is it my
imagination but do caravans feel more stable when they  have  more
in them?&nbsp; Just over 3 hours,  including a comfort break, from MK to
Black Horse Farm near Folkestone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  little  bit  of  de-ja-vu as this is the  site  from  which  we
started  our  ten  week trip last year.&nbsp;  I was  intrigued  by  the
notice  outside the office when we arrived. &nbsp; There was  a  message
for  <B>Mr  Blair</B>.  You know,  I had no idea he was a member  of  the
Caravan Club!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up  bright  and early on Sunday morning in order to  catch  8.15am
ferry. &nbsp; The Docks are only a 20 minute drive from Black Horse Farm
and  in  fact we got there in time to be whisked onto the  earlier
ferry.&nbsp;  You imagine that all ferries in mid August would  be  full
to  the  gunwales  but  the <B>Pride of Canterbury</B>  was  comfortable.&nbsp;
Perhaps  it was lack of school parties and day trippers that  made
the difference.&nbsp;  I was also surprised at some of the offers in the
'<B>Duty  Free</B>' 3 boxes of wine for the price of two and one offer  I
really like but was frowned on that I should take part in was  buy
two  bottles of Courvoisier and get the second one at half  price,
perhaps on the way back!</P>
