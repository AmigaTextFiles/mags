<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Why?"</B> gasped Duncan.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I><B>"Daddy says that crabs are too common"</B></I>&nbsp; she wailed.&nbsp; <I><B>"He claims you are a mere
crab and a poor one at that, and that crabs are the lowest class of
crustacean and that no daughter of his will marry someone that can only walk
sideways"</B></I>&nbsp; Duncan was shattered, and scuttled away into the darkness to drink
himself into a filthy state of aquatic oblivion.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night, the Great Lobster Ball was taking place.&nbsp; Lobsters came from far
and wide, dancing and merry making but the Lobster Princess refused to join
in, choosing instead to sit by her father's side, inconsolable.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly the door burst open, and Duncan the crab strode in.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lobsters all stopped their dancing, the Princess gasped and the King
rose from his throne.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Slowly, painstakingly, Duncan the crab made his way across the floor.......
and all could see that he was walking, not sideways..... but forwards... Yes
<B>FORWARDS</B>, one claw after another!!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step by step he made his approach towards the throne until he finally looked
King lobster in the eye.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was a deadly hush..........................</P>
