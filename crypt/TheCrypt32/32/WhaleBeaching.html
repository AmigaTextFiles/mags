<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several  hypotheses  have   been   put   forth  to  explain  these
strandings which likely have multiple causes. &nbsp; The whales  may  be
sick  or  hurt;  illness or parasites may affect  their  sense  of
direction. &nbsp;  It  is believed that whales use magnetic  fields  and
underwater topography to orient themselves. &nbsp; For this  reason,   a
magnetic  field  deviation  or an odd  coastline  formation  could
cause  confusion. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not an uncommon occurrence  for  beached
whales that have been returned to deeper water to later strand  on
the same beach from which they were freed. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their reference points
may  wrongly lead them to believe that deeper water  lies  in  the
direction of the beach.&nbsp;  Live strandings often repeatedly occur in
the  same  area,  in zones with specific characteristics.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pelagic
species of whales that are more at home in deep,  mid-ocean waters
may  get  caught  off  guard  by   the  falling  tide  in  shallow
estuaries. &nbsp; In the case of mass stranding,  whales may  simply  be
following a confused leader,  or they may be swimming to  the  aid
of  an already stranded whale that is sending off a distress call.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Essentially, these strandings remain somewhat mysterious.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  live  beached  whale may die of disease or  injury.  &nbsp; In  these
cases,  the disease or injury may also be the cause of the whale's
stranding. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the whale is neither sick nor hurt, but is not able
to  get  back  into deep enough water,  with the rising  tide  for
example,  it will generally die of complications related to  being
out of water.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At sea,  water supports the whale's body.&nbsp;  On land,
air  does not offer this support.&nbsp;  The whale's body weighs it down
and  it  may  "<B>suffocate</B>" under its own weight; &nbsp;  its  respiratory
muscles  are incapable of sufficiently dilating its  rib  cage  to
ensure  adequate pulmonary ventilation.&nbsp;  Also,  on the portion  of
the  animal's  body  that is in contact with  the  ground,   blood
circulation is blocked by the animal's weight,  causing tissues to
die. &nbsp;  Even  if the animal is returned to the water,   these  dead
tissues will produce toxins leading to generalized infection.</P>
