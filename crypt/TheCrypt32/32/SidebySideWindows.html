My monitor offers high resolution (1,600-by-1,200)  to show easily
the  full width of two Microsoft Word pages side by side.&nbsp; I often
find  this  useful for writing in one Word window while  referring
to  text  in  the  other.&nbsp;  But Word 2002's Window &nbsp;   <B>Arrange  All</B>
&nbsp;command  insists on arranging the windows one on top of the  other
instead of side by side,  forcing me to waste time setting up  the
windows manually by clicking and dragging.&nbsp;  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So how do I get this to happen automatically?&nbsp; Well
Word can't perform this function,  but Windows can.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simply right-click on
any  blank area on the Windows taskbar and you'll see a menu  that
includes  the  choice  <B>Tile  Windows Vertically</B>,   which  actually
places the windows side by side in horizontal format.&nbsp;  If all  you
have  open  are  two  Word Windows,  you'll get  the  side-by-side
arrangement you want.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you have more than two documents open,  you can still get  the
side-by-side  arrangement by minimizing the other  windows  before
performing the commands.&nbsp;  To undo the side-by-side display, right-
click  the  taskbar again and choose Undo Tile or  rearrange  each
window as needed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Note:</B>&nbsp;  that  because you're using a Windows command rather  than  a
Word command,  you can create a side-by-side display with any  two
windows,  letting,  say,  a Word window and an Excel window  share
the screen. Even works with DOpus on the PC.</P>
