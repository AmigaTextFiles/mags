<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the world's easiest to use,  most versatile hands-free
kit  for  your mobile.&nbsp;  Like most hands-free systems,  it  can  be
powered  through a car cigarette lighter.&nbsp;  But unlike most  hands-
free systems,  it's got a built-in rechargeable Li-ion battery, so
when  they  say `Anywhere',  they really do mean you  can  use  it
anywhere!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <B>Plug `n' Go</B> doesn't need any complicated installation.&nbsp;  Simply
use the suction cup to attach it to a smooth surface,  such  as  a
car  windscreen,  computer monitor or desk. &nbsp; You  can  adjust  the
flexible arm according to your needs,  allowing you to  have  your
phone  at  eye  level. &nbsp;  Then you can  chat  or  charge  whenever,
wherever.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  well  as being more convenient,  the <B>Plug `n' Go</B> has  superior
sound quality to most hands-free systems. &nbsp; Because the speaker  is
at  the  back  of  the  unit,   the sound  is  reflected  off  the
windscreen when the unit is used in the car.&nbsp;  This provides better
amplification for clearer conversations.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  <B>Plug  `n' Go</B> also has extra features to make it versatile  as
well  as useful. &nbsp; For instance,  if you're travelling with someone
but  still  want  a private phone conversation,  an  earpiece  and
microphone  are  provided. &nbsp; Also,  if there's  no  smooth  surface
available  to  attach  the suction cup to,  the  adhesive  suction
holder disc allows you to attach it wherever you like.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No  complicated installation,  easily moved or removed,   easy  to
use,  versatile and with high quality sound.  What more could  you
ask for from a hands-free system?</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Unit measures: 11.5 x 5.5cm</P>
