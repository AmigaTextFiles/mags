<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Download images, MP3s, MPEGs and more to your desktop in seconds with the small and stylish 6 in 1 Card Reader.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 6 in 1 Card Reader is an easy to use and incredible effective data transfer gadget, ideal for use with digital cameras or MP3 players.&nbsp; Directly connecting a device to a PC or Mac USB port for downloading can significantly reduce its battery life, and is also time-consuming.&nbsp; Transferring files to the 6 in 1 Card Reader is much quicker and kinder on your batteries.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can transfer data at the incredible rate of 600 - 900KB per second with this incredible wallet-sized gizmo.&nbsp; And as its name suggests, this is no one-trick, or one-format, pony.&nbsp; The 6 in 1 Reader supports all the major digital media card formats.&nbsp; If you're a hi-tech gadget addict, there's no need to buy a separate device for all the various memory cards available - this has a slot for the lot.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the 6 in 1 Reader you can both read files from or write files to Secure Digital (SD) Cards, Compact Flash Cards, Smart Media Cards, Multi Media Cards, IBM Micro Drives and Memory Sticks.&nbsp; Both PC and Mac compatible, it comes with a CD-ROM for easy installations, and with certain Windows and Mac software* you don't even need that - the system detects it automatically!</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The size and weight of the sleek looking 6 in 1 Reader make it perfect for use with laptops, for transferring files between work and personal PCs, or sharing photos with family and friends quickly and easily.&nbsp; Best of all, it comes at a price to blow your mind!</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">`The only flash card reader card worth considering.&nbsp; The price and features just beat the competition into a pulp' - Mac Format magazine</P>
