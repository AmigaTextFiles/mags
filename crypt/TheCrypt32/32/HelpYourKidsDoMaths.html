<B>Uh oh.</B><BR>
Your kids arrive home with their school reports and it's
poor marks from the math department.&nbsp;  Now what do you do?<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may not be a math teacher, but thankfully there are ways
you can help your kids improve their grades.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Studies have shown that children are much more likely to
perform well in a subject that interests them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So here are 5 ways to get your kids excited about math and
actually looking forward to the next math class:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1. Inspire them.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some kids don't enjoy math because they just can't see the
point of it. &nbsp; Unlike reading or painting, all those
mathematical symbols and numbers don't seem to mean
anything.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What you need to do is show them how important math is in
the real world.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tell them stories about the great engineering feats
throughout history.&nbsp;  From building the great pyramids of
Egypt, to the Hoover dam, to the latest space missions to
Mars, nothing would have been achieved without mathematics,
and mathematicians.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2. Get practical.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Involve your kids in some real world math away from the
classroom.&nbsp;  Find something your child is interested in and
relate it to math in some way.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, do they like baseball?&nbsp; Terrific.&nbsp;  During a
game, ask them how many points the losing team has to score
to beat the other one.&nbsp;  And how many games do they need to
win before they have enough points to win the league?</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If they enjoy helping around the home then let them do the
"clever stuff".&nbsp;  Ask them to work out the sizes for that
wood you're going to cut.&nbsp;  Or get them to measure out the
ingredients for the cake you're about to bake.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you're in a store, ask your kids to add up the prices
and keep a running total while you shop.&nbsp;  Then ask them how
much change you should expect at the checkout.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3. Take life "step-by-step".</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Success in math - as in life - is largely about breaking
large projects down into manageable, bite-sized pieces.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many kids feel overwhelmed when they see a list of math
questions, and it's at this point they may decide that math
is "<B>boring</B>" or "<B>hard</B>".</P>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/BOYSLEEP.GIF" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="130" ALT="boysleep.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Show them the magic of taking one question at a time, and
breaking it into tiny steps that make it easy.</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4. Encourage creativity.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kids may become mentally "stuck" on a topic because they're
only looking at it in one way.&nbsp; Perhaps they need to step
outside the box and see it from a different angle.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Show them the beauty of alternative viewpoints.&nbsp;  Help them
to see situations from other people's perspective.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Get them into the habit of exploring different ways of
solving a problem.&nbsp;  Even something simple like tidying up a
room can have several possible "solutions" or ways of
approaching it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crosswords and lateral thinking puzzles are good for this
kind of flexible thinking.</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5. Be positive.</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eliminate negative statements like "math is hard" (even if
you thought of yourself as a math dunce at school!).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Explain how everyone has a natural ability to do math and
that solving math problems isn't so different from solving
other kinds of problems in life.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, inspire confidence in your kids. &nbsp; Teach them
persistence and how there's always a solution to every
problem.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all perform better when we enjoy what we do, and getting
kids interested in math is the real key to success. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They may not turn into mathematical geniuses, but they'll
thank you in later life when they enter the world of work
and start counting their salaries.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
