<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have you ever wanted to do research on a topic and 
didn't feel like going to a specific search engine 
to do it?&nbsp; <B>Well, you don't have to.</B>&nbsp; If you download 
a "search toolbar," you can actually perform research 
from wherever you are online and do some other 
pretty cool things depending on which one you 
may be using.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the major search engines offer<B> "free search 
toolbars" </B>for download, to enhance your surfing 
experience and make tracking down information a  snap.&nbsp; 
You need to keep in mind that most toolbars will only 
work in Internet Explorer 5.0 and above.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let's review some of the most popular bars available 
for download:</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>1) Google:</B> <A HREF="http://toolbar.google.com">http://toolbar.google.com</A><BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The king of search engines, Google offers up a superb 
toolbar and my personal favorite.&nbsp; The latest version 
contains a pop up blocker, a mechanism to fill out 
online forms with one click, a way to check the page
rank of any site you may be visiting and more.&nbsp; Since 
Google also bought Blogger.com, members of that free 
service can also post to their personal Blogs with a 
click on the toolbar.</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>2) Yahoo:</B> <A HREF="http://companion.yahoo.com">http://companion.yahoo.com</A><BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With this you can bookmark your favorite websites,
search the web,peruse yellow pages and get notified 
of new Yahoo email you may have.&nbsp; If you'd like to 
refine your searches to just images or news, you 
can do that or check on your favorite stock quotes. &nbsp;
Click the included yellow marker and instantly
highlight the search words on any web page you're 
presently visiting.</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3) Hotbot:</B> <A HREF="http://www.hotbot.com/tools/">http://www.hotbot.com/tools/</A><BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hotbot allows you to search over 200 search sites
including Hotbot itself.&nbsp; This toolbar installs itself 
into your windows task bar (unlike the others, which 
attach themselves to your browser).</P>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>4) Alexa:</B> <A HREF="http://www.alexatoolbar.com">http://www.alexatoolbar.com</A><BR>

contains a popup stopper and combines Google search 
results with Alexa information.&nbsp; Search Amazon for

traffic ranking, find similar sites and use their

competition.&nbsp; Use the <B>"wayback machine"</B> to view

or within a particular site you're visiting.&nbsp; In

search and weather & zip code finder, this one will 
translate text or web pages into 10 different languages.</P>

<B>7) Ask Jeeves:</B> <A HREF="http://sp.ask.com/docs/toolbar">http://sp.ask.com/docs/toolbar/</A><BR>

sites suitable for children.&nbsp; Get financial info,
weather, news, search for local events or get a
map of any location in the U.S.&nbsp; Also includes

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see, your options for a toolbar are 
pretty impressive.&nbsp; But which one should you use? &nbsp;
That depends on which search engine is your favorite. &nbsp;
Most of them offer similar features and with the 
inclusion of popup blocking, that's one less piece
of software you need to have on your machine.</P>As you can see, your options for a toolbar are

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also toolbars served up by <B>"Meta Search 
Engines."</B>&nbsp; Meta engines do not maintain their own 
database, they actually query other major search
engines for their displayed results.&nbsp; So if you use
one of these toolbars you'll actually be doing a 
search across several different search engines at
one time.</P>
