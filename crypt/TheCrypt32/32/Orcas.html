<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  orca  or killer whale is a toothed whale that is an efficient
predator,  even attacking huge young blue whales.&nbsp; Their only enemy
is human beings.&nbsp;  Orcas live in small,  close-knit, life-long pods
and  have  1 blowhole.&nbsp;  The killer whale belongs to the family  of
dolphins  and is the biggest dolphin.&nbsp;  It is sometimes called  the
"<B>wolf  of  the  sea</B>" because its behavior is similar  to  that  of
wolves.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas  grow to be about 27-33 feet (8-10 m)  long,  weighing  more
than  8,000-12,000  pounds (3.600-5.400 kg). &nbsp;  The  male  orca  is
larger  than  the  female.&nbsp;  They are the  largest  member  of  the
dolphin family.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Orca's  skin is mostly black with distinctive white  patches.&nbsp;
Orcas  have  stocky bodies and a rounded head with  a  distinctive
beak.&nbsp;  They have a tall,  falcate (sickle-shaped)  dorsal fin  and
large,  paddle-like flippers.&nbsp; The dorsal fin of the male is taller
(up to 6 ft tall)  and more upright than that of the female (whose
dorsal fin is up to 4 ft tall).</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas are efficient hunters that eat a very diverse diet of  fish,
squid,   sharks,   marine mammals (including  whales  and  seals),
turtles,  octopi,  and birds (penguins and gulls).&nbsp;  They have even
been  known  to  attack young blue whales and other large  whales.&nbsp;
They  have  10-13 pairs of large,  interlocking conical,  enameled
teeth  distributed in BOTH the upper and lower jaws (for  a  total
of  20  to  26 pairs,  so the orca has from 40 to 52 teeth).&nbsp;   The
teeth curve inwards and backwards - this helps the orca catch  its
prey.&nbsp;  Teeth average about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and about 1 inch
in  diameter,   but  some  are even  longer.  &nbsp; Members  of  a  pod
frequently cooperate in hunts.  An average-sized orca will eat 551
pounds (250 kg) of food a day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas  live  in small pods of 6-40 whales;&nbsp;  they are  very  social
animals. &nbsp;  The bonds between the close-knit members of  Orca  pods
are  strong and last for life.&nbsp;  The members of a pod hunt together
in  a  very sophisticated manner,  attacking even very large  prey
and then sharing it. &nbsp; The pod members protect the young,  the sick
and the injured.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas  can dive to a depth of 100 feet (30 m)  in order  to  hunt.&nbsp;
Orcas  commonly  breach  (swim at  very  fast  speeds  toward  the
surface in order to rise above the surface of the water  and  then
fall  back  onto  the  surface,    splashing  and  making  noise).&nbsp;
Spyhopping  (poking the head out of the water to look around)   and
tail  slapping  are also common orca activities.&nbsp;  The  purpose  of
these activities is unknown.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas  breathe air at the surface of the water through a  blowhole
located  near the top of the head.&nbsp;  Their blow is a  single,   low
bushy cloud.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas are very fast swimmers.&nbsp;  They can swim up to  30  mph
(48 km) in bursts in order to catch prey.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orca   vocalizations   include   clicks   used   in
echolocation,  whistles,  and scream-like pulses. &nbsp; The sounds  are
used  to communicate with other orcas,  for mating purposes,   and
for  locating prey.&nbsp;  Different pods (long-lasting groups of orcas)
have  distinctive  "accents" and can  recognize  members  by  this
accent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas  whales live  in  waters  ranging  from
tropical  to  arctic,  and both coastal and deep  oceanic  waters.&nbsp;
They  are  found in all the world's oceans and most of  the  seas.&nbsp;
Orcas sometimes enter estuaries, but don't go far from the sea.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orcas don't make long,  seasonal migrations.&nbsp;  They  may,
however,   cover an area of hundreds of miles (or kilometers)   in
order to find seasonal prey.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orca breeding occurs mostly in the winter  to  early
spring  while near the surface and in warm waters. &nbsp; The  gestation
period  is  about  16-17 months and the calf is  born  tail  first
(this  is  normal  for cetaceans)  and near the surface,   usually
between October and March.&nbsp;  The newborn instinctively swims to the
surface  within 10 seconds for its first breath;  it is helped  by
its  mother,  using her flippers.&nbsp;  Within 30 minutes of its  birth
the baby whale can swim. &nbsp; The newborn calf is about 6.5-8 feet (2-
2.5  m)   long,   weighing up to 400 pounds (180 kg).   Twins  are
extremely  rare;  there is almost always one calf.&nbsp;   The  baby  is
nurtured  with its mother's milk.&nbsp;  The mother and  calf  may  stay
together for a year or longer.&nbsp;  Female orcas reach maturity at  6-
10 years old, and males at 12-16 years old.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Male  orcas  have a life expectancy  of  50-60  years.&nbsp;
Females have a life expectancy of 90 years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The species is in no danger as their numbers  are abundant.</P>
