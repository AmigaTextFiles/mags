<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmer John lived on a quiet rural highway.&nbsp; But, as time went by, the
traffic slowly built up at an alarming rate.&nbsp; The traffic was so heavy
and so fast that his chickens were being run over at a rate of three
to six a day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So one day Farmer John called the sheriff's office and said, "<B>You've got
to do something about all of these people driving so fast and killing
all of my chickens.</B>"&nbsp;"<I><B>What do you want me to do?</B></I>&nbsp; asked the sheriff.&nbsp; "<B>I
don't care, just do something about those crazy drivers!</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the next day he had the county workers go out and erected a sign that
said:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three days later Farmer John called the sheriff and said, "<B>You've got to
do something about these drivers.&nbsp; The 'school crossing' sign seems to
make them go even faster.</B>" &nbsp;So, again, the sheriff sends out the county
workers and they put up a new sign:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That really sped them up.&nbsp; So Farmer John called and called and called
every day for three weeks.&nbsp; Finally, he asked the sheriff, "<B>Your signs
are doing no good. Can I put up my own sign?</B>"&nbsp; The sheriff told him,
&nbsp;"<I><B>Sure thing, put up your own sign.</B></I>"&nbsp; He was going to let the Farmer John
do just about anything in order to get him to stop calling everyday to
complain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sheriff got no more calls from Farmer John.&nbsp; Three weeks later,
curiosity go the best of the sheriff and he decided to give Farmer
John a call.&nbsp; "<I><B>How's the problem with those drivers. Did you put up
your sign?</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Oh, I sure did. And not one chicken has been killed since then.&nbsp;
I've got to go.&nbsp; I'm very busy.</B>"&nbsp; He hung up the phone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sheriff was really curious now and he thought to himself, "I'd
better go out there and take a look at that sign... it might be
something that <B>WE</B> could use to slow down drivers..."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the sheriff drove out to Farmer John's house, and his jaw dropped
the moment he saw the sign.&nbsp; It was spray-painted on a sheet of wood:</P>
