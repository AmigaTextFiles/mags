<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Ladies and Gentlemen, I do apologise for the delay to your service.&nbsp; I know you're all dying to get home, unless, of course, you happen to be married to my ex-wife, in which case you'll want to cross over to the 
Westbound and go in the opposite direction".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Your delay this evening is caused by the line controller suffering from E & B syndrome, not knowing his elbow from his backside.&nbsp; I'll let you know any further information as soon as I'm given any."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Do you want the good news first or the bad news?&nbsp; The good news is that last Friday was my birthday and I hit the town and had a great time.&nbsp; The bad news is that there is a points failure somewhere between Stratford and East Ham, which means we probably won't reach our destination."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Ladies and gentlemen, we apologise for the delay, but there is a security alert at Victoria station and we are therefore stuck here for the foreseeable future, so let's take our minds off it and pass some
time together.&nbsp;&nbsp; All together now....'Ten green bottles, hanging on a wall.....'".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"We are now travelling through Baker Street, as you can see Baker Street is closed.&nbsp; It would have been nice if they had actually told me, so I could tell you earlier, but no, they don't think about things like that".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Beggars are operating on this train, please do <B>NOT</B> encourage these professional beggars, if you have any spare change, please give it to a registered charity, failing that, give it to me."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During an extremely hot rush hour on the Central Line, the driver announced in a West Indian drawl: "step right this way for the sauna, ladies and gentleman... unfortunately towels are not provided".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Let the passengers off the train FIRST!"&nbsp;(Pause ...) &nbsp;"Oh go on then, stuff yourselves in like sardines, see if I care - I'm going home...."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Please allow the doors to close.&nbsp;Try not to confuse this with&nbsp; 'Please hold the doors open'.&nbsp; The two are distinct and separate instructions."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Please note that the beeping noise coming from the doors means that the doors are about to close.&nbsp; It does not mean throw yourself or your bags into the doors."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We can't move off because some idiot has their f****ng hand stuck in the door"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"To the gentleman wearing the long grey coat trying to get on the second carriage - what part of 'stand clear of the doors' don't you understand?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Please move all baggage away from the doors&nbsp; (Pause..)&nbsp; Please move <B>ALL</B> belongings away from the doors&nbsp;(Pause...) &nbsp;This is a personal message to the man in the brown suit wearing glasses at the rear of the train - put the pie down, four-eyes, and move your bloody golf clubs away from the door before I come down there and shove them up your a**e sideways"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"May I remind all passengers that there is strictly no smoking allowed on any part of the Underground.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; if you are smoking a joint, it's only fair that you pass it round the rest of the carriage".</P>
