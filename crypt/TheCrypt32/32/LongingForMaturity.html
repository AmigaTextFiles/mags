<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I smoked my first cigarette when I was fourteen.&nbsp; It was all my own 
idea.&nbsp; No one held out a pack of smokes and tempted me.&nbsp; In fact, it 
started out as a very private affair, with me standing on the 
roadside trying in vain to light a cigarette from the pack I had 
saved every cent of my allowance for a week to buy.&nbsp; This was back in 
the forties, so they probably cost less than a dollar.&nbsp; Still, it was 
a lot of money to a young far girl who got about a quarter a week.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the wind kept blowing out my matches and I was getting mad.&nbsp; So 
engrossed was I in getting the damned thing lit that I didn't hear 
the truck pull up behind me until someone called to ask if I needed 
help.&nbsp; There I stood, tears of frustration streaming down my cheeks. &nbsp;
And there they sat, grins plastered all over their faces, the four 
o'clock drilling rig shift.&nbsp; One of them graciously leaned out the 
window and lit my cigarette with his lighter.&nbsp; Before I could choke 
out a teary tank you, they roared off in a cloud of dust leaving 
their laughter hanging on the air.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was I so determined to smoke?&nbsp; Because I was a late bloomer.&nbsp; There 
I was in a class of buxom girls who looked eighteen while I, skinny 
waif that I was, looked about ten.&nbsp; So I decided I had to do something 
to make myself appear older.&nbsp; <B>Smoking was the first step</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It wasn't easy becoming a smoker around parents who never indulged in 
tobacco.&nbsp; I had to be sure I didn't breathe my smoky breath in their 
faces.&nbsp; I had to make excuses about why my clothing smelled of smoke.&nbsp; 
I had to hide my cigarettes where they wouldn't accidentally find 
them.&nbsp; I discovered a crevice under a big rock in a neighbor's field 
and hid my precious pack there.&nbsp; Unfortunately the rains came and 
turned my hard-earned cigarettes into a useless soup of tobacco and 
soggy paper.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once I thought I had smoking mastered and made sure my school mates 
knew about it, I moved on to another step in my battle to come of 
age.&nbsp; All my friends bragged about their boyfriends.&nbsp; I needed a 
boyfriend.&nbsp; The boys in my school were all either involved with one of 
the other girls, not interested in me, or just plain repulsive so I 
decided to find one among the men I had ogled for so long in my movie 
magazines. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finally settled on dark, handsome Italian Rosanno Brazzi.&nbsp; I cut out 
his photo, carefully glued it onto the top of an old photograph and 
coated the entire thing with clear nail polish until it looked like a 
real photo - <B>almost</B>.&nbsp; My classmates didn't seem too impressed, but I 
thought I was rapidly moving toward maturity.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My figure, however, wasn't.&nbsp; I cajoled Mom into buying me a training 
bra.&nbsp; Then stuffed the cups with Kleenex until I developed an 
impressive, but bumpy bust line.&nbsp;  By this time I was sixteen, still 
skinny and still felt I was a misfit.&nbsp; One thing my boyfriend-less 
evenings did provide was free time, though, and I spent a lot of that 
baby-sitting.&nbsp;  Now I had a bit more money to spend and I discovered, 
in the lingerie department a wonderful product called falsies.&nbsp; I 
bought a larger bra and the falsies and finally, I thought, I was 
beginning to look like a woman.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I craved more.&nbsp; My enthusiasm (and the nail polish) was wearing 
off old Rosanni Brazzi.&nbsp; What I needed was a real boyfriend, and not 
one of those wimpy schoolboys.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I wanted an older man, one with a 
truck to take me places - and how I was going to get that past my 
parents I have no idea.&nbsp; I wanted a man who owned a lighter to light 
my cigarettes. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I found one easily enough.&nbsp; He looked after the oil wells that had 
invaded our farm.&nbsp; He drove from well to well, cleaning the sites, 
keeping an eye on the tanks, and doing handyman work.&nbsp; I had a horse 
and took to following him.&nbsp; I suppose today it would be called 
stalking.&nbsp; I'd  "accidentally" run into him three or four times a 
week.&nbsp; He didn't seem to mind my company and often paused in his work 
to chat, but he wasn't noticing me the way he was supposed to.&nbsp; <B>He 
wasn't seeing me as a woman</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One sunny afternoon I dressed in my shorts and tightest T-shirt 
(wearing my falsies, of course) and climbed on my horse.&nbsp; I found him 
at the far end of our property and stopped to light a cigarette 
before I approached him.&nbsp; I rode onto the well site and offered my 
sexiest smile.&nbsp; He smiled back.&nbsp; It was then I saw the bottle sitting 
on the truck and realized he'd been drinking.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was the day, too, that he really noticed me.&nbsp; His grin turned to 
a leer and he stumbled toward me where I sat frozen on my horse.&nbsp; He 
reached up and caressed my thigh with his dirty hand.&nbsp; Not wanting any 
more noticing, I slapped my horse with the reins and galloped away 
from him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Behind me I heard his laughter and it was reminiscent of that 
laughter long ago when I shed frustrated tears over an unlit 
cigarette.&nbsp; I rode my lathered horse into the corral and turned him 
loose.&nbsp; My mother was busy in the garden so I sneaked in the back door 
and into my room where I threw myself facedown on the bed and cried 
myself to sleep.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later that night, after a long bath that still left me feeling 
soiled, I threw my falsies into the garbage, ripped my cigarettes 
into shreds and scattered the remains in the bush.&nbsp; Maybe I wasn't 
quite ready for maturity.&nbsp; Maybe it would be better to remain a skinny 
little farm girl for a little while longer. </P>
