<P ALIGN="LEFT">If  this  hasn't already happened to you,  it probably will .</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  have a piece of e-mail ready to go out,  you try to send  it,
and  it  won't  go. &nbsp; All you get is an error message during  every
send cycle.&nbsp; The e-mail seems like it's "<B>stuck</B>" in your outbox.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes  it  can  get  even  worse (especially  with  Outlook  /
Outlook  Express). &nbsp; You may have a piece of e-mail  come  in  that
causes  your computer or e-mail client to lock up when you  select
(click) it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What can you do?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  first  thing to try is going to the e-mail  in  question  and
deleting it.&nbsp;  If it's in your outbox, go to your outbox, highlight
the e-mail, and hit your <B>Delete key</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  if  that piece of e-mail is causing your e-mail  program  to
lock up?&nbsp; Well, don't worry, there's still hope.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  of the time those lockups are due to something in the e-mail
itself.&nbsp;  It could be a bad script,  corrupt sound, errant piece of
coding,  or any number of other problems. &nbsp; When you click  the  e-
mail,  it automatically opens in the preview pane and locks things
up before you can get to the Delete key.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  solution  is  to temporarily close that preview  pane,   then
select  and delete the e-mail.&nbsp;  I've never seen that little  trick
not work.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  how do you close the preview pane? Easy!  (instructions below
are for Outlook Express)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Hit  OK</B>&nbsp;  and  you  should be able to go in and  get  rid  of  that
problematic  e-mail. &nbsp; Once it's history,  just  follow  the  steps
above, but this time check the preview pane box.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Back to normal again!</P>
