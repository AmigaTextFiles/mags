<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  minke  whale is the smallest baleen whale with  50-70  throat
grooves. &nbsp;  It  is  a  rorqual  whale  (baleen  whale  with  throat
grooves).&nbsp;  They are the most abundant baleen whale. &nbsp; Minke  whales
have  a  characteristic  white band on each flipper,   contrasting
with  its very dark gray top color.&nbsp;  They have 2 blowholes,   like
all baleen whales.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke  whales grow to be about 25-30 feet (7.8-9  m)   long,
weighing about 6-7.5 tons (5.4-6.8 tonnes)..&nbsp;  Females are about  2
feet (0.6 m)  longer than males,  as with all baleen whales.&nbsp;   The
largest minke whale was about 35 feet (10.5 m)  long weighing  9.5
tons  (8.6  tonnes).. &nbsp;   Minke   whales   have  a  snout  that  is
distinctively  triangular,    narrow,    and  pointed  (hence  its
nicknames "sharp-headed finner" and "little piked whale").</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The minke whale's skin is very  dark  gray
above  and lighter below,  sometimes with pale trapezoidal stripes
behind  the  flippers   on   the   top. &nbsp;   Minke   whales  have  a
characteristic white band on each flipper (this is absent  on  the
southern minke whales).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales are stocky,  having a layer of blubber several inches
thick.&nbsp;  They have 50-70 throat grooves,  running from the chin  to
the mid-section. &nbsp; The minke whale has two long flippers (up to 1/8
of  the  body size),  a small dorsal fin,  and a series  of  small
ridges along the its back near the flukes (tail).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke  whales (like  all  baleen  whales)   are
seasonal  feeders and carnivores. &nbsp; They sieve  through  the  ocean
water  with their baleen.&nbsp;  They filters out small polar  plankton,
krill,   and  small  fish,   even  chasing  schools  of  sardines,
anchovies,  cod,  herring, and capelin.&nbsp; They have the same diet as
blue whales.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  baleen plates in the minke whale's jaws have about 300  pairs
of short,  smooth baleen plates.&nbsp; The largest plates are about less
than 12 inches (30 cm)  long and 5 inches (13 cm)  wide. &nbsp; The fine
textured  baleen  bristles are fringed and are  creamy-white  with
pure white bristles..</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales either travel singly or congregated  in
small pods of about 2-3 whales.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales can dive for up to 20-25 minutes,  but usually
make  shorter  dives,  lasting about 10-12 minutes.&nbsp;   Just  before
diving,  minke whales arch their back to a great degree,  but  the
flukes do not rise out of the water.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales breathe air at the surface of  the
water  through 2 blowholes located near the top of the  head.&nbsp;   At
rest,   minke whales spout (breathe)  about 5-6 times per  minute.&nbsp;
The  spout of the minke whale is a very low,  almost inconspicuous
stream  that  rises up to 6.5 feet (2 m)  above the water. &nbsp;  Minke
whales  start  to  exhaling before they reach the  surface;   this
minimizes the blow.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales normally swim 3-16 mph (4.8-25 kph),  but  can
go up to 18-21 mph (29-34 kph)  in bursts when in danger.&nbsp; Feeding
speeds are slower, about 1-6 mph (1.6-9.8 kph).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke  whales makes very loud  sounds,   up  to  152
decibels (as loud as a jet taking off). &nbsp; They make series (trains)
of grunts,  thuds,  and raspy sounds, usually in the 100-200 Hertz
range.&nbsp;  These sounds may be used in communication with other minke
whales and in echolocation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke whales live at the surface of  the  ocean
in all but polar seas.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minke  whale breeding  occurs  mostly  in  the  late
winter  to early spring while near the surface and in warm waters.&nbsp;
The  gestation period is about 10 months and the calf is born near
the  surface  of   the   warm,    shallow   waters.&nbsp;   The  newborn
instinctively  swims  to the surface within  10  seconds  for  its
first  breath;  it is helped by its mother,  using  her  flippers.&nbsp;
Within  30  minutes  of its birth the baby whale  can  swim. &nbsp;  The
newborn calf is about 9 feet (2.8 m)  long and weighs about  1,000
pounds (454 kg).&nbsp;  The baby is nurtured with its mother's milk.&nbsp; The
mother  and  calf may stay together for a year or  longer. &nbsp;  Minke
whales reach puberty at 2 years of age.</P>

LIFE SPAN Minke whales have a life expectancy of over 20 years.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">POPULATION COUNT Minke whales are the most abundant baleen  whale.&nbsp;
It  is  estimated that there are about almost 800,000 minke whales
world-wide.</P>
