<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived on Earth. &nbsp; It
is  also the loudest animal on Earth.&nbsp;  These enormous mammals  eat
tiny organisms,  like plankton and krill, which they sieve through
baleen.&nbsp;  They live in pods (small groups).&nbsp;  These gray-blue whales
have 2 blowholes and a 2-14 inch (5-30 cm) thick layer of blubber.&nbsp;
Blue  whales are rorqual whales,  whales that have pleated  throat
grooves  that allow their throat to expand during the huge  intake
of  water  during filter feeding. &nbsp; Blue whales have  50-70  throat
grooves that run from the throat to mid-body.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales  grow  to be about 80 feet (25 m)  long  on  average,
weighing about 120 tons (109 tonnes). &nbsp; The largest specimen  found
was  a  female  94 feet (29 m)  long weighing more 174  tons  (158
tonnes).&nbsp;  The females are larger than males,  as with  all  baleen
whales. &nbsp;  The largest of the blue whales (150 tons)  has  a  heart
that  weighs  about 1,000 pounds (450 kg)  and has  14,000  pounds
(6,400 kg)  of blood circulating in its body. &nbsp; The heart is  about
the size of a Volkswagon beetle car.&nbsp;  A human could crawl through the
aorta (a major blood vessel).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales are the loudest animals on Earth!&nbsp;  Their call reaches
levels  up  to  188 decibels.&nbsp;  This low-frequency whistle  can  be
heard for hundreds of miles. &nbsp; The blue whale is louder than a jet,
which  reaches only 140 decibels!&nbsp;  Human shouting is 70  decibels;&nbsp;
sounds over 120 decibels are painful to human ears.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  blue whale's skin is usually blue-gray with white-gray spots.&nbsp;
The  underbelly has brown,  yellow,  or gray specks. &nbsp;  During  the
winter in cold waters,  diatoms stick to the underbelly, giving it
a  yellow  to silver- to sulfur-colored sheen; &nbsp; they are sometimes
called "sulfur bottom."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have a very small,  falcate (sickle-shaped)  dorsal fin  that
is  located near the flukes (tail).&nbsp;  Blue whales have long,   thin
flippers 8 feet long (2.4 m)  and flukes that are 25 feet (7.6  m)
wide.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales&nbsp;  (like all baleen whales)&nbsp;  are seasonal  feeders  and
carnivores  that  filter feed tiny crustaceans (krill,   copepods,
etc.),  plankton, and small fish from the water.&nbsp; They are gulpers,
filter  feeders that alternatively swim then gulp  a  mouthful  of
plankton  or  fish  - they lunge into dense groups  of  small  sea
organisms  (krill or tiny fish)  with an open  mouth. &nbsp;  50  to  70
throat pleats allow the throat to expand a great deal,  forming  a
gular  pouch.&nbsp;  The water is then forced through the baleen  plates
hanging from the upper jaw.  The baleen catches the food,   acting
like a sieve.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  blue  whale has about 320 pairs of black baleen  plates  with
dark  gray bristles in the blue whale's jaws.&nbsp;  They are  about  39
inches long (1 m),  21 inches wide (53 cm),  and weigh 200  pounds
(90 kg).&nbsp; The tongue weighs 4 tons (3.8 tonnes).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  average-sized blue whale will eat 2,000-9,000 pounds (900-4100
kg)   of  plankton  each day during the summer feeding  season  in
cold, arctic waters ( about 120 days).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales can dive for up to an hour,  going to a depth of  350
feet (105 m).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales  breathe air at the surface of the  water  through  2
blowholes located near the top of the head.&nbsp;  They spout  (breathe)
about  1-4  times per minute at rest,  and 5-12 times per  minutes
after a deep dive.&nbsp;  Their blow is a single stream that rises 40-50
feet (12-15 m) above the surface of the water.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales are very fast swimmers;  they normally swim 3-20  mph
(4.8-32  kph),  but can go up to 24-30 mph (38-48 kph)  in  bursts
when in danger.&nbsp;  Feeding speeds are slower, about 1-4 mph (1.6-6.2
kph).</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whales emit very loud,  highly structured,  repetitive  low-
frequency sounds that can travel for many miles underwater.&nbsp;   They
are probably the loudest animals alive,  louder than a jet engine.&nbsp;
These  songs may be used for locating large masses of krill  (tiny
crustaceans that they eat)  and for communicating with other  blue
whales, especially in order to attract and find mates</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue whales live at the surface of the ocean and are found in  all
the oceans of the world.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue  whale  breeding occurs mostly in the winter to early  spring
while  near the surface and in warm waters.&nbsp;  The gestation  period
is  about  11-12 months and the calf is born tail first  (this  is
normal  for  cetaceans)  and near the surface  in  warm,   shallow
waters. &nbsp; The newborn instinctively swims to the surface within  10
seconds for its first breath;  it is helped by its mother,   using
her  flippers. &nbsp; Within 30 minutes of its birth the baby whale  can
swim.&nbsp#  The newborn calf is about 25 feet long (7.6 m)  and  weighs
about  6-8 tons (5.4-7.3 tonnes). &nbsp; Twins are extremely rare (about
1%  of  births);  there is almost always one calf. &nbsp;  The  baby  is
nurtured with its mother's fat-laden milk (it is 40-50% fat)   and
is  weaned in about 7-8 months.&nbsp;  Calves drink 50-200 pounds (23-90
kg)  of milk each day.&nbsp; The mother and calf may stay together for a
year or longer,  until the calf is about 45 feet long (13 m).&nbsp; Blue
whales reach maturity at 10-15 years.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Packs of killer whales (orcas)  have been known to attack and kill
young  blue  whales.&nbsp;   Man  also  hunted  blue  whales  until  the
International Whaling Commission declared them to be  a  protected
species in 1966 because of a huge decrease in their population.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blue whales have a life expectancy of 35-40 years.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  estimated that there are about 10,000-14,000  blue  whales
world-wide. &nbsp; Blue whales are an endangered species.&nbsp;  These  whales
(and  many  other large whales)  were over-hunted for many  years,
since  their meat,  oil,  and other body parts are very  valuable.&nbsp;
Since  whale hunting has decreased in the last few decades,  their
populations are starting to recover.</P>
