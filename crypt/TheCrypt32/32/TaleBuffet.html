<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My life working in the catering store in Inverness had settled in
nicely.&nbsp; I was happy at work and my wife had just given birth to
our second son.&nbsp; As is the way, When things are content and
settled, Life has a nasty habit of kicking you in the teeth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had been in the stores for some two years now, It was evident
that something was happening in the background.&nbsp; Several high
ranking officials had been visiting Mr. Pollock, and he had gone
quiet and moody.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rumours flowed, Mostly that Bill Pollock was under pressure to
retire early.&nbsp; Personally I didn't agree, Bill Pollock ran a tight
ship and was far to good at his job for that, Mind you he didn't
mince his words and had made a  few enemies through the years.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Fateful day</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day started pretty much as all the others.&nbsp; It had been quite a
few weeks since i had a good chat with Mr. Pollock, but this day I
got his famous Phone call</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Ian ... Grab two coffees and come into the office</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carrying the two hot cups I knocked and entered the office, Bill
Pollock sat alone doing some paperwork.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After several minutes Bill looked up and asked how things were
with me.&nbsp; Assuming he meant the Stores I proceeded to give him the
last audit report.</P>

<B>"NO ...How are things with YOU "</B>&nbsp; he asked.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I spent the next few minutes telling him of my personal life.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill leaned over and opened a drawer in his desk.&nbsp; He produced a
document, looked at it for several seconds then passed it over to
me.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I picked up the document and glanced at it.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="LEFT">Catering Internal Vacancies</P></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every month the catering division of British rail posted this list
of available positions on the notice board.&nbsp; Interested applicants
applied for which ever job they liked.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having glanced at the sheets in my hand, I looked back at Bill
Pollock .. Obviously I was missing something.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill looked straight into my eyes and said "<B>Second page ...third
down</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turned to the second page and read the third vacancy advertised.</P>
<BR></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
<B><CENTER><U>"Train Catering - "Assistant Circuit group Manager" - Aberdeen"</U></CENTER></B>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"To take charge of all High Speed Restaurant cars and Scottish
internal catering services in and out of Aberdeen station."</P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=Aqua>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Still not quite understanding I looked again to bill Pollock.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His hand delved into the desk drawer once again, and he produced a
second sheet ... An application form which had been completed apart
from the signature, He passed this to me and said.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Apply for it"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I must have looked a bit foolish, I just sat there, I couldn't
talk and my heart was racing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Sign it!"</B>&nbsp; said Bill Pollock.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I shook my head slowly,&nbsp; <I><B>"But I know nothing about High speed trains!"</B></I></P>

<B>"No matter ... Do you need time to think about it?"</B>&nbsp; asked Mr. Pollock

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I nodded.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>"Take it home then, talk it over with your wife, But bring the
forms back in tomorrow."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Pollock said nothing more, but returned to his paperwork,
Making it all to obvious that the session was over.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rest of the day seemed to pass very slowly, My mind was racing
trying to figure out why he wanted me to apply for this position
in Aberdeen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those days, in the Railway, Staff that were unsuitable for
their positions were often taken in and TOLD to apply for another
vacancy ... Side stepping and moving problem staff around was
fairly common.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I racked my brains trying to think of any reason that I had
perhaps offended someone .. But could think of none.&nbsp; The Auditors
who visited the stores each month had always given me a glowing
report .. Suddenly it dawned on me that what was being offered was
promotion, I wasn't being punished or sidestepped.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again in those day in the Railway, If you were not seen to be
applying for various positions, It was considered that you were
unambitious, or content where you were, often meaning that you got
passed over for future promotions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That evening I had a long chat with my wife concerning this
application.&nbsp; It was pretty obvious to me that I wouldn't get the
position, But had to show the "Big Bosses" that I had certain
ambitions.&nbsp; Actually my wife seemed quite happy for me to apply for
the position, So I signed the form.&nbsp; The following morning i
returned them both to Bill Pollock.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He briefly looked at the application form, Nodded his head, and
returned to his work.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I returned to the store, unsure if I was sad or angry, I certainly
had expected some sort of reaction from Bill Pollock, but had
received none.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I kept a low profile for the next couple of weeks, But eventually
I was again summoned to Mr. Pollock's office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little was said,&nbsp; Bill just handed me an envelope containing 2
train passes and sleeper reservations.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"You leave tomorrow night"</B> he said <B>"Good luck with the Interview"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This strange attitude from Mr. Pollock remained unexplained for
some 5 years.&nbsp; It was at his retiral party that Bill eventually
told me the full story of events.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After joining the stores at Inverness, Bill said that he spotted a
certain potential in me.&nbsp; It was his dearest hope that after a
suitable time in the Stores that he would persuade me to join as
Manager in the catering unit in Inverness, to be groomed to take
over his position as Area Manager when he retired.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However internal politics at this time had decided that Train and
Station catering would be a separate concern.&nbsp; Station catering to
continue under the Banner of "Travellers Fare" and train catering
to become a new company called "ICOBS" (Inter City onboard
Services). It had been decided that I would come under the banner
of ICOBS.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality this made little difference to me, However there was an
agreement that persons in one catering service could not apply for
"The other side" while still in employment.&nbsp; Thus the trading of
staff between train catering and station catering would have to
cease.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I was virtually responsible for running not only the stores but
most day to day things for train catering in Inverness, Bill
recognised that I was too indispensable to earn promotion and
would be kept in the stores job for life, when I came under the ICOBS banner.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill Pollock knew that if i was to progress any further in my career in the Railway Catering services, i had to be persuaded to leave the Stores job in Inverness.</P>
