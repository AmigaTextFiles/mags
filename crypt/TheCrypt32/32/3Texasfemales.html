<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These three women go down to Mexico one night, get drunk,  and wake up in
jail only to find out that they are to be executed in the morning, though
none of them can remember what they did the night before. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first one, a brunette, is strapped in the electric chair and is asked if
she has any last words.&nbsp; She says, <B>"I am from the Baylor School of Divinity,
and I believe in the almighty power of God to intervene on  behalf of the
innocent."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They throw the switch and nothing happens, so they figure God
must not want this woman to die and they let her go.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second one, a
redhead, is strapped in and gives her last words, 
<B>"I am from the Texas Tech University School of Law and I believe in the
power of justice to intervene on the part of the innocent."</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They throw the
switch and again nothing happens.&nbsp; They figure that the law is on this woman
s side, so they let her go too.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last one, a blond, is strapped in and
says, <B>"Well, I'm a Texas Aggie Electrical Engineer, and I'll tell you right now you  ain't gonna
electrocute nobody if you don't connect them two wires."</B></P>
