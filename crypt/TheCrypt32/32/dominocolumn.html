<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm in the Doghouse again.&nbsp; <B>Not</B> my fault,&nbsp; It's you humans that are
unpredictable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well you know that we have been having good weather lately, So
good in fact that during the day it was warm enough to lie out in
the Garden.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now for some reason "<B>Old Grumbleguts</B>" has decided to do quite a
bit of reconstruction in the little plot.&nbsp; So this day I was lying
on the warm lawn keeping my little eye on him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He emerged from the garden shed with his tools and started digging.&nbsp;
Nothing unusual in that ... He often digs these little hole and
tries to hide bushes and flowers in them&nbsp; (What's the point ...He only
moans if I pee on them).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However this day was different, He Dug and Dug and Dug, Eventually
he was so far down, only half of his body was visible!</P>

"<B>What on earth is he doing</B>" I wondered.&nbsp; <B>Then it struck me!</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The silly old codger had buried his bone in the garden and now he
couldn't find it.&nbsp; Well I'm a nice Dog, so I thought I'll give him
a hand .. Well we all know that us doggies smell better than you
Humans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So I wandered down to where his hole was, Planted my back legs and
started digging furiously with my front Paws.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Was he happy .... <B>Nope!</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was he Grateful ....<B>Nope!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He gave out this scream ...and started clambering out of his hole
with a mean look on his face.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>NOW</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a brave doggie, But a demented Human, covered in Mud,
Frothing at the mouth and waving a stainless steel spade in my
direction, is a bit to much.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Best beat a hasty retreat</B>
&nbsp; I thought ...In the back door, Through
the Kitchen ...Across the Hall ...Up the Stairs ...into a Bedroom
and under a Bed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Phew!</B> .. Safe&nbsp; he'll never find me here.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suddenly, For no reason <B>Mrs. Grumbleguts</B> decides to get in to the
action. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>I'll Kill that bloody Dog, Look at the state of my carpets!</B>"</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suddenly she was upstairs, lying on the floor and prodding 
    at me with a broom handle&nbsp; ( I didn't know Humans were so good at tracking).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Two hours I stayed under that bed</B>, Eventually I decided to forgive
them and wandered into the living room, I let them ruffle my ears
and rub my belly&nbsp; (That always seems to calm them down when they
get stressed).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway a couple of days later, This bloody great hole is still
there.&nbsp; However <B>Grumbleguts</B> fixed up the garden hose and started filling
it with water!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Well!</B> ...It was 12.30 &nbsp;(Half an hour late with my walk)&nbsp; so I though
to my self ... I'll help him fill the hole with water,&nbsp; That way, I
relieve myself, and he doesn't need to take me out.&nbsp; (Sound good to
me ... I'm a helpful doggie)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>SHRIEK</B> ... Another demented Scream ... Another chasing&nbsp; (With the
Rake this time).</P>
