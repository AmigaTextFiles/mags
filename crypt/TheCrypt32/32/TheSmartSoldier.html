  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Pentagon recently discovered it had too many generals and offered
 an early retirement. Any general who retired would get his full annual
 benefits plus <B>$10,000</B> for every inch measured between any two points of
 the body.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The first one, an Air Force general, asked to be measured from the top
 of his head to the tip of his toes. He got a check for $720,000.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The second one, an Army general, wanted to be measured from the tip of
 his outstretched arm to his toes. He walked out with a check for
 $960,000.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The third general, a grizzly old Marine, wanted to be measured from the
 tip of his penis to the bottom of his testicles. The pension man
 suggested that perhaps he might like to reconsider, pointing out the
 nice fat checks the two previous generals received.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Marine insisted. So the medical officer started measuring. The
 medical officer placed the tape on the tip of the general's penis and
 began to measure. "<B>My God!</B>" he said. "<B>Where are your testicles?</B>"  The
 general replied, "<B>In Vietnam</B>."</P>
