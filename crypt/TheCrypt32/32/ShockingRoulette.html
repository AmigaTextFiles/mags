 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Russian Roulette has to be the ultimate game of chance. &nbsp;  Now  you
can  experience the fear and anticipation in your  own  home  with
this `shocking' new game.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now don't worry that we're advocating playing with guns.&nbsp;  Shocking
Roulette  doesn't feature bullets,  and you won't have  to  scrape
anybody's  brains  off  the  floor afterwards  in  a  Deer  Hunter
style. &nbsp; But you will have to face your fears and leave your  fate
to chance, or end up looking like a prize wuss.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shocking  Roulette is an electronic game for 2 - 4 players. &nbsp;  Each
player  places  their finger in one of the  holes  on  the  board.&nbsp;
Press the start button,  and the agonising wait begins.&nbsp; A flashing
light makes its way around the board,  accompanied by the sound of
a roulette wheel. &nbsp; As it slows,  the tension reaches fever pitch -
and  then  it stops.&nbsp;  And one unlucky player receives  a  jolt  of
electricity through his or her finger!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shocking  Roulette is great for parties,  the pub or lads'  nights
in,   and  is a great way to make cheapskates get their round  in;
you'll be amazed at how quickly they disappear to the bar.&nbsp;   Until
you  actually  play  it's  hard   to   understand  just  what  the
anticipation  feels like. &nbsp; But whatever you do,  keep  control  of
your nerves - if you sweat, the shock gets worse.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are  you man,  or woman,  enough to face the challenge of Shocking
Roulette?&nbsp;  Can  you avoid screaming like a big sissy  if  you  get
shocked?&nbsp; The choice is yours:&nbsp;  risk a mild electric shock, or risk
making a complete turkey of yourself by wimping out.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Please  note:</B>&nbsp;   The  mild electric shock  you  get  from  Shocking
Roulette is completely harmless. &nbsp; However,  it can interfere  with
pacemakers,   so  if you use one,  we don't recommend  this  game.&nbsp;
Also,   Shocking  Roulette should not  be  used  by  sufferers  of
epilepsy or related illnesses.</P>
