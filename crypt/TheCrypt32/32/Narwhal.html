<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Narwhal (meaning "corpse whale" in Old Norse)   is  a  rarely
seen  Arctic whale.&nbsp;  This social whale is known for the <B>VERY</B>  long
tooth that males have.&nbsp; Very little is known about this whale.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw. &nbsp;  After
the  first  year of a male narwhal's life,  its left  tooth  grows
outward,   spirally. &nbsp; This long,  single tooth projects  from  its
upper  jaw and can grow to be 7-10 feet (2-3 m)  long.&nbsp;  Tusks  are
usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and have a  hollow
interior. &nbsp; The tusk's function is uncertain,  perhaps  used  as  a
formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry,  in
obtaining food,  and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses
(which  they emit).&nbsp;  The tusk is not used in hunting. &nbsp;  Long  ago,
narwhal sightings reinforced (or started) the unicorn legends.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Narwhals  can grow to be about 16 feet (4.9  m)   long  (not
counting  the  tooth),  and weigh about  1.8  tons  (1.6  tonnes).&nbsp;
Females are slightly smaller,  averaging about 13 feet (4 m) long,
and weighing 1 ton (0.9 tonnes).&nbsp;  At birth,  narwhals are about  5
feet (1.5 m) long and 175 pounds (80 kg).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Narwhal means "corpse whale" in Old Norse;  this is
perhaps  a  description of their skin,  which is bluish-gray  with
white  blotches  (young  narwhals are  brown). &nbsp;  Narwhals  have  a
cylindrical  body (with no dorsal fin)  and a round  head  with  a
small mouth on their blunt snout.&nbsp;  This compact body shape plus  a
thick  layer of blubber retains heat in the icy Arctic  waters  in
which they live.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Narwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas.&nbsp;   They
rarely  stray  far  from ice.&nbsp;  In summer they  infrequently  enter
estuaries, deep fjords, and bays.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The duration of a narwhal dive is from 7-20 minutes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Narwhals are a very vocal species of whale,   making
clicks, squeals, and whistles to communicate and/or navigate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Narwhals maximum life span is about 50 years.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Narwhals eat fish, squid, shrimp, and other marine animals.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pods (social groups of whales)  of  4-20  narwhals
have  been  observed;  some groups consist of  just  one  sex  and
others contain both sexes. &nbsp; Many pods may travel together, forming
very large groups.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that there are roughly 10,000  to
45,000  narwhals.&nbsp;  Narwhals are preyed upon by man (Inuit  hunters
legally hunt narwhals), polar bears, orcas, sharks, and walruses.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Narwhal's gestation  period  is  10-16  months.&nbsp;
Calves  are brown and have no spots (unlike adults who  are  blue-
gray  with whitish spots).&nbsp;  Calves are nursed for about  4  months
after birth.</P>
