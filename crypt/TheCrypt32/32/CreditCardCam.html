<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introducing the world's thinnest digital camera.&nbsp;  The Credit  Card
Camera really does fit in your wallet!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As its name suggests,  the Credit Card Camera is the same size  as
an  everyday credit or debit card.&nbsp;  Measuring just 8 x 5cm,   less
than half a centimetre thick,  and weighing just 35 grams,  you'll
never  find  a more portable camera. &nbsp; But this isn't some  novelty
item  that's  all about the size.&nbsp;  It's actually a genuinely  high
quality digital camera.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite  its  tiny  size,   the sleek silver  Credit  Card  Camera
manages to cram in a 64MB SDRAM memory. &nbsp; Store up to 26 images  in
high res mode,  and 104 in low res mode.&nbsp;  It also features its own
built-in  viewfinder!   And a major feature  of  the  Credit  Card
Camera  is  its revolutionary battery which re-charges  while  you
download pictures to your PC - a brilliant time-saver.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Credit Card Camera is easy to use,  and also boasts  an  Auto
Exposure  and white balance adjuster,  to give crisper  detail  in
bright and dim areas of a picture. &nbsp; You'll be pleasantly surprised
by the picture quality.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  can take the Credit Card Camera anywhere. &nbsp; Why carry a heavy,
bulky  camera  around with you on holiday,  on excursions  or  day
trips?&nbsp; This slips unnoticed you're your pocket,  bag, or of course
your wallet.&nbsp; It's the ultimate convenient camera.</P>
