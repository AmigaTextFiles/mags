<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  young man was lost wandering in a forest,  when he came upon  a
small house.&nbsp;  He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient
Chinese man with a long,  grey beard.&nbsp;  "<B>I'm lost,</B>"&nbsp; said  the  man.</P>

"<B>Can  you  put me up for the night?</B>"&nbsp; "<I><B>Certainly</B></I>," the Chinese  man
said, &nbsp; "<I><B>but on one condition.&nbsp; If you so much as lay a finger on my
daughter,&nbsp;   I  will  inflict  upon you  the  three  worst  Chinese
tortures known to man.</B></I>"



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Ok</B>,"&nbsp; said the man,  thinking that the daughter must be pretty old
as well, and entered the house.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before dinner,  the daughter came down the stairs.&nbsp;  She was young,
beautiful,   and  had  a  fantastic  figure. &nbsp;  She  was  obviously
attracted  to the young man since she couldn't keep her  eyes  off
him  during  the  meal.&nbsp;  Remembering the old  man's  warning,   he
ignored  her and went up to bed alone.&nbsp;  But during the night,   he
could bear it no longer,  and sneaked into her room for a night of
passion. &nbsp; He was careful to keep everything quiet so the  old  man
wouldn't  hear.&nbsp;  Near dawn he crept back to his room,   exhausted,
but happy.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  woke to feel a pressure on his chest.  Opening his eyes he saw
a  large  rock on his chest with a note on it that read, <FONT COLOR=BLUE> <B>"Chinese
Torture 1:  Large rock on chest." </B></font></P><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Well, that's pretty crappy,</B>" he
thought.  "<B>If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have
much  to worry about.</B>&nbsp;" He picked the boulder up,  walked  over  to
the  window  and threw the boulder out.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he did so  he  noticed
another note on it that read:<FONT COLOR=BLUE>&nbsp; <B> "Chinese Torture 2:  Rock  tied  to
left  testicle."</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope  that
was  already getting close to the end.&nbsp;  Figuring that a few broken
bones  was  better than castration,  he jumped out of  the  window
after  the boulder.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he plummeted downward he saw a large  sign
on the ground that read, &nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLUE> <B>"Chinese Torture 3:  Right testicle tied
to bedpost."</B></font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
