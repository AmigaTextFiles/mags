<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you feel it, that crisp feeling in the air as the autumn winds
reach out and lightly touch our senses?&nbsp; There's magic in the air
as Mother earth paints beautiful scenes of colors all around us.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nights are cooler, so I pull out the blankets, hanging them out
on the clothesline to freshen them before placing them on each
bed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pumpkins appear at farmers markets while baskets of apples are
sold to merchants wanting to make apple butter and pies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last of the hummingbirds come and go to the feeder seemingly
saying goodbye for another season.&nbsp; They will return in the spring
when it's warmer to bless us with their beauty.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The afternoon sun shines in my south window onto my crystals
causing them to shine all around the room making little rainbows
and dancing colors.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wash my favorite sweater, the one that makes me feel so
comfortable and warm on the cool afternoons and chilly nights,
even if it is old and worn.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon there will be frost on the windows and you'll be able to see
your breath as you walk through the trees and autumn pathways.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I watch the wind dance with a leaf, twirling and turning it with
grace.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sipping hot chocolate is soo good in the morning while I watch
the birds play and the deer slowly leave the garden area where
they look for leftover morsels.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I love the feel of autumn magic and I am happy to be reminded of
the miracles of life, as I watch the Seasons come and go.&nbsp; I close
my eyes and feel the cool air on my face and thank Spirit once
again, for sharing the magic of autumn with me once more.</P>
