<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sperm whale is a toothed whale that  lives
in  pods. &nbsp; It has a huge brain that weighs about 20 pounds (9 kg);
it  is  the  largest brain of any animal.&nbsp;  The sperm whale  has  a
single  blowhole that is s-shaped and about 20 inches  long.&nbsp;   The
blowhole  is  located on the left side of the front  if  its  huge
head.&nbsp; The sperm whale has a 4-12 inch thick layer of blubber.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm  whales produce ambergris,  a dark,  waxy substance (related
to cholesterol)  that is produced in the lower intestines,  and is
sometimes  found  containing  squid  beaks. &nbsp;  Ambergris  may  help
protect  the sperm whale from the stings on the giant squid,   its
major  food. &nbsp; Large lumps of ambergris may be vomited  up  by  the
sperm whale.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The fictional <B>Moby Dick</B> was a sperm whale.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm  whales are the largest toothed whales. &nbsp;  Adult  males
grow to be about 50-60 feet (17-20 m)  long,  weighing about 40-50
tons (36-45 tonnes).&nbsp;  Females are smaller, about 33-40 feet (11-13
m)  long,  weighing about 14-18 tons. &nbsp; The four-chambered heart of
the  average sperm whale weighs about 277 pounds (126 kg)  - about
as much as two average adult human beings.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The skin is usually dark gray to black,  but
is  occasionally  light  gray.  It has a distinctive,   prune-like
texture.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales have the largest head of any animal. &nbsp; It can be about
20  feet  long  (6 m),  10 feet high (3 m),  and 7  feet  (2.1  m)
across,   and is about one-third of the whale's body length.&nbsp;   The
head  has  a distinctive box-like shape.&nbsp;  The heads are frequently
covered  with circular scars that are made by the suckers  of  the
giant squid that they hunt and eat.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has 5-foot (1.5 m)  long flippers that are about 3 feet (0.9 m)
wide.&nbsp;  There is no dorsal fin but there is a small hump two-thirds
of  the way down its back. &nbsp; There are also some ridges between the
hump and the tail flukes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  sperm whale was named for the valuable  spermaceti
oil  (wax)   that  this  whale produces in  the  spermaceti  organ
(located in its head).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales are carnivores that mostly
eat  giant  squid that live on the ocean bottom at  great  depths.&nbsp;
They also eat fish,  octopus, and skate.&nbsp; In 1998, off the coast of
Indonesia,  3 sperm whales were observed attacking a rare,  filter
feeding megamouth shark.&nbsp;  An adult Sperm Whale can eat about a ton
of food each day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm  whale teeth are uniform.&nbsp;  The teeth in the upper jaw  never
erupt.&nbsp;   The  teeth in the long,  thin lower jaw are  conical  and
huge,   about 7 inches (18 cm)  long.&nbsp;  These teeth weigh  about  2
pounds (900 g)  each.&nbsp;  The lower jaw is about 16 feet (5 m)   long
and  has  about  50-60  teeth in it.&nbsp;  When the  whale's  mouth  is
closed, the teeth fit into sockets in the upper jaw.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  bonds between the members of sperm whale pods are strong  and
long-lasting.&nbsp;  The members of a pod protect the young,   the  sick
and  the  injured. &nbsp; Groups of females with their young are common.&nbsp;
This  group structure allows a mother to dive very deeply to  hunt
while  leaving her young calf,  who is unable to dive very deeply,
at the surface and protected by the pod.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales are the deepest diving whales.&nbsp;  Although  they
live  at the surface they dive to hunt giant squid that are bottom
dwellers. &nbsp; They have been known to dive as deeply as  10,500  feet
(3,200 m),  but average dives are about 4,000 feet (1,200 m) deep.&nbsp;
The Sperm whale can hold its breath for about an hour.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whales breathe air at the surface of the  water
through a single,  s-shaped blowhole.&nbsp;  The blowhole is located  on
the left side of the front if its huge head.&nbsp;  They spout (breathe)
3-5 times per minute at rest,  but the rate increases to 6-7 times
per minute after a dive.&nbsp;  The blow is a noisy,  single stream that
rises  up  to 50 feet (15 m)  above the surface of the  water  and
points forward and to the left of the whale at a 45° angle.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Logging is when a whale lies still at the surface  of  the
water,   resting,   with its tail hanging  down.&nbsp;   While  floating
motionless,  part of the head, the dorsal fin or parts of the back
are  exposed at the surface.&nbsp;  Sperm whales are often seen  logging
and are relatively easy to approach in this state.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales also stick their tail out  of  the  water
into  the air,  swing it around,  and then slap it on the  water's
surface;  this is called lobtailing.&nbsp;  It makes a very loud  sound.&nbsp;
The  meaning or purpose of lobtailing is unknown,  but may be done
as  a  warning  to the rest of the pod or as some  other  type  of
communication.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales use echolocation to catch their prey  in
the  dark  oceanic depths.&nbsp;  Mothers also use it it keep  track  of
their young calf when they are diving to hunt;  a calf cannot dive
very  deeply  because it has to breathe much more frequently  than
the mother does.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm  whales are found in many  open  oceans,   both  in
tropical and cool waters.&nbsp;  Sperm whales live at the surface of the
ocean but dive very deeply to catch the giant squid.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sperm whale swims leisurely at the surface at about  3-9
mph (4.8-14.4 kph).&nbsp;  They can sustain a faster pace,  when fleeing
danger, of 21-27 mph (34-43 kph) for up to an hour.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whale breeding is not very  dependent  on  the
seasons. &nbsp; The gestation period is over 16 months and the  calf  is
born  tail  first  near  the surface of the  water. &nbsp;  The  newborn
instinctively  swims  to the surface within  10  seconds  for  its
first  breath;  it is helped by its mother.&nbsp;  Within 30 minutes  of
its  birth the baby whale can swim.&nbsp;  The newborn calf is about  13
feet  (4 m)  long and weighs about 1 ton (0.9 tonnes).&nbsp;  Twins  are
extremely rare (about 1% of births);  there is almost  always  one
calf. &nbsp;  The interval between births is about 3-4 years.&nbsp;  A  female
reaches  maturity  at 9-10 years (males reach  maturity  at  18-19
years)  and lives to be about 40 years old. &nbsp; On average,  a female
will  give birth to about 7-10 calves.&nbsp;  Frequently,  other  whales
"assist"  in  the birth.&nbsp;  The baby is nurtured with  its  mother's
milk  and is weaned in about 2 years. &nbsp; Calves drink 45 pounds  (20
kg) of milk each day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sperm whales have a life expectancy of over 70 years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that there  are  about  200,000
sperm  whales  world-wide. &nbsp;   Sperm   whales   are  considered  an
endangered  species. &nbsp; These whales (and many other  large  whales)
were over-hunted for many years,  since their meat, oil, and other
body  parts are very valuable.&nbsp;  Since whale hunting has  decreased
in  the  last  few  decades,  their populations  are  starting  to
recover.</P>
