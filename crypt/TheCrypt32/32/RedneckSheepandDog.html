<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A redneck, a sheep, and a dog were survivors of a terrible
shipwreck.&nbsp; They found themselves stranded on a desert island.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After being there a while, they got into the habit of going to
the beach every evening to watch the sun set.&nbsp; One particular
evening, the sky was a fiery red with beautiful cirrus clouds,
the breeze was warm and gentle; a perfect night for romance.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better
to the redneck.&nbsp; Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his
arm around it.&nbsp; But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely
until the redneck took his arm from around the sheep.&nbsp; After
that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together,
but there was no more cuddling.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few weeks passed by and, lo and behold, there was another
shipwreck.&nbsp; The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the
most beautiful woman the redneck had ever seen.&nbsp; She was in a
pretty bad way when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed
her back to health.&nbsp; When the young maiden was well enough,
they introduced her to their evening beach ritual.&nbsp; It was
another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and
gentle breeze; perfect for a night of romance.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pretty soon, the redneck started to get "<B>those feelings</B>" again.&nbsp;
He fought them as long as he could, but he finally gave in
and leaned over to the young woman, cautiously, and whispered
in her ear... </P>
