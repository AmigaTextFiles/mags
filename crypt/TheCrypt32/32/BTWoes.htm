<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I have a campaign to get broadband into our area, I was thinking about 
  BT.</p>
<p>Now, my feelings towards BT are coloured by my experience with them. I have 
  used BT as an ISP, as a telephone provider and now helping them. Helping them 
  is actually what campaigners are doing; they are acting as unpaid salesmen/women 
  for the company. To pretend otherwise is rather shallow, IMHO.</p>
<p>I no longer use BT as my call provider; there are a few reasons for this. It 
  is cheaper to use someone else for my calls because of the nature of my family’s 
  phone usage. Another reason is the fact that they, so far, haven’t upgraded 
  our exchange. I don’t see why I should give them any more money than I have 
  to while this continues. I have also found, in my experience, that BT were really 
  crap at providing any sort of backup when my line went tits up. Their call staff 
  is generally treated like mushrooms and spout the most awful drivel when you 
  present them with any question that isn’t on their list of prepared responses……….</p>
<p>I no longer use BT as my ISP, simply because, at the time, they increased charges 
  practically every time it suited them. They also changed the terms and conditions, 
  they started capping users with time limits (and still do), and this is aside 
  from the fact that I could hardly get a decent connection at night……….. So they 
  got binned for those reasons. </p>
<p>I have now read that BT has lost over two million users in the last year, you 
  could almost feel sorry for them. I said “almost”, but I manfully resist the 
  desire……</p>
<p>BT is reaping what it has sewn. They have treated their customers with absolute 
  disdain. Customers are not given any facts that might be helpful to <span class=GramE>them,</span> 
  they are used as a commodity simply because, in most cases, they have a monopoly 
  in the area. </p>
  <p>When this changes, they fall over themselves to try and prevent anyone else 
    from getting a foothold.</p>
<p>This appears to be changing! </p>
<p>BT is now getting hard pressed on the telecom front. OFTEL has slowly ground 
  them into a position where they can’t strangle the competition and are losing 
  ground faster and faster as people realise that they can save money easily and 
  quickly simply by changing provider.</p>
<p>They have also alienated a large amount of the population by their stance on 
  ADSL rollout. <span class=GramE>Lets</span> not forget that BT stopped the rollout, 
  and were faced with a very large backlash of bad publicity. They then came up 
  with their super wheeze of registration campaigns… which has also backfired 
  spectacularly. They announced the registrations believing that most folk wouldn’t 
  <span class=GramE>bother,</span> too low a take-up they claimed. Sorry, but 
  now they are trying to claim credit for all the campaigns that have reached 
  triggers. The triggers were huge at the start………750, I ask <span class=GramE>you 
  !!!</span></p>
<p>And that’s without mentioning <span class=GramE>their own</span> goal of Midband. 
  Ok, I’ll mention Midband…  First of all, to relieve the pressure on their failure 
  to roll out broadband, they promised a “new” service that would have always 
  on email, give 128k, be available to 90% of the population when it was launched 
  and would be a cheap alternative to ADSL.</p>
<p>Instead people were offered a tarted up <st1:Street><st1:address>Home Highway</st1:address></st1:Street> 
  connection pegged at 150 hours (at 64k) or 75 hours (at 128k) per month!!!! 
  Cheaper……………well, you got two phone lines, and line rental is included, but 
  £35 a month??? Taking the line rental off, it is only £13 a month (which is 
  cheaper than their dialup), but if you only wanted one line, it meant you were 
  paying £25 for a sub standard connection that wasn’t always on (they failed 
  at that bit) and was capped at a ludicrous level.</p>
<p>A larger installation fee than broadband and a years contract… A fiasco…</p>
<p>While other providers were claiming that 50 users would make an exchange viable, 
  BT were claiming that exchanges cost 500k to upgrade, and up to a million for 
  some.</p>
<p>They have slowly changed direction and have cut trigger levels, especially 
  after it looked that some other providers were going to move in. The easiest 
  way to get an exchange upgraded was to get a cable company to say it was moving 
  into your area.</p>
<p>But, as I say, I am now a campaigner for BT. <span
class=GramE>So</span>, have I suddenly lost all my morals?</p>
  <p>Well, in a manner of speaking, I have. I am prepared to play their game to 
    try and get broadband for my area. They are the best option so far. However, 
    I have equally no qualms in saying that I would not recommend BT to anyone 
    that signs up for my campaign. I will point them to a source of information 
    on ISP’s and let them draw their own conclusions. I also point out how to 
    change phone providers at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that BT should be stripped of the network. The network was 
  originally built using taxpayer’s money, and I very much doubt that they have 
  changed every last part of it. This is one of the reasons that they are claiming 
  that some exchanges are “unviable”. If they had invested in all their exchanges, 
  it would not take as much work to upgrade them to ADSL, for instance.</p>
<p><span class=GramE>So, at present, I’m happy to go along with them, but only 
  until they enable my exchange.</span> Of course, if they fail at that hurdle, 
  I will do everything in my power to bring them as much bad publicity as I can 
  muster and try and drive as much business away from them as I can. The nice 
  part is that, there are more than a few others who feel the same way. As I said, 
  you could almost feel sorry for them.</p>
  <p>BT <span class=GramE>are</span> now between a rock and a hard place, the 
    users are deserting them due to their stance and they do seem to have changed 
    their mind about their direction. So, <span class=GramE>its</span> a no win 
    situation. If they do decide to go all out to help their customers, the customers 
    probably won’t come back for a while, but if they don’t, the publicity will 
    ensure that the process of losing customers will keep accelerating. Either 
    way, things are getting tighter at BT……..</p>
