<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well  I  wish  I could tell you that there <B>IS</B> a magic  formula  to
allow  you  to "Buy and sell at a Profit". &nbsp; However to be  honest,
The solution is simple,  Buy cheap and sell expensive.&nbsp;  To do this
you need to know the market you intend dealing in.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lets  take a very simple way of making a little extra money.&nbsp;  Does
you  local  Newspaper have a column that allows you  to  advertise
Items  for sale.&nbsp;  Some newspapers allow this up to a certain  limit
(£100) and you pay no or little advertising costs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  lets  say you go to an Auction and buy a good condition,   But
second-hand Lawn Mower for £6.00&nbsp; (This is not a figure plucked  out
of the air,  this is the actual price I paid for mine only 3 month
ago).&nbsp;  You could then advertise this for sale, in your local paper , for  <B>£20
ONO.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>OR</B> ...Buy a Television at Auction&nbsp; (A colour Portable with teletext
and remote control should set you back around £10-£15).&nbsp;  Advertise
it for sale in the Newspaper for <B>£30 ONO</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Total outlay £16.00 ... Total income £50 ... Profit £34</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Easy  or  what?&nbsp; However this is dealing with Household objects  as
opposed to Antiques or Collectables,  But in reality the system is
the same.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are interested in buying and selling collectables, then you
have  the  worlds greatest information source  at  hand  ...   The
Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lets  take  an  example  ...Say you are interested  in  Collectable
ceramics from the Royal Worcester factory.&nbsp; You arrive in the sale
room on Viewing day and spot a piece, You inspect it and are happy
with its condition, The catalogue estimate is £20 -£30.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Write down all the details you can regarding the figure, Name -
Maker - Designer etc.&nbsp; Then upon returning home Check Ebay to see
what sort of price similar objects are fetching, You might be
mildly surprised, The piece you inspected could fetch up to £50-
£70 by selling it over the Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now if you are confident that You can sell this Piece online for
at least £50 (You would make this your reserve price), Now all you
have to do is bid at Auction, However if you want to make a
profit, You have to ensure you bid no higher that £30.&nbsp; Learn your
limit and stick to it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why sell over the Internet?&nbsp; Well experience has shown me that
certain items that are not judged collectable in the UK, are
however highly sought after in other countries like America or
Australia.&nbsp; This means that you can buy it in this country and sell
it abroad, Buyer pays the Postage cost plus insurance, You make a
healthy profit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Want  an example?</B> :- Some time ago at auction I spotted  a  box  of
misc crockery priced at £10-£15.&nbsp; This box contained
various pieces of Crockery including a Myott Coffee Pot, Two Myott
oval platters, and a badly chipped Copland Spode Vase.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Myott pieces are transfer printed with Hunting scenes,
unfashionable in the UK but collectable abroad.&nbsp; The  Copeland spode Vase was
beautiful but badly damaged.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At auction I bought the complete box of ceramics for £6.00.&nbsp; I sold
the  Myott coffee pot for £24 +P&P. &nbsp; The Two Myott Plates for  £10
each  +P&P  and  after doing some research on the  Copeland  Spode
vase,  I realised that it was early Nineteenth century and even in
its chipped and crazed condition sold for £12.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Paid £6.00... Sold £56.00 ..Profit £50.00</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But ... What about all the other pieces in the Box, Worth nothing,
what do you do with them.&nbsp; Well if you can't find a use for them
yourself&nbsp; (Under flower pots etc.),&nbsp; Then store them all away
somewhere until you have a sizeable collection, Then one weekend
take them all to a Car Boot sale and sell them off at 50p each.&nbsp;
You will be surprised how many people will actually buy them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Truth be known,&nbsp; Making money by buying and selling at auction is
reasonably easy, however it does take time and you must be
prepared to be patient and wait for the right buyer to come along.</P>
