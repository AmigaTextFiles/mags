 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each <B>Crashmate®</B> kit contains everything you need to take an accurate record of an accident.&nbsp; Take photographic evidence with the single use camera with flash.&nbsp; Get your own copy of the other driver's account with the Third Party Information form.&nbsp; Witness and Police Information forms can give you vital back-up of your account.&nbsp; Take comprehensive notes with pre-drawn road layouts, and even measure skid marks or scratches with the tape measure.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it's not just your insurance you have to worry about.&nbsp; They say where there's blame, there's a claim, and you need to make sure it isn't against you.&nbsp; If it's not your fault, make sure you can prove it, and avoid being hit with dodgy compensation claims.&nbsp; Even better, prove it's the other driver's fault and get some compo of your own.</P>
