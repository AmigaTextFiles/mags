<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Boooooring.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing ever seems to happen around here. &nbsp; Unless you 
consider two-year-old Little Lady screaming <B>"I want to do it 
myself"</B> for an hour this morning "something".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A quick look at the news tells me how much is happening 
everywhere else. &nbsp; Just look at these headlines.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Fresh violence rocks Kashmir</B>"&nbsp; Imagine the thrill of 
idealistically battling for human freedom against the Indian 
tyrants.&nbsp;  No,&nbsp; make that the Pakistani tyrants.&nbsp;  No, that would be 
the Indian tyrants.&nbsp;  Wait a minute ... which tyrants are the good 
guys in this skirmish?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Typhoon hits south China</B>"&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp;  Picture battling a typhoon, 
testing one's mettle against the ravages of Mother Nature, 
fending off torrent after torrent of pounding water, fighting 
just to keep one's footing and not be washed away into the gaping 
sea.&nbsp; Oh the suspense is pure agony.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>North China Flood Death Toll Reaches 38</B>"&nbsp; Feel the thrill of 
negotiating the flooded landscape, keeping afloat, scavenging for 
food, battling pillagers, rescuing stranded villagers, praying 
just to survive one more day.&nbsp;  The excitement is almost too much.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Rain delays US Open</B>"&nbsp; Imagine battling the worst "persistent 
drizzle" Mother Nature can send your way, thrown into the 
uncertain company of fellow celebrities, bravely escaping the 
risk of playing a slippery court ... forced against your very 
will to wait for the rain to stop, armed with nothing more than a 
tennis racket.&nbsp;  Now, that's adventure!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Cruise Ship Struck by Virus</B>"&nbsp; Imagine being one of the valiant 
300 germ-fighters to heroically battle acute gastroenteritis 
while crossing the unforgiving ocean in nothing more than a mere 
70,000 ton cruise ship. &nbsp; The only viruses I battle have names 
like "Klez" and "SoBig" and "Blaster".  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The valiant knights of open-sea food poisoning faced combat in 
Denmark, England, Ireland, Iceland and New York.&nbsp;  <B>Sa-ay</B>... New 
York is close to me.&nbsp;  But I'm still stuck battling computer 
viruses at my keyboard in Chesterville.&nbsp;  Far from where all the 
exciting headlines happen. &nbsp; Like in Iraq.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iraqis have been able to battle a real tyrant for decades. &nbsp; They 
have had the chance to evade torture chambers and persecution. &nbsp; 
They have been given the chance to survive famine and disease.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then came that once-in-a-lifetime moment of glory, when they rose 
to the occasion to dodge bombs and missiles sent by invading 
liberators.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a few more years of combat against hunger and disease, 
tyranny and violence, they rose to that once-in-a-lifetime chance 
again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alas, all good things must come to an end.&nbsp; Liberation, even with 
a missing tyrant snickering somewhere on the loose, means the end 
of torture, famine and persecution. &nbsp; It means peace.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all Iraqis are taking peace lying down.&nbsp; Some are even willing 
to resort to violence to protest against peace.&nbsp; So once again, 
Iraqis have the golden opportunity to valiantly dodge bombs and 
bravely evade persecution.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, Little Lady woke up in the middle of the night.&nbsp;  She 
did not want to go back to sleep in her room because "there are 
monsters and doctors." &nbsp; Of course, the only monster she knows is 
Cookie Monster. &nbsp; On the other hand, doctors can really be scary.&nbsp;  
Especially when they give you needles.&nbsp;  Particularly when you are 
just two years old.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Hmm</B>. &nbsp; Maybe boredom isn't so bad, after all.&nbsp;  Call me an 
underachiever, but somehow I get the feeling I stand a better 
chance against "monsters and doctors" than I do against the evil 
tyrants, typhoons, bombs and even life-threatening tennis-match 
delays.</P>

Did you ever hear that old Chinese curse:&nbsp; <B>"May you live in 
interesting times"?</B> &nbsp; Well let me wish you this:&nbsp; <B>"May boredom fill 
your days."</B>
