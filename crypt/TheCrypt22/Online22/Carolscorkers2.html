      baby at the age of 65.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  she was discharged from hospital , her relatives came to visit.
      "Can we see the baby?" they asked.  "Not yet , " said the 65 year old
      mother.   Twenty  minutes later, they asked again .  " Can we see the
      baby?" "Not yet , " said the mother.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Another  twenty  minutes  later , they asked again.  " Can we see the
      baby?" " Not yet ," said the mother.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Growing very impatient , they said.  " Well, when can we see the baby
      then ?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> " When it cries."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Why do we have to wait until the baby cries? "</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Because I forgot where I put it."</P>

<P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  depressed young Paisley woman was so desperate that she decided to
      end  her life by throwing herself into the Clyde.  When she went down
      the  docks a handsome young sailor noticed her tears and took pity on
      her.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Look,  you've got a lot to live for, " he said.  "I'm off to America
      in  the  morning,  and  if  you like, I can stow you away on my ship.
      I'll  take  good  care  of  you and bring you food every day." Moving
      closer,  he slipped his arm around her shoulder and added, "I'll keep
      you happy, and you'll keep me happy.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"The girl nodded.  After all, what did she have to lose?  That night,
      the  sailor  brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat.  From then
      on,  every night he brought her three sandwiches and a piece of fruit
      and they made passionate love until dawn.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Three  weeks  later  during  a routine search, the captain discovered
      her.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "What are you doing here?" the captain asked.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I  have  an  arrangement  with  one  of the sailors", she explained.
      "He's taking me to America, and he's feeding me."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "What are you doing for him?" said the captain.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"He's screwing me" said the girl.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "He certainly is," replied the captain. "This is the Govan ferry"</P>
