<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  woman  walked  into  the kitchen to find her  husband  stalking
      around wtih a flyswatter.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"What are you doing?" She asked.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Hunting flies." he responded.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Oh, Killing any?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yep, 3 males, 2 Females."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Intrigued, she asked. "How can you tell?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"3 were on a beer can, 2 were on the phone," he replied.</P>

                                 <CENTER>Another gem!</CENTER>
<P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The woman entered the room,  and with a knowing smile teasing  her
      full  lips,  she sank into the comfort of the plush chair  in  the
      corner.  The handsome stranger turned, having sensed her approach.
      Locking his steely gray eyes on hers,  he moved slowly toward her,
      his experienced gaze measuring her,  hypnotizing her with his soft
      murmurs of assurance.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  sank  to  his  knees before her and without a word,   smoothly
      released  her  from  her  constraining attire.   With  a  sigh  of
      surrender,   she  allowed his foreign hands to  unleash  her  bare
      flesh.  He expertly guided her through this tender, new territory,
      boldly taking her to heights she had never dared to dream of,  his
      movements  deliberate,  confident in his ability  to  satisfy  her
      every need.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Her senses swam.  She was overcome with an aching desire that  had
      gone unfulfilled for so long.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And,   just  as it seemed that ecstasy was within her  grasp,   he
      paused,  and for one heart-stopping moment, she thought, "It's too
      big!  - it will never fit!" Then, with a sudden rush, it slid into
      place  as  if  it  had been made only for her.   As  pleasure  and
      contentment washed over her,  she met his steady gaze,   tears  of
      gratitude  shining in her eyes.  And he knew it wouldn't  be  long
      before she returned.  Oh,  yes,  this woman would want more.   She
      would want to do it again and again and again............</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> There  was a sensitive man with a bald head and a wooden  leg  who
      got invited to a Halloween party.  He didn't know what costume  to
      wear  to  hide his head and his leg so he wrote to a fancy costume
      company to explain the problem.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A  few days later,  he received a parcel with a note:  "Dear  Sir,
      please  find enclosed a pirate's outfit.  The spotted handkerchief
      will cover your bald head,  and with your wooden leg,  you will be
      just right as a pirate."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  man  thought  this  was   terrible   because  they  had  just
      emphasized his wooden leg.  He wrote a rude letter of complaint. A
      week  passed and he received another parcel and a note which said:
      "Dear  Sir,   sorry about before,  please find enclosed  a  monk's
      habit.   The long robe will cover your wooden leg,  and with  your
      bald head, you will really look the part."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  the  man  was  really  annoyed,  since  they  had  gone  from
      emphasizing  his wooden leg to emphasizing his  bald  head,and  he
      wrote the company a REALLY rude letter of complaint.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  couple  of  days later he received a small parcel  and  a  note
      which  read:  "Dear Sir,  please find enclosed a jar  of  caramel.
      Pour  the  jar of caramel over your bald head,  stick your  wooden
      leg up your ass and go as a toffee apple!"</P>

      off  to work the next day without talking to her,  but she doesn't
      care.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> She's  busy doing her thing around the house.  All of the  sudden,
      around 1:00 in the afternoon,  the doorbell rings. She goes to the
      door  and  opens  it and there is a young delivery  guy  from  the
      local  florist shop with an enormous,  beautiful bouquet of  long-
      stemmed red roses... the expensive ones... from her husband.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She says to the delivery guy with disgust, "Oh CRAP!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  delivery  guy says,  "What's a matter lady?  You  don't  like
      roses?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She  replies,  "Yeah,  I like roses,  but do you  know  what  this
      means?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">He says, "No, Lady, what does this mean?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She  answers,  "It means for the next two weeks I'll be laying  on
      my back with my legs in the air."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He replies, "Geez, Lady, don't you have a vase?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A  husband  and wife were out golfing together one day  when  they
      came  upon a tough Par 4 hole.  The husband hooked his drive  deep
      into the woods and proclaimed that he would have to chip out.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the wife said,  "Maybe not,  dear!  Do you see that barn over
      there? If I open the doors on both sides,  I do believe you  could
      hit it right through and reach the green."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> So  the  husband agrees to give it a try,  but when  he  hits  the
      ball,  it goes straight through the first doors of the barn,  hits
      the  crossbeam,  ricochets back and hits his wife  square  in  the
      head, killing her stone dead.</P> 

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well,   about a year goes by and the man is golfing with a friend.
      He finds himself on the same hole,  with the same results:  a hook
      deep  into  the woods.  He is all set to chip out when his  friend
      runs up to him and says,  "Wait!  Do you see that barn over there?
      If  I  open the doors on both sides,  I think you can still  reach
      the green."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "No way," replies the man, "I tried that last year and got a 7."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A beautiful,  voluptuous woman went to a gynecologist.  The doctor
      took  one look at her,  and all his professionalism went  out  the
      window.   He  immediately  told her to  undress.   After  she  had
      disrobed, the doctor began to stroke her thigh.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Doing so, he asked her, "Do you know what I'm doing?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Yes,"  she  replied,   "you're  checking  for  any  abrasions  or
      dermatological abnormalities."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> "That is right," said the doctor.</P> 

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">He  then began to fondle her breasts.  "Do you know what I'm doing
      now?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yes,"  the woman said,  "you're checking for any lumps or  breast
      cancer."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Correct," replied the shady doctor.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Finally,   he  mounted  his  patient  and  started  having  sexual
      intercourse with her.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">He asked, "Do you know what I'm doing now?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Yes," she said.  "You're getting herpes, which is why I came here

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Bartender is experienced and has learned not  to  ask  people
      about  the animals that people bring into the bar,  so he  doesn't
      mention the ducks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They  chat  for about 30 minutes before the bloke with  the  ducks
      has to go to the restroom. The ducks are left on the Bar.</P> 

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  The  bartender  is  alone with the ducks.   There  is  an  awkward
      silence.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The bartender decides to try make some conversation.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"What's your name?" he says to the first duck.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Huey," said the duck.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"How's your day been?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Great.  Lovely day.  Had a ball.  Been in and out of puddles  all
      day".</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Oh. That's nice." says the Bartender.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Then he says to the second duck, "Hi. And what's your name?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Dewey," came the answer.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "So how's your day been?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Great.  Lovely day.  Had a ball.  Been in and out of puddles  all
      day. If I had the chance another day I would do the same again."</P> 

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So the bartender turns to the third duck and says,  "So,  you must
      be Louie?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"No," growls the 3rd duck,  "My name is Puddles.  Don't ask  about
      my fucking day."</P>

      A long, long time ago... I can still remember how
      Computers used to make me smile.
      And I knew if I had my chance,
      That I could make electrons dance,
      And maybe I'd be happy for a while.

      But January made me shiver,
      it chilled me deep down in my liver,
      Bad news I'd collected...
      I couldn't get connected.

      I can't remember back that day
      When I first learned of Y2K
      But something touched me anyway,
      The day computers died.

      So, ...Bye, bye to the next digit of Pi
      Ran my PC on some DC but the voltage was dry
      And good ol' boys were sending e-mail replies
      Saying this will be the day I retire
      this will be the day I retire

      Can you write in C plus plus ?
      And do you have faith in your local bus
      If the driver tells you so ?
      Do you believe in Compaq's goals
      Can software save your mortal soul
      And can you teach me how to type real slow ?

      Well I thought that you were prepared
      'Cause your memo said you weren't impaired
      Your stationery's swell
      But you can go to hell

      I was a lonely teenage Unix hack
      With an incantation and a modem jack
      but I knew the cat had left the sack
      The day computers died I started singin'...

      Bye, bye to the next digit of Pi
      Ran my PC on some DC but the voltage was dry
      And good ol' boys were sending e-mail replies
      Saying this will be the day I retire
      this will be the day I retire

      Now for 10 years we've ignored the threat
      And we haven't solved the problem yet
      But that's not how it used to be

      When the luddites read for the king and queen
      with a light they filled with kerosene
      And some manuals they stole from you and me
      And while Bill Gates was looking pleased
      Time stole his monopolies
      The courtroom was adjourned
      No verdict was returned

      While Apple tried a color scheme
      The engineers returned to steam
      And we had purges of their dreams
      The day computers died We were singin'

      Bye, bye to the next digit of Pi
      Ran my PC on some DC but the voltage was dry
      And good ol' boys were sending e-mail replies
      Saying this will be the day I retire
      this will be the day I retire

      Intel inside in an iron smelter
      The food leftover from my fallout shelter
      Twinkies old and aging fast
      I'd rather eat the grass
      Q and A tried for a system crash
      With the tester on the sidelines in a cast
      Now the timeshare net was running Doom
      While mainframes played a marching tune
      We all tried to log in
      Oh, but we never could begin

      'Cause Cobol tried to take the field,
      And Holerith refused to yield.
      Do you recall what was revealed,
      The day computers died?

      We started singing Bye, bye to the next digit of Pi
      Ran my PC on some DC but the voltage was.....
