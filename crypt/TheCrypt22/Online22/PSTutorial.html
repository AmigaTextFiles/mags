      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">I  am often asked,  How do I make the Various Disk labels,  Either
      for the<font color=red> CRYPT<font color=yellow> Disk version or various other Projects.</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=yellow>

      <CENTER>Well the secret is Using that excellent program "Pagestream"</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pagestream is the only supported DTP<font color=white> (Desk Top Publishing)<font color=yellow> Program
      for  the  Amiga/Mac & PC. <font color=white> (I currently have Pagestream3  for  the
      Amiga and Pagestream4 for the PC)<font color=yellow>.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=white><font color=yellow><font color=white><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does a DTP program compare with a Wordprocesser? Well you have
      a  lot more features with a DTP program ...Want to create your own
      Printed Magazine/Newsletters etc.  Then Pagestream is the  Program
      for you.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  this  very simple tutorial ...I will show you in a  few  easy
      steps ...How to create your own Personlised Disk Label. If you can
      follow  this  then you can easily use Pagestream  to  Create  many
      other  Projects (Birthday Invitations/CD Covers/ Cassette Inserts/
      Business cards etc.)</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">Step1 :-<font color=aqua> Load up Pagestream -select a blank/new page.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">Step2  :-<font color=aqua>  Using the "Box" tool (7th icon down on  the  left  hand
      vertical tool bar) ..Draw a box 2¾ inches Square.<font color=lime>(SeePS1)</font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=lime>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step3 :-<font color=aqua> Click on the Top icon on the Vertical bar (Arrow pointing
      left/up)  then click on the box you drew ..This will activate  the
      Box (You should see the re-sizing handles.  Click in the centre of
      your box, Holding down the left mouse button, You can now move the
      Box around the Page to position it.</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  the Box still activated.  go to the Top menu bar and  click:
      OBJECTS/Line&fill ... Now in the Requester that has appeared click
      on "Line" and adjust the Weight to 2pts. Click OK ..and you should
      have a nice thick line around your box<font color=lime> (See PS1)</font></P><font color=lime>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Step4 :-<font color=aqua> Lets add some text.  Click on the 2nd button down on  the
      Vertical bar (Marked with an A)  then click anywhere on  the  Page
      and type in your text.</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">After typing your text "Click" to activate it,  Now you can resize
      the text and drag it into your Box to place it where you want.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If  you  want  to change the Font,  You can do this either  before
      writing  the Text of after you have completed it.  Just  click  on
      "Type" from the Top Menu bar and select Font.<font color=lime>(See PS2)</font></P><font color=lime>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Now  we want some text rotated ...So when the top of the label  is
      folded over the Disk the Text is the correct way up for reading.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again write out your text, using the desired font and activate it.
      Now  go  to the Top Menu Bar and select "Object/Rotate" using  the
      requestor box rotate your text 180 degrees ..Click OK.   You  text
      should  now be Up side Down,  So place it at the Top of your  Disk
      label<font color=lime> (see PS3)</font></P><font color=lime>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Step5  :- <font color=aqua> Inserting a Graphic ..Go to the  top  menu  bar  select
      "File/Place Graphic".</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> From  the Requestor select the Graphic you want,  Click  OK.   The
      graphic  will now load into Pagestream.  Resize it until  it  fits
      into  your  Label  (Note:- The graphic  will  show  little  or  no
      distortion from re-sizing with Pagestream even if the Graphic look
      large  when  first loaded it will still look OK when reduced.<font color=lime>(see
      PS4)</font></P><font color=lime>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Now  our  Disk  label is almost complete.  However this  is  where
      Pagestreams Power comes in.</P>


     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Click on the Outside box (First one we Drew)  to activate it.  NOW
      Holding  down the "Shift Key" Click on every picture or  piece  of
      text we used ...They should all be activated.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Go  to  the  Top menu bar and select "OBJECT/Group" Now  all  your
      various Graphics,  Boxes & text are one Object.  Try moving it. If
      anything is left behind ..Just upgroup and try again.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  finally  ...As we have a single object ...And you  will  want
      more  than  one  copy ....Press "d" on your keyboard  ..Pagestream
      will make an exact copy of the Object.  In fact you should  get  8
      labels from a single sheet of A4 paper.</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once  mastered the Above Tutorial can easily be adapted  to  allow
      you  to  easily create a great many things,  From a  Plain  simple
      Business card ..To a colourful Birthday Invitation.</P>
