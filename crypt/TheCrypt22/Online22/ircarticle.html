<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Talking  over  the internet has become
increasingly  popular  over the years,
not  only  because  it's easier to use
than  ever,  but  also because in most
cases  it's  cheaper  than  talking to
someone  over the phone, especially if
you   have   a  free  call  un-metered
internet   service  provider.   What's
more, you can even talk to people over
the  other side of the world!  With so
many  methods  of talking over the net
now, one of the most popular has to be
Internet Relay Chat, commonly referred
to as IRC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main reason why it's so popular is
due  to  the  fact  it  contains  more
features  than  any other chat clients
available,  like  ICQ.  But where does





your  Amiga  come  into  the equation?
Well  actually  it  has  the  best IRC
clients available, AmIRC (developed by
Vapor,   the  makers  of  Voyager  and
Microdot),   and  BlackIRC  (from  the
makers of FxPaint and FxScan), both of
which  are full of useful features and
easy to use.  These are the two little
gems we will be concentrating on.  :)</P>

          <font color=lime><H1><CENTER>HOW DOES IT WORK?</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically,   IRC   is   a  network  of
computers, otherwise known as servers,
which  are  connected  to  each  other
either  over  the  internet  or  via a
Local Area Network (LAN).  This can be
connected  to  with  IRC software, and
allow  you to chat to other people who
are  also connected to this network of
computers.  This network is split into
channels,  with  different  topics  of
conversation and groups.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  when  it comes down to the actual
conversations,  they  contain a lot of
abbreviations  and  expressions, which
are covered on the opposite page.</P>

           <font color=lime><H1><CENTER>GETTING STARTED</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In AmIRC:  Each time you first load up
AmIRC,  you  will  see the server list
window come up.  It contains a list of
servers,   as   well  as  channels  to
connect  to.  More importantly towards
the  top  of your window, you will see
where  your  nickname,  real name, and
user  name  can  be entered.  If AmIRC
has  been launched for the first time,
these boxes will be empty, so you will
need to fill these in.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  will notice there are three boxes
for  nicknames,  you need to put in at
least  one,  although  it is sometimes
handy   to  fill  in  the  second  and
possibly  the  third  one  as well, in
case  your  nickname may be already in
use  by  another  user  on the server.
The  nickname  is  the  most important
part  to  fill in, as the nickname you
choose  is  what  you will be known as
when  you  connect  to  IRC.   You can
always  change  your nick once you are
connected     by     typing     "/nick
newnickname",  where  "newnickname" is
where  you  put  a  nickname  of  your
choice.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next field is where you can put in
your   real  name.   It's  not  really
essential, but it can be handy so that
other  users  can  find  out  who  you
really  are  without  actually  asking
you.   You  never know, there might be
someone  in  the  channel  who already
knows you!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then  there's the user name box, which
may   be   shaded  out,  depending  on
whether you use Miami or Genesis.  The
IdentD  box  may  also  be shaded out.
IdentD  is software built in to AmIRC,
that   allows   an   IRC   server   to
authenticate the identity of a client.
This is disabled if an external IdentD
is running.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  tick  box below skips the message
of  the day (MOTD) on the server if it
is ticked.  The message of the day can
be pretty much anything.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below  the list are more fields, which
will  already be filled in if you have
a  server  selected.   The server name
field  shows  the  server  host of the
server   you  can  connect  to.   Then
there's  the  Port  number,  which  is
usually   6667.    The   password   is
optional,   but   very   few  channels
require  a  password.   The comment is
the  name  of the server.  And finally
is  the autojoin field, which is where
you can enter in the channels you want
to  join when you decide to connect to
the  IRC  server.   If you are feeling
adventurous  already,  you  can easily
enter in more than one channel to join
by entering the channel names with the
#  in  front  of each one, with commas
following  each  channel  name, but no
spaces.    Or   if   you  are  already
connected  and  on  a channel, you can
just  type "/join #channelname", where
#channelname  is  where you put in the
channel you want to join.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  your IRC server is not listed, you
can  easily add a group for the server
and  the  server  details  within  the
added group.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  you  are  ready  to  connect with
AmIRC,  just  highlight the server you
want to join, and click connect!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In   BlackIRC:   Believe  it  or  not,
considering  BlackIRC  is freeware, it
is  slightly  more complex than AmIRC.
Although  we  will only cover the most
used and important aspects.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  you first load up BlackIRC, like
AmIRC, you will be faced with a server
list,  and  is pretty much the same as
the  AmIRC one, except you are given a
different list of servers.  Again, you
can easily add servers and channels of
your own to the list.  Don't forget to
fill  in the details of your real name
and  chosen  nickname  if  it  is your
first time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike  AmIRC, BlackIRC has everything
in one window, but split into sections
with  tabs.   Once you have connected,
you   need  to  click  on  the  "Chat-
window" tab, which is where everything
happens.    And   you  are  away  with
BlackIRC!</P>

             <font color=lime><H1> <CENTER>WHAT NOW?</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ok,  now  we  are  connected  and have
joined  a channel, you can pretty much
sit  back  after  all that setting up!
:)  But  when  you first join, you may
well  be  greeted by other users, it's
always polite to say hi back to them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  you  are  probably looking at all
those buttons and other things on your
window  by now, and wondering what the
hell they do?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At  the top of your window (both AmIRC
and BlackIRC) you will see a long box,
usually with text in it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  is  where the topic goes for the
channel,  and  the conversation in the
channel doesn't necessarily have to be
related  to  the  topic.  Then next to
the  topic  you will see several small
buttons;  T, N, S, I, P, M.  There are
additional  buttons on AmIRC; L, K, B.
These  control  modes  for the channel
and  can  only  be  changed by channel
operators.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color=white>"T"<font color=aqua>  is  for Topic protection, if this
is  enabled only channel operators can
modify or change the topic.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color=white>"N"<font color=aqua>   stops   people   messaging  from
outside  a  channel,  although you can
still  message  users privately in the
channel.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <font color=white>  "S"<font color=aqua>  button  makes  the  channel
secret until it is joined by users.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I"<font color=aqua>  sets  the  channel to invite mode
only,  so  that  only users within the
channel can invite users in to join.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"P"<font color=aqua>  sets the channel mode to private,
this   means   that   the  channel  is
invisible  in the global channel list.
And...</font></P><font color=aqua>


<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"M" <font color=aqua>  sets   the   channel   mode   to
moderated,   so   that   only  channel
operators  and  users with "voice" can
communicate   into  the  channel.   In
AmIRC,</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"L"<font color=aqua>  controls the number of users that
can enter the channel, if active.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"K"<font color=aqua>  is  where  channel  operators can
password protect a channel by entering
in  the keyword required to enter then
channel if active.</font></P><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And <font color=white> "B"<font color=aqua>  shows a list of users banned
(if any) from the channel.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Down the right hand side of the window
is  the users list, which shows who is
currently  in the channel.  Some users
may  have what looks like an LED light
beside  their  nickname,  green  means
that  they  are a channel operator and
can  obviously  control  the  channel.
Users  with  voice have a yellow light
beside   their   nick,  which  doesn't
really  mean  anything,  except if the
channel  is moderated at any time they
can   continue  communicating  in  the
channel.  However on Black IRC this is
different,  channel  operators  have a
"@"  beside their nick, and users with
voice   have   a   "+"   beside  their
nickname.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Below  the  user  list  are  the  user
command  buttons.   The  most commonly
used   buttons   include  the  "Query"
button.  When you click once on a nick
and click on the query button, another
window/page appears where you can talk
to that selected user in private.  You
can  make  it  even  more  private  by
clicking  on  the "DCC Chat" button in
the  query window/page, or highlight a
nick  and  click  the "Chat" button in
the main IRC window (if you don't have
a  query window/page open already) and
you  can  now  have a direct client to
client conversation (hence DCC), while
experiencing  less server lag.  Lag is
a term often used in the IRC world, it
means  that the connection between you
and the server is delayed.  AmIRC will
tell  you  when  you  are experiencing
server  lag  with  a  flashing red bar
below  the  user  list,  and will also
tell you in the main dialogue box.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And   of  course  finally,  below  the
dialogue  box is a long box (identical
to  the topic one) where you can enter
your  text  and communicate with other
users  in  the  channel.   You do this
simply   by  entering  your  text  and
pressing enter/return.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And  that's  the  basics of IRC!  Here
are      some     useful     commands,
abbreviations  and  URL's, so that you
can   make   the   most  of  your  IRC
sessions.</P>
