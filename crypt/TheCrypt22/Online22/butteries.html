      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comparison between Aberdeen Rolls and French Croissants, at least
      in  terms  of  texture  if  not  appearance, has been made by several
      people.   It  has  been  suggested  that  rolls and croissants have a
      common ancestry that dates back to the end of the seventeenth century
      in Budapest after the defeat of the Turks.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It's  unclear  as to when rolls were first made in Scotland but where
      ever  they  came  from  they  have  subsequently  became  an Aberdeen
      speciality.   If  you  visit  the Northeast of Scotland you will find
      Aberdeen  Rolls  on sale in every bakery, corner shop and supermarket
      and if you taste them you will be hooked forever.  The names Aberdeen
      rolls,  Butteries and Rowies are interchangeable so take your pick or
      even use them all, you'll be understood what ever you call them.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rolls  are  roundish,  about  10cm  across and slightly higher in the
      centre  than  at the edges.  They are golden to dark brown in colour,
      can  be  either crispy or soft but must be slightly salty.  They also
      have  a very high fat content which is largely butter (hence the name
      buttery)  with  some  lard.   Recently  a vegetarian version has been
      introduced with the butter and lard being replaced by vegetable fats.</P>

<P>
                   <CENTER> <I>These qualities will make about 16 rolls.</I></CENTER>
<P>
      <CENTER>1 lb. of plain flour.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 6 oz. butter.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>4 oz. lard. 1 heaped teaspoon of salt.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 2 heaped teaspoons of sugar.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> ½ oz. fresh yeast.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>¼ pint of tepid water.</CENTER>
<P>
      <CENTER><B>Directions</B></CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike  pastry,  which has to be made using cold kitchen tools, yeast
      breads  ought  to be made under warm conditions to allow the yeast to
      raise the dough, hence make rolls under warm conditions.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sieve  the  flour  and  salt  into  a  large bowl and set aside for a
      moment.  Cream the fresh yeast, sugar and a little of the tepid water
      together  and add to the bowl of flour.  Mix the ingredients together
      with enough water to make a smooth firm dough.</P>


     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Transfer the dough to a well floured surface and knead well for about
      five  minutes.  Place the dough back into the bowl, cover with a warm
      slightly  damp  cloth and set aside in a warm place for about an hour
      to allow the yeast do its work of expanding the dough to about double
      its  original  size.   While  the  dough is rising cream together the
      butter and lard in readiness for the next step.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  the  dough  has  risen knead it again and then roll it out on a
      floured  surface  and  then spread it with a third of the butter\lard
      mixture and sprinkle lightly with flour.  Fold the dough in three and
      roll  it  out  again.  Repeat the procedure twice more.  Roll out the
      dough  quite  thinly and cut into squares.  Bring the four corners of
      each  square  to  the  centre,  shape  them  into  rounds and flatten
      slightly  with  hand  -  do  not  over  handle  the dough.  Place the
      uncooked  rolls onto a floured and warm baking tray and leave them in
      a  warm place to rise for about half an hour to 40 minutes.  Bake the
      rolls  in  a  hot  oven  (200°C/ 400°F) for about 15-20 minutes until
      golden brown and crispy on both sides.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  rolls can be eaten warm (absolutely fabulous) or set aside until
      they  are  cool  and  stored.  Rolls can be made in a large batch and
      subsequently  frozen  for  later  use.   If defrosting the rolls in a
      microwave  oven do not over heat otherwise the rolls will become limp
      and the fat content will become over-heated and sizzle.</P>



     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Aberdeen  rolls  can  be eaten dry (without anything spread on them),
      spread  with  butter  (just  in case you really hanker after an early
      coronary,  even  if  the rolls do then taste splendid) or spread with
      jam etc.</P></font></font>
