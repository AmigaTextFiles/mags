      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The tech. asked her if she was "running it under Windows."</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The woman then responded, "No, my desk is next to the door.  But that
      is  a good point.  The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under
      a window, and his is working fine."</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Tech.   Support:   "How  much  free  space  do  you have on your hard
      drive?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Customer:  "Well, my wife likes to get up there on that Internet, and
      she downloaded ten hours of free space.  Is that enough?"</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Overheard in a computer shop:</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Customer: "I'd like a mouse mat, please."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Salesperson: "Certainly sir, we've got a large variety."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Customer: "But will they be compatible with my computer?"</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  once  received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document
      back  to the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to
      keep it.</P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  work  for  a local ISP.  Frequently we receive phone calls that go
      something like this:  Customer:  "Hi.  Is this the Internet?"</P>

                                   <font color=white><CENTER>-----------</CENTER>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Tech.   Support:  "OK Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at
      the  same  time.   That  brings  up  a task list in the middle of the
      screen.  Now type the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Customer: "I don't have a 'P'."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Tech. Support: "On your keyboard, Bob."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Customer: "What do you mean?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Tech. Support: "'P' on your keyboard, Bob."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Customer: "I'm not going to do that!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Customer: "No, it didn't crash.......it crashed."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Tech. Support: "Huh?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Customer:   "I  crashed  my game.  That's what I said before.  Now it
      doesn't work."</P>
