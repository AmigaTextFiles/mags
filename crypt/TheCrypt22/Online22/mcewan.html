      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Greetings to the Global Amiga family,</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes,  I know that it has been more than a week,  and yes the  deal
      is still on,  and yes we are moving very quickly as I will outline
      to you all below</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  want  to personally thank our friends and families for sticking
      with us and with our dreams as they are coming to reality.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As  Amiga has matured over the last two years,  and our plans only
      slightly changed I would like to say thank you to each  and  every
      one of you for your patience and excitement as we move forward.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1999 Amiga,  Inc.  decided to take a very different road  than
      the  ones previously charted for the community.  It was  met,   by
      some,   with disbelief,  most with excitement as a path was  being
      laid  towards a future where digital content would be accessed  by
      any digital device.  Amiga selected an unknown partner in the Tao-
      Group of Reading England,  and I can assure you that this was  the
      best decision we have made.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tao  and Amiga have never been closer as a true partnership is  in
      place.   I want to thank Francis Charig my dear friend,   and  the
      rest  of  the Tao team as they been instrumental to the  successes
      that will become public knowledge soon.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However  with all of the great plans that were in  place  and  the
      product development that had started there was still the issue  of
      having funds necessary to make it all happen,  and the addition of
      Frank Wilde as our Chairman has been amazing help,  and I can  say
      we  are  moving forward in ways that are going to bring  Amiga  to
      new  levels,  and I could not be more happy with the results  that
      we are seeing.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Thank  you  to  everyone  of you who are  keeping  the  faith  and
      spreading the truth about Amiga.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  have  several announcements that are happening here,   and  you
      need  to  know  that we are definitely going to  have  more  Amiga
      enabled products ship in 2002 than in any year previous.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our STB partner - Nokia,  and their new Media Terminal.  Yes,  the
      same  Nokia  that you all know and love.  Amiga will be pre-loaded
      on  these  products  and  we will begin shipping  on  them  before
      summer  this year.  Now the Nokia announcement will be  coming  on
      their  site  in  the  coming weeks,  but we are  going  ahead  and
      putting  our release up,  and then we will follow on with  another
      joint announcement.  I often get messages asking when we are going
      to let the rest of the world know what is happening.  Well for all
      of  you  who  have  asked - Amiga will be at the Embedded  Systems
      Show in San Francisco,  CA,  March 12 through the 15th. We will be
      in  booth #1602,  located in the South Hall of Moscone Center.  We
      will  be showing the new Amiga technology,  and some exciting  new
      features never before seen in any other product.  We will also  be
      making  at least one announcement there at the show.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  have two more new members added to the team and there are many
      more  that will be announced soon.  The first two are part of  our
      sales team.  Both are dynamic and excited to be part of the  Amiga
      family.  Liz Barnick and David Brott joined us in January, and are
      establishing themselves quickly with regards to new business,  and
      great  ideas.  I have included information about them  both  in  a
      separate document that is attached to this update.  AmigaOS 4.0 is
      moving  ahead  very nicely and I could not be  more  pleased  with
      Hyperion  and their ability to get things done.  We  will  all  be
      very proud of their efforts,  and I know that many of you will  be
      rewarded with what they have already accomplished,  and  with  the
      product that they are building.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  can  assure  you  that your patience will  be  met  with  great
      rewards,  and there are many others who are now learning what  you
      have known.  That Amiga has the most robust,  talented,  dedicated
      community of any computing platform today or in the future.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Thank  you again for your continued prayers and support.  You  are
      about to be rewarded.</P>
