      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">This  is all about the  Doe Family - Brian,  Danora,  Christopher,
      and Michael - living and working in Misawa, Japan.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Misawa  is a small farming community located on the Pacific  coast
      on the northern part of the main island of Honshu.   It is located
      within the Aomori Prefecture.   The City of Aomori, located at the
      northernmost  tip of Honshu - about 140km NNW of Misawa,   is  the
      prefectural capitol;  and Hachinohe - about 20km SE of Misawa,  is
      the  regional  center.   Misawa's climate is moderately  warm  and
      humid  with  occasional rain during the  summer,   and  cold  with
      frequent snow - occasionally heavy - during the winter.   Misawa's
      prime  economy is centered around agriculture,  as well as support
      of  the  United  States military and the Japanese Air Self-Defense
      Force (JASDF) located at Misawa Air Base.</P>

<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brian  is  a 32 year old avionics technician in the United  States
      Navy.  He first enlisted in July 1987,  first being stationed with
      Strike  Fighter  Squadron   (VFA)    25   based  at  NAS  Lemoore,
      California.  While there,  he completed two 6-month deployments  -
      one  aboard  USS  Constellation (CV-64),   the  other  aboard  USS
      Independence  (CV-62),  where he participated in Operation  Desert
      Shield,  when Iraq invaded Kuwait.  He also did a short  stint  on
      the  USS Midway (CV-41).  Following his tour with VFA-25,  he took
      orders to the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department  (AIMD)
      at  NAS Fallon,  Nevada,  working in more intimate detail with the
      defective  "black boxes" that the aircraft squadrons  remove  from
      their aircraft.  While there,  he married his wife,  Danora,  whom
      he  met  while  in  Lemoore.  Following  his  three-year  tour  in
      Fallon,  he took orders to AIMD NAS Lemoore, where he did two more
      deployments,  one on USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), the other on USS Carl
      Vinson  (CVN-70).  He participated in Operation Southern Watch  in
      the  Arabian  Gulf  during  both deployments,   and  in  Operation
      Desert  Fox while on the Vinson.  He also did a couple of work-ups
      onboard  USS  Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72).  On  August  16th,   1999,
      prior  to  transferring  out of Lemoore,  Christopher  was  born. 
      After Lemoore,  Brian transferred to AIMD NAF Misawa, Japan, where
      he  worked  as  the  department's Automated Test Equipment  Branch
      Leading Petty Officer (LPO).  In March 2001,  Brian took  on  much
      larger  responsibilities as he was re-assigned to  the  department
      Quality  Assurance  division  as the Avionics  QA  Representative,
      where he works today.</P>



      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danora  is a 25 year old devoted mother and housewife.  A Hanford,
      California  native,  she married Brian just after graduating  from
      high  school.   She  very quickly learned  the  peculiarities  and
      quirks of a military lifestyle.  While in high school,  she was an
      active  participant  in  her school's Future  Farmers  of  America
      (FFA)   chapter,  raising and showing dairy cows  and  rabbits  at
      various  state and county fairs.  Her talent in this  area  netted
      her  several high-ranking awards for Best in Show,  among others. 
      Her agricultural talents currently on hiatus,  she plans to return
      to  her  agricultural roots after Brian retires from the military,
      passing  the  art down to her next generation.  In  the  meantime,
      she plans on attending college and working on her degree.</P>



     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Christopher  ,   age  2,   was born at Naval  Hospital,   Lemoore,
      California,  on August 16th, 1999.  Weighing in at six pounds nine
      ounces,   and measuring 19 inches at birth,  he has grown  like  a
      weed,   and developed nicely.  His current occupation is  to  keep
      his  parents on their toes,  as he has learned how to walk,   run,
      and  climb  (usually onto our dining room table),   and  make  his
      displeasure  very well known!  It will be just a  matter  of  time
      before  he  tries  to play a peanut butter sandwich  in  the  VCR.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Update:   This has been done.  Thankfully,  Brian is  quite  good
      with electronic repair!</P>



      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michael Anthony,  the newest member of the Doe Family, was born at
      Misawa Air Base Hospital,  Japan, on Tuesday, November 7th, 2000. 
      He weighed in at seven pounds one ounce,  and measured 19 inches. 
      At  less than a day old,  he was already more vocal than his older
      brother!  Michael has learned how to walk,  and has wasted no time
      at  all  in mastering the skill!  He also has an intense obsession
      with electrical cords,  and will usually have one unplugged within
      seconds  of  being  set  down on the floor  --  Christopher  walks
      behind  him  plugging back in whatever Michael unplugs.   Needless
      to say, their parents are always highly wired and on their toes!</P>
