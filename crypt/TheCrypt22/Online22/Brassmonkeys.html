     <font color=aqua> Did  you  know,  in  the  mighty  British  Navy at the time of Empire
      building,  every  sailing  ship had cannon (the plural of cannon) for
      protection.   Cannon of the times required round iron cannonballs.  A
      ship's master wanted to store the cannonballs such that they could be
      available for instant use when needed, but in a manner that would not
      let them roll around the gun deck.<P>
      
      The  solution  devised was to stack them up in a square-based pyramid
      next  to  the  cannon.   The top level of the stack had one ball, the
      next  level  down had three, the next had nine, the next had sixteen,
      and so on.  Four levels would provide a stack of 30 cannonballs.  The
      only  real  problem was how to keep the bottom level from sliding out
      from under the weight of the higher levels.  To do this, they devised
      a small brass plate referred to as a "brass monkey," with one rounded
      indentation for each cannonball in the bottom layer.

      Brass  was  used  because  the cannonballs wouldn't rust on the brass
      monkey, but would rust on an iron one.  When temperature falls, brass
      contracts  faster  than  iron.   As it got cold on the gun decks, the
      indentations  in  the  brass  monkey  would get smaller than the iron
      cannonballs  they  were holding.  If the temperature got cold enough,
      the  bottom  layer  of cannonballs would pop out of the indentations,
      spilling  the  entire  pyramid  over  the  deck.   Thus it was, quite
      literally,  "cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey." And
      so, another familiar phrase became part of the language.

      Now, aren't you glad you took the time to read this historical piece?
