      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  decided  to  upgrade  my  CD/RW  ...must  be  a  P.C.  thing, this
      upgrading,  I never felt the urge to upgrade the CD on the Amiga.  In
      fact,  I  was over the moon that my Amiga could use a CD, a re-writer
      was an impossible dream!!</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> However, times change.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  as  I  was  saying,  it  was time to get a faster re-writer.  My
      original one that came with the machine was a Samsung DVD combo drive
      that  wrote  at  X4  speed, and I was feeling less and less enchanted
      waiting for 20 minutes to burn an 80 minute audio disk.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The drive was faultless, it was simply now too slow for me.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  I  searched  around  and  had  a  look  at SVP Communications website
<font color=silver>http://www.121cdr.co.uk/ <font color=aqua>...a Company  that  I have used in the past,
      initially from a friend's recommendation and afterwards from personal
      experience.
</font></font></P><font color=silver><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SVP  had  a  few writers for sale and I perused the list.  One of the
      drives they recommended was a Liteon drive.  I had only vaguely heard
      of  Liteon,  but  the  site links to reviews and tests of the drives.
      This  is  a  nice  touch  for  anyone  wanting to find out more about
      products  to  help  make  up  their  mind  The drive in question is a
      24x10x40, that is, it writes at 24 speed, rewrites at 10 and reads at
      40.   So,  a  very fast drive.  Prices of drives are dropping all the
      time and the Liteon was no exception.  It came in at apprx.  £90.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  had  initially been looking at the Plextor, but SVP is very honest
      and  upfront  about  all  they sell, and had commented about why they
      stocked  Liteon...   They  had  taken one unit and been so impressed,
      that they had started to stock more Liteon products.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  read  the  tests  and  the  Liteon  came out roughly even with the
      Plextor,  although  the  Plextor has a 4mb buffer and the Liteon only
      2mb.  Both drives are burnproof (they have software to prevent buffer
      underruns).   Since  the Plextor was over £120, I decided to give the
      Liteon a try.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After  the drive was delivered..  a couple of days, dependant on when
      you order from the site, I set about fitting it.</P>


      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  decided  to  make a straight swop with the Samsung.  A few minutes
      sufficed  to  undo the cover on the computer (after switching off and
      unplugging everything), and remove the older drive.  My old drive was
      set  for  Secondary  slave  and  the leaflet that came with the drive
      showed  how to link the Liteon for the same.  After doing so, another
      couple  of moments to couple everything back up and replace covers in
      the  order  they came off.  I was quite surprised to find how easy it
      was  to  fit  the  drive.   It comes with leads, but the leads on the
      Samsung  were the same, so  no point in changing them.  Once this was
      done, it was a boot and the drive was recognised.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  Liteon comes supplied with an Ide, sorry E-Ide  lead, audio lead
      and  a  leaflet showing the backplane of the drive, to show where the
      leads  go and how to configure the link on the drive.  This is due to
      the  fact  that  the  manual  isn't of the printed variety, but a PDF
      document  on the software that comes with the drive.  The CD has Nero
      on  it  and  is a very nice , easy writing package to use.  Since the
      Liteon  is  a  fairly new drive, you may need to upgrade your burning
      software  to  get it to recognise the drive, if you decide not to use
      the  version  of  Nero  that  comes  with  it.   CD  Creator 4 didn't
      recognise  it,  but  the Roxio site says that it is supported in Disk
      Creator 5.  CloneCd also supports it as I had a look at their site as
      well.</P>

                    <font color=white><CENTER>How does the drive do? Excellent, mate!!</CENTER>
<P>
     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> An 80 minute disk takes just over 3½ minutes, so it's no slouch.  The
      review  of the drive said it didn't write at less than x8, but of the
      rewritables  I  use for backup, a couple are x2 and one is a x4.  The
      Liteon  handles  them  all beautifully.  Maybe they meant it wouldn't
      write normal CD/RW's at less than x8, but I don't have any disks that
      are  as slow as that and I've never bothered to go that slow to check
      it out.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  burnproof  technology  in  the  Liteon  is called Smart-burn and
      Smart X.  You can actually hear the drive slow and speed up while its
      burning.   No  more  wondering  if  I'll  get away with burning while
      online....</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  had  a  look  at the drive when I first took it out of the box, it
      doesn't look any different from any other.  The Liteon logo is on the
      drawer of the drive and, those all important figures are on the front
      of the drive as well.  There is a headphone jack and a volume control
      as  well as an LED  on the lhs of the unit front and the eject button
      is  on  the  rhs.   The  LED  glows  red  when burning and green when
      reading...</P>






      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  the  back of the drive, you have the e-ide interface, the digital
      audio socket, the analogue audio socket and the power socket.  Again,
      nothing out of the ordinary.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  case looks ok and is tidily built.  I find it hard to fault this
      drive  and  at  the price is a nice alternative to the more expensive
      Plextor.  You could do a lot worse than get one of these.  As for the
      buffer,  it  does tend to empty, but doesn't slow the drive down that
      much, maybe the next model will have a larger one.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  highly  recommended upgrade for all those that use a Cd-writer and
      don't want to shell out for a Plextor or Yamaha.</P>
