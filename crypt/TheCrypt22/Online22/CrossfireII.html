<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crossfire  1  was  freeware,  just  a  little  shoot 'em up that even
      nowadays still has some friends.  But most people didn't like the bad
      graphics and the missing ability to play the game alone.  To iron out
      these weak points Crossfire revamps now.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">For those who don't know Crossfire:  It's described best as a mixture
      of the well known games Stardust, X-Out and Wing Commander.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">More detailed:</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> You have three game modes to choose from.  In Dogfight mode from 2 up
      to  4  players  fight against each other.  The last player alive wins
      the  round.   After  a  adjustable  number  of  rounds the player who
      inflicted  the  most damage over all rounds wins.  Between the rounds
      the earned score can be invested in new weapons.</P>




     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  Survival  mode  is  new  in  Crossfire  2.  Upto 4 players fight
      against  the  hordes  of  computer controlled enemies.  The inflicted
      damage  is  also  converted  to  credits which new weapons are bought
      with.  A round lasts as long as one player is still alive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,  the  most  important mode is the Campaign mode.  The player
      gets  involved  in  a  complex  story  with  many different missions.
      Expect  everything  from  assault and attack mission up to escort and
      scout missions.  Between the missions you will get more and more into
      the story.  Important events are shown by rendered animations.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  mission is bigger than the screen, of course, so only a small part
      of  the  level  is visible at the same time.  The player has to fight
      against (or togehter with) every kind of ship, from small scout units
      up  to  big  cruisers  with  several independent cannons.  The player
      sometimes  gets  help from wing men who can be give commands.  Ground
      missions  are also included, once you're even able to control a tank.
      Variety is guaranteed therefore.</P>



     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> The Hardware:</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  contrast  to Crossfire 1 the second part will require much better
      hardware.   Needed  are at least a 030 CPU, 16 MB RAM plus either AGA
      or  a  Gfx  Board.   In  order  to  avoid  slowdowns  a  060  CPU  is
      recommended,  though.   I  suggest  not  to  use  the HiColor version
      without a PPC board.  Playing Crossfire II in 32000 colours will also
      need more RAM (about 24 MB)</P>
