<font color=lime><CENTER>by Liz Green and Baz Cann</CENTER>
<P>
<BR>

<font color=aqua><CENTER>It's October/November, and cold you'll agree,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> When the Borough Council send notice to me.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>"We'll fit you new kitchens" they proudly announce,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>"Starting any time now" - I'm ready to pounce!</CENTER>
      <CENTER>A Christmas with builders is not my idea</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Of happily welcoming in a New Year !</CENTER></font></P><font color=aqua>

 <CENTER>Is this a leg-pull; they must surely be joking,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>It's sadder than anything this side of Woking.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Give us plenty of warning is our plaintive plea,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>To our humble request they readily agree.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>The weeks turn to months, and time progresses on,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Not one single word of when it's to be done.</CENTER><p></P>

<CENTER> Until late in January when the neighbour comes round,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>The Prophets have spoken, they're coming around!</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Sheer panic and mayhem and rushing about,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>To clear all the kitchen so work can then start.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And urgent phone calls are hurriedly made,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>To alter the plans that were carefully laid.</CENTER><p></P>


<CENTER>Two days we are given to get the place clear,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> A perfect beginning to a perfect year.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And time off to make sure the job is done right,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>To make sure your possessions stay well within sight.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>The news that there will be no cooker for weeks</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Is enough to give anyone a dose of the shrieks!</CENTER><p></P>

<CENTER>While in the meanwhile, we are packed tight as hell,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Then someone informs us that all is not well!</CENTER>
      <CENTER>The painter is behind by several weeks,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And getting the rages, ranting and tweaks!</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Your units won't arrive for at least two days,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>So this is you're lot - best get used to these ways!</CENTER><p></P>

<CENTER> The plasterer/tiler will call around soon,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Aye, most probably at next full moon!</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Can't walk on the floors until things are all set,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>But that is a part that we haven't reached yet.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>So to this conclusion now have we drawn,</CENTER>
<CENTER> Due in part to the Council attracting our scorn</CENTER> 
<P>





<CENTER> If the job is worth doing, then do it yourselves,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>This lot are as useful as two garden elves!</CENTER>
      <CENTER>At least you can work round to suit as you please,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Instead of being brought sharply to your knees.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> The experience of taking the kids to the pub,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For something to eat is sure to make you blub.</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> Is this really stressful, why no, not a bit,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>As long as you make sure there's a worker to hit</CENTER>
      <CENTER>While typing this parody, curled up in a ball,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>For the space where I am is incredibly small</CENTER>
      <CENTER>So if I appear to be totally shattered,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>It's just that I'm in pain, hungry and Knackered !!!!!!</CENTER><P>
