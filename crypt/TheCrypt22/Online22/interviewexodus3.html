                             <font color=lime><CENTER>Editor: Anton Preinsack</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Andrzej, please can you introduce yourselve?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  name  is  Andrzej  Bugajny.  I'm 29 years old and live in Poland,
      Lodz  city.   I'm  work  in Sland Media.  I am the lead-pogrammer and
      projects director.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Do you own an Amiga? Which one?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I own an Amiga1200 Tower (OS3.1). Im also have and use an PC.</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Who stands behind the game "Exodus"?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well, there are many fantastic people:  The graphics (2D,3D) are made
      by  Mariusz  Samson  (I  think  that  he's  a  very  great artist and
      Amiga-fan),  Michal  Jesionowski  made the music, than there was also
      Slawomir  Witczak,  the  chief  of "Sland Media" (and my best friend,
      too),  DTP  graphics are by Leszek Boruszczak (big thanks to his wife
      for  help) and yet a few persons who help us when we need it.  And me
      of course.  I am inventing this game and programmed it.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">How long was the developing-time for this game?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around  three years...  well, it is a long time, because I programmed
      the  game  in "half-time".  No company or other persons financed this
      game-production,  so  I  need to continue my main-job.  By the way, I
      still  working there - as far all sales of "Exodus" covering only the
      production-costs.</P>


<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Are you happy with the sales and the feedback for "Exodus"?</P> 

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, the sales of "Exodus" are disappointing.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">You  released  a  GFX-Card-update  currently.   Will there be further
      updates for "Exodus"?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">No,  the  GFX-ugrade  is the last one, but there were plans for other
      upgrades, like a PPC-version.</P>




      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Will you release annother game for the Classic-AMIGA?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">No,  the  Amiga  classic  market  hasn't  a good future (it's only my
      opinion, of course).</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Is  there  a chance to see a follower of "Exodus" in general?  (Maybe
      on Amiga OS 4.0 or MorphOS?)</P>

<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> This depends to the the market-situation.</P> 


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> What happended to the announced AMIGA-game "Husaria"?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> This project now is breake.  Mayby we´ll back to it in future.</P>


    <font color=aqua> <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Will you develop software for the AMIGA DE?</P>

     <font color=yellow> <P ALIGN="LEFT">We think about this, but I can't say any more now.</P>




      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">What  do  you think about the current situation an the plans of AMIGA
      Inc.?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They  have the one good project the AmigaDE, many plans and...nothing
      more.   I  think  that  they should concentrate all their strength on
      AmigaDE system.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">What do you think about Pegasos and MorphOS?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  don't think about Pegasos yet.  I've tracking MorphOS progress and
      I  need to say, that I have big respect to the MorphOS authors.  They
      are  made  a  great work for Amiga community even if appears that its
      too late.</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> What are your current projects and your plans for the future?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I would do the second part of Exodus and continue the Husaria project
      as well.  We have also an idea for quite new games but now its secret
      ;-) Currently, I am preparing to convert Exodus to PC hardware.  I am
      waiting for AmigaDE on new Amiga hardware or PC mayby.  I still would
      like to make games for Amiga.</P>



      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Which games do you play in your spare-time?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Sometimes I´m playing "HeroesIII" or "Giants:  Citizen Kabuto".</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Other hobbies?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  is  my generaly hobby.  I'm just joking ;-).  If I have time, I
      like  reading  books  SF,  fantasy  (now  I  am at the end of reading
      fantasy   novels  by  Andrzej  Sapkowski)  and  I  am  reading  about
      technology.   I  like  walking to cinema and listennig to music.  And
      over  all  that  I love videogames (probably this is the reason why I
      programing games).</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Thank you very much for the interview and good luck for the future!</P>

    <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">  Thank you, too!</P>
