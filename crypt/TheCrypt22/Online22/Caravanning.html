<font color=red><H1><CENTER>SO YOU WANT TO TAKE UP CARAVANNING</CENTER></H1>
<font color=yellow><CENTER>by Chris Skelhorn </CENTER>
      
      
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Caravanning,  depending  on  your  viewpoint, is something you either
      love or hate.  There appears to be no middle ground.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may have been times when, whilst travelling, and you may or may
      not  have been in a hurry, that there's been one of these overloaded,
      bucking,   swaying,   menace-to-society,  monstrosities  precariously
      balanced  on the back of an elderly, gutless old rust-bucket, piloted
      by an obviously insane, woolly-headed moron.......</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or  is  it  that  you  can't  see  that  the  caravan is one of those
      state-of-the -art supervans towed by a chariot more than adequate for
      the  job?   And  he's  just being held up by one of those morons that
      hate  caravans,  purely  because  they  were  once held up by one for
      almost 12 seconds, 30 years ago!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  must point out that I'm no expert.  Yes, I've been caravanning for
      years  and yes, I once towed a Transit on a trailer 70-odd miles with
      a  2-  litre  Espace (probably a foolhardy move!) but there have been
      many, many people that have done more miles than me!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I don't class caravanners (or motorhomers, or trailer-tenters) as any
      different  to any other motorist.  With the possible exception of the
      occasional  lamer  with  a box trailer, that will not propel his aged
      Marina (the car, not the wife) beyond a stiff walking pace!</P>
     
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  have  been  dragging my tin-tent around the country for nigh on 20
      years now, and without fail, I have found at least one person on each
      journey  that speeds up when I try to overtake, or pulls out in front
      of me, or.....</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mind  you,  for  each of those I have found countless peeps that move
      over  to  give  me a little extra room, flash their lights to tell me
      it's   safe   to  move  in  or  out,  or  give  way  when  they  have
      the right-of-way.....</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">But  the actual dragging of such an outfit around is a daunting task,
      isn't it?</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> No!!   Caravans  are designed to be easy to move, whether on site, on
      your  car,  or  in  storage.   Just be aware of the dimensions of the
      thing  and  you'll be OK.  Every time I hitch up, I spend the first 5
      miles or so, studying the trailer as much as I study the road.  After
      the  first 50 miles, you can easily forget the thing is there, but it
      could be dangerous if you do!</P>

     
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A   caravan  width  is  limited  by  law  so  that  cars  (and  small
      commercials)  can use short extension mirrors to see along the sides.
      Most  caravans are about 6"4' to 6"8' wide, but there have been a few
      made that are narrower.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  length  is  usually  governed  by  the  weight,  but there is no
      formulae that dictates x (length) = y (weight).</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  AL-KO chassis that 99% of caravan manufacturers use is available
      in  4  lengths,  and  just bolted together differently.  The axle and
      suspension  is  basically  one  unit,  with  2  or 3 different weight
      limits.  The axle tube also acts as a cross brace for the chassis.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Altogether,  the weight limitations can be very similar, although the
      amount  of bodywork can vary.  Thus sometimes you can take more stuff
      with you although you have a smaller 'van!</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If  you  look at caravan weights, you'll see that Carlights are quite
      heavy,  substantial 'vans, and for a similar weight, a Sterling could
      be 3 feet longer, and have 2 more berths!</P>

   
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This is partly due to the construction of the vehicle.  Carlights are
      made  in  the  'traditional'  way;  a  wooden  skeleton has aluminium
      panelling attached to the outside, glass-fibre matting is then pushed
      into  the gaps, and finally, 'faced' hardboard panels are bonded into
      place.   These  panels  are  screwed  to  the floor, which in turn is
      attached  to  the chassis.  The furniture is then fitted.  The drawer
      fronts, cupboard doors, and wardrobe are typically solid wood.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  the  'modern' sandwich method, the aluminium panel is laid out,
      wooden reinforcements are bonded to the sheet, then the insulation is
      bonded  to  the  sheet,  and finally the decorative interior panel is
      bonded  to that.  Then the whole thing is cut to shape, and holes for
      the windows, vents, and door are cut out.  All the panels (1 front, 2
      sides,  back  and  roof)  are  bonded together, and the whole is then
      bonded  to  the  floor.   The  floor  is a bonded sandwich of ply and
      insulation  foam.   And  then  the furniture is fitted.  The doors in
      this  case are more usually hollow with a veneer facing, or sometimes
      'blown' plastic.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  bonded  construction is much lighter than the traditional method
      and can sometimes make a difference of 20% in a complete caravan.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not  only  that,  but  an  acrylic  window  is  much lighter than the
      equivalent area of wall.</P>
     
                                 <font color=green><CENTER>WEIGHT FOR IT!</CENTER>
<P>     
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When you're towing, you have to be aware that your car is now 2 and a
      half  times  longer!  It's also 2 and a half times slower and takes 2
      and a half times longer to stop!</P> 
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually, no car and trailer should be 2 and a half times heavier, as
      it's  not  legal  to  tow  anything  that is heavier than the unladen
      weight  of  the  tug.  It's also better to keep to the 85% rule, i.e.
      if  your  car's  unladen weight is exactly 1000Kg, make sure that the
      trailer's maximum weight is no more than 850Kg.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> That  doesn't  mean that you can load your trailer to 85% of the kerb
      weight  of  your car!  If your car can tow 1100Kg, but your trailer's
      max  is 900Kg, common sense dictates that you stop loading before you
      get to it!</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You'll  also find that there is this little thing called nose-weight.
      This  is  designed  to  keep  the  front  end of the caravan slightly
      heavier  than the back, otherwise you'll get this horrible 'pitching'
      which will lift the back of the car, rather like a see-saw.  Not only
      will  all  your  passengers  give  forth  with  their last meal, very
      quickly,  but  as  the back of the car is pushed down by the trailer,
      the  front  will  lift,  with the resultant loss of steering.  Have I
      just frightened you?  Good!</P>
     
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nose-weight is dependent on the towcar, but usually ranges between 50
      and  160 pounds, and is not to be exceeded!  The easiest way to weigh
      this  is  to  cut a length of broom handle, stick the bathroom scales
      under the coupling, and prop the broom handle between the two.  Quite
      how you explain greasy bathroom scales and a vandalised broom to your
      other 'arf has never been revealed to me!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now,  as  a  caravan is approximately the same shape as a garden shed
      (with   similar   aerodynamics!)  it  is  also  susceptible  to  wind
      resistance, which can come from the front AND the sides.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  to  load  a  'van  properly,  you  MUST  put all the heavy goods
      (awning,  TV,  water container, boxes of tinned foods, etc.) directly
      over  the  axle.   The  medium  weight  stuff  (e.g.   awning  poles,
      Porta-Potti)  can go on the floor towards the front and rear, and the
      light  stuff  (bedding)  can  be  stowed  wherever,  keeping the 'van
      balanced.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">With adequate and sensible loading, a caravan that has been loaded to
      capacity, will handle no differently to an empty one.</P>
  
   
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  bow-wave  of  a fast artic that can take a scarecrows hat off at
      three fields will not make a properly loaded trailer move more than a
      foot out of line.  And then it'll be out, in, and corrected.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Ignore sensible loading advice, and the first time out, the tail will
      wag the dog, and Bryant and May will help you clear up the mess!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK  so  what  can  a  car  tow?  All cars registered since the 1st of
      August  2000  have to have type-approved towbars.  This is to prevent
      people doing stupid things, like overloading them.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Some small cars can tow caravans, and some can't.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By  small  cars,  I mean Renault Clio's, Vauxhall Corsa's, and Nissan
      Micra's.   Some  small  cars have not been type-approved, such as the
      Ford Ka, Vauxhall Tigra, and Daewoo Matiz.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many others that have been treated in this way, for reasons
      other  than that of pulling power.  If you've designed a sports coupe
      that  has the power, agility, and stance of a cheetah, would you want
      some  plonker hanging a greenhouse on it?  Probably not, so you don't
      type-approve it!</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Which  is  why  you  won't see the likes of TVR, Ferrari, and Porkers
      pulling Searchers about.</P>
     
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">There are a number of caravans that are designed specifically for the
      smaller cars named above, like Eriba's, and the Freedom range.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  even  with  a  little  car, you can toddle along to your friendly
      dealer, and he will take a wodge of your wonga, and attach a suitable
      towing apparatus to the blunt end of your transport.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  should also make sure that there are either one or two electrical
      sockets  flanking  such  bracketry.  These are needed because you are
      legally required to have certain lamps on any trailer.  These include
      stop,  tail, turn, and rear fog lights.  You may have reversing lamps
      too,  the law simply states that IF reversing lamps are fitted, there
      must  be  no more than two, they must be white, and they must only be
      used whilst going backwards.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  first  electrical  connection  (denoted  12N)  has either 7 or 8
      separate  connections  in  it,  one  each  for  left indicator, right
      indicator,  brake  lights, left parking lights, right parking lights,
      and  an  earth.   The  more  perceptive reader may notice that only 6
      cables  have been used.  The last one (or two in an 8-way) is for the
      rear  fog light.  The 7-way simply switches the rear lamp on, but the
      8-way  cuts  out  the  towcar's  rear  foglight,  thus  stopping  the
      reflection off the front of the trailer!</P>
     
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  second socket (the 12S) contains the power for reversing lights,
      interior light, battery-charging and the fridge.</P>
     
                                     <font color=green><CENTER> DIY?</CENTER>
 <P>    
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  better  brackets  are  from  well-established names like Witter,
      Dixon-Bate  and  Brink.   Towsure  are adequate, but some can be real
      swines to fit!</P> 
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also,  if  your  intended  tug  has a rear light monitor, injudicious
      wiring can cause it to throw a wobbly.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most 'bars can be fitted in less than a day by a reasonably competent
      DIYer,  but  some  cars  need  to  have a section cut out of the rear
      bumper.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pricing?  Well, a 'bar fitted to a Xantia Estate, with twin electrics
      will set you back around £200.  Buying all the bits tops around £130,
      so  fitting  comes to £70.  Now consider the fact you may have to cut
      your rear bumper.  Get it wrong, and a replacement would be the thick
      end of 300 sovs.  All of a sudden, £70 is peanuts, innit?</P>
     
                                <font color=green><CENTER>OUT IN THE COLD.</CENTER>
<P>    
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many  caravanners  have 'progressed' from tents, or trailer tents.  I
      have  no problem with that, but I have tried tenting, and didn't like
      it too much!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing that put me off was not being able to stand up to get
      dressed!  The second was after the first night of rain!  At least you
      can have a heater in a caravan, and a wash or shower, without braving
      the  elements.   True,  it's possible to buy some huge tents, some of
      which  can  sleep  8 peeps in four separated 'rooms', but you have to
      have either a large car to stick everything away into, or bung it all
      in a trailer......</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motorhomers,  by  the nature of the beast, have to pack everything up
      to  travel  anywhere,  whilst  all  other campers can leave their kit
      behind.  They also have to be aware of the size of their machines, as
      many  car  parks have height or width restrictions.  Some MH'ers have
      taken  to  towing a small car behind their vehicles.  It seems odd to
      pull a car with a caravan!  It's not a bad idea, though, but road tax
      is effectively doubled.</P>



     
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motorhomes can vary wildly in size.  There are some that are based on
      Citroen  Visa  vans,  and  I recently saw a converted Daihatsu Hi-Jet
      (Bedford  Rascal).   I don't know how many berths it had, it may just
      have been one, or it may have had bunks!  On the other hand, a friend
      borrowed  a Winnebago a few years ago.  This had two king size double
      beds,  air-conditioning,  central  heating, triple glazing, satellite
      navigation,   a   fully   fitted   kitchen,   (with  microwave  oven,
      dish-washer,  washing  machine and a tumble dryer!) shower...  it was
      better equipped than many houses!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People  ask  why  I like 'vanning.  I don't know.  Why do people like
      paintings,  or  gardening, or photography?  Or anything else, come to
      that.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  I  was  young,  and went caravanning with my parents, I used to
      love  the  hiss  of the gas lights.  We used to take a radio as there
      weren't  many  12-volt  TV's  in  the sixties!  Sadly, nowadays, many
      'vans  don't  have  gas lights.  And we can't be bothered to take the
      telly....  Mind you, with a mains hook-up, I can take the computer!</P>




     
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  parents  never used an awning.  When I bought my first caravan, a
      10-foot Sprite 400, it was supplied with one.  No instructions, but I
      had  a  notion  how  it worked!  An awning can effectively double the
      size  of  any 'van, and it can be used for storage, sleeping, cooking
      or as a porch to dump muddy wellies in.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">OK, so you've decided to take the plunge and got the bug, what do you
      need?</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First,  is  your car suitable?  Only you can answer that.  If there's
      just you and the other 'arf and you have an Escort/Astra/Focus/Megane
      sized  car,  not  much  of  a problem.  Any mainstream 14 footer will
      suffice.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  if  there's  5  of  you, and you only have a Clio or Metro, your
      choices  are  limited.   New, a Freedom to suit you will set you back
      £4,000  or so, and if you choose the better model with more bells and
      whistles,  you can say goodbye to around £5k.  If that is beyond your
      means,  then  a second-hand Eriba Puck in good condition will command
      from  £2500  and  up, or you could aim for a Sprite Cadet.  Check the
      weight of your car and don't go over 85% for the 'van!</P>

      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> You  will  need  to  make  a list of personal items to take with you,
      clothes,  toiletries,  footwear,  etc.   Then  make  another  list of
      general stuff like towels etc.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the caravan itself, you'll have to either raid the kitchen of two
      or  three  saucepans, kettle (with lead!) tin opener, kitchen knives,
      etc.   Individual  cutlery,  and  crockery, is probably best obtained
      from  a  camping  store.   Melamine  plates  weigh  about  a third of
      ceramics, and you'll need a dinner plate, side plate, cup or mug, and
      a  soup/cereal  bowl  each.   May  be a good idea to grab a 'plastic'
      glass each, too!</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You'll  need  a  pack each of kitchen and toilet rolls before you set
      out,  as well as a mains hook-up lead (about £25 for a 25 Metre lead)
      tea-towels, washing-up liquid, dish-cloth, first-kid kit.</P>
    
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't  forget  matches  or tapers (gas can be tricky!) and an ashtray
      even  if  you  don't  smoke, 'coz you have to drop the 'dead' matches
      somewhere.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ah yes, check the gas bottles.  Not so much that they're still there,
      but  if  they're  empty,  they're  about  as much good as a chocolate
      fireguard.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You'll  need pillows and such.  I still prefer to have a single sheet
      and  blanket  over  me, as duvets and sleeping bags are too hot.  But
      remember to take a couple more blankets than you need!  Most partners
      don't appreciate frozen tootsies in the middle of their back at 4 am!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  must  also  appreciate  that  caravan  beds are also supposed to
      double up as seats, and so are not going to be as comfortable as your
      own bed.  It may be necessary to lay some extra padding on the bed.</P>
   
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  need  to  have a good think about the kit you need, we've always
      forgotten  something  when  we're  away, although most site shops are
      very helpful in that respect!</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We  usually  take enough food for the first two days, so if we arrive
      late and wake up late the next day, we won't desperately need to find
      a food shop.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If  you  use  a  supermarket,  try and snaffle some of those 'tomato'
      boxes.   They're  good  for  packing tins into, as they don't get too
      heavy,  and  they  fit through a caravan doorway easily.  The lettuce
      boxes may prove too big.  When you've got the boxes in, leave them on
      the floor directly over the axle for travelling.</P> 




      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another  thing  to  remember  is that when you want to come home, the
      sawn  off broom handle and the bathroom scales are likely to still be
      in  the  garage  (along  with some of the other stuff you forgot!) so
      loading is going to be slightly more tricky.  Not only that, but I'll
      bet you'll be coming back with more than you went with!</P>
     
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Just remember to keep very heavy items on the floor over the axle.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Later  on  you  can look forward to towing tips, site reports, towcar
      guides, etc.  But in the meantime, happy 'vanning.</P>
