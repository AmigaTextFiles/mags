<CENTER>Amiga Forever V4.0 - The Amiga Emulator CD-ROM</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga  Forever is the all-in-one Amiga emulation and  connectivity
      environment  for PCs,  officially licensed by Amiga International.
      We are pleased to announce the release of Amiga Forever 4.0.  This
      new  version includes version 3.1 of the Amiga ROM  and  OS  files
      and  AGA  support under WinUAE.  Additional preinstalled  programs
      and features,  like for example Personal Paint, DirectoryOpus 5.5,
      TurboText,   drag- and-drop LhA de-archiving and  the  ToolManager
      dock have been updated.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  version additionally includes an archive with a new,  ready-
      to-run PowerMac version.  This emulation is currently the only way
      of  having an Amiga laptop (if we assume that you install it on  a
      PC laptop or on a Mac Powerbook/iBook)</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">New features of Amiga Forever 4.0:</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-  GlowIcon  look  (as used in Amiga OS 3.5,  but also  compatible
      with NewIcons and MagicWB)</P>
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> -  Option to switch entire environment from "new look" (GlowIcons)
      to "old look" (Classic) and vice versa</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-  Amiga  Explorer  4.0 (includes revolutionary self-install  over
      serial cable, plus new Cut, Copy, Paste functions)</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">- Built-in support for ADZ and DMS disk image files</P> 
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-  Print  spooler (easily print all Amiga documents under Windows,
      bypassing parallel port emulation)</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-  New  emulation  and Workbench configuration results  in  faster
      emulation of the Amiga CPU</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">- New MenuBox launcher (easier to use) </P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">- Dozens of other enhancements and new add-ons</P> 
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-  MPEG-1  videos (CD-ROM version):  The Deathbed Vigil (one  hour
      and 58 minutes) and Jay Miner Speech (49 minutes)</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Forever 4.0 - Overview</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga  Forever contains state of the art software to  satisfy  two
      major needs of many Amiga users:  to share data between Amiga  and
      other systems,  and to use their existing Amiga software and  data
      on  non-  Amiga hardware.  Additionally,  software,  tutorial  and
      reference  files which are likely to be of interest to  any  Amiga
      enthusiast are included with the CD-ROM.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Forever 4.0 includes: </P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Officially licensed Amiga ROM and OS files,  versions  1.3  and
      3.1.   The  CD-ROM  includes  additional  versions  of  historical
      interest (all generic versions between 1.0 and 3.1 that have  been
      officially released ).</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Amiga  Explorer 3.5 networking software,  which allows  you  to
      connect  an  Amiga  to one or more PCs,  and  access  Amiga  files
      (including  virtual ADF and ROM files),  directories  and  volumes
      directly  from  the Windows Desktop.  Amiga Explorer  is  easy  to
      install  and  configure  and includes direct  support  for  serial
      (null  modem)   cable connections,  as well as TCP/IP.   Automatic
      installation  of  the  Amiga side through the  same  serial  cable
      which  can  later be used by the software itself.   No  additional
      terminal  program,  PC filing system or other tools are  required.
      Before  Amiga  Explorer  3.5   this   used  to  be  considered  an
      impossible task!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Dave   Haynie's   legendary   Deathbed   Vigil   Video  ...   a
      documentation  about  the last hours of  Commodore  with  lots  of
      interviews,   a  view into the buildings and the  final  discharge
      party</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> -  Exclusive interview with Jay Miner,  "Father of the Amiga",  on
      topics  ranging  from  the birth of the  Amiga  to  computers  and
      society in form of an audio track.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  UAE  Amiga  emulator  for  Windows ("WinUAE").   All  emulation
      support files (Amiga ROM and OS,  Cloanto Amiga software,  Picasso
      96  drivers,   etc.)  can easily be used by other  implementations
      (DOS,  Linux,  Be,  Next,  etc.) of these emulators, as well as by
      future  new  versions.  On the CD-ROM version the Fellow  emulator
      for  DOS  and experimental versions of UAE for PowerPC  Amiga  and
      PowerMac systems are also included.  Source code for the emulation
      software (including the Linux version of UAE)  is included in  the
      "Archives" directory of the CD-ROM.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Picasso  96  drivers  for the emulation  software,   supporting
      palette modes up to 256 colors, as well as true color.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Cloanto  Personal  Paint  7.1b  (paint,   animation  and  image
      processing  software,  with short tutorials),  DirDiff  5.1  (file
      synchronization  and  replication  software),   AmiToRTF  4.2  (to
      convert  texts  from  Amiga to Windows  formats)   and  MailBX  to
      convert Amiga mail archives to Microsoft Mail, Outlook Express and
            Exchange  Server.   A copy of these programs  is  installed  in  a
      directory which is easily accessible from "real" Amiga systems.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Bonus software by third parties,  such as the TurboText  editor
      (an  exclusive  version  with   the   latest  patches),   KingCON,
      archiving and extraction tools,  all preinstalled for  easy  drag-
      and-drop functionality with ToolManager.  Documentation  for  this
      software is available from the Amiga (emulation) side
</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  Tutorials and FAQs on data sharing,  emulation,  floppy  disks,
      serial links, TCP/IP, UAE, Fellow and much more.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-  The  CD-ROM  is  a  multi-platform CD (ISO,  Rock-Ridge  Amiga,
      Joliet and Audio).  The Macintosh files, which contain a ready-to-
      run  (experimental)  PowerMac configuration,  are contained  in  a
      StuffIt archive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Supported Platforms</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Amiga emulation software comes preinstalled and preconfigured
      for  Windows  and DOS on Intel platforms.  The Amiga  ROM  and  OS
      files  can  be used by any implementation of the Amiga  emulators,
      including  for  example Unix/Linux (UAE comes with  source  code),
      Be,  PowerMac,  etc.  These emulators are constantly updated,  and
      can be downloaded from the Internet.</P>

            <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  emulation  software  included with  Amiga  Forever  does  not
      require a "real" Amiga.  On Windows systems,  the emulation can be
      either  installed or run directly from CD (without  installation).
      The ready-to- run (experimental)  PowerMac version is included  in
      a  StuffIt  archive,   from where  it  can  be  extracted  to  the
      Macintosh hard disk.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Explorer and Documentation</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Amiga Explorer software,  the automatic program launcher  and
      the automatic installation software are specifically designed  for
      Windows.   The  Amiga Explorer networking software is  independent
      from the emulation part, and can be installed separately.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Amiga  software and documentation included in  Amiga  Forever
      are  completely  independent from  both  the  networking  and  the
      emulation  components,  and can be accessed on an Amiga  computer,
      or  from  the  emulation  environment.   The  Amiga  software  and
      documentation  are   also   preinstalled   in  the  Amiga  Forever
      emulation environment.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  main Amiga Forever documentation is in HTML format,  and  can
      be read with any web browser.  The Amiga-specific documentation is
      in  AmigaGuide  format,   and in part  also  in  HTML.   The  main
      documentation is in English.  The documentation of Personal  Paint
      is in English,  German and Italian. Some Amiga emulation tutorials
      by third parties are in German,  French,  Polish and Italian.  The
      Amiga  ROM and OS files on Amiga Forever include localizations  in
      all languages supported by the Amiga OS.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Forever 4 is £39.99</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">5. Network PC</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  simple  Amiga to PC Networking system that allows an  Amiga  to
      read  and write to a PC.  The Amiga can read & write to  and  from
      any  drives  on  the  physically mounted on  the  PC  or  remotely
      mounted from an existing network.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  system  is fast and simple to set-up and comes complete  with
      all  software  required on both floppy disk and compact  disc  for
      the  Amiga  and PC.  It is also complete with the required  cable.
      Network  PC  transfers  data via the parallel  ports  on  the  two
      computers  and  is  thus  very fast when compared  to  null  modem
      cables and yet is no more expensive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  complete kit contains a 3m cable,  two floppy disks,  one  CD
      and  full instructions on setting and running Network PC.  The  CD
      also  contains many extras that enhance the system  and  help  you
      really make use of the powerful networking facilities provided.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How  does  it  work? Well the PC runs a simple DOS server  program
      under Windows 95/98.  Windows 95 or 98 ensure that the PC can cope
      with  the  Amiga's long filename system and allow the  Network  PC
      Server  to multitask with other programs.  On the Amiga  a  simple
      icon is run to 'mount' the PC on the Amiga.  On Workbench an  icon
      labeled 'PC' is mounted and inside there is a drawer for  each  of
      the  PC's drives.  So to access the 'c' drive from the PC  on  the
      Amiga the path would be 'PC:c/'.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  Workbench programs capable of reading volumes mounted on  the
      Amiga  will be able to read from and write to the PC drives.   For
      example you do not need to copy data over to the Amiga to work  on
      it,   just use your Amiga programs to load the data directly  from
      the  PC  into the Amiga and then save it directly out  to  the  PC
      when you are finished.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Network  PC  is  capable of running at over  45k/sec  and  is  the
      fastest  solution for a cost effective way to share  data  between
      an Amiga and a PC available.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Network PC is only £12.99</P>
