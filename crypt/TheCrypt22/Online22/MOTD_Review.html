      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mystery  of  the  Druids  is one of the latest  additions  to  the
      adventure  genre,  created by German company House  of  Tales  and
      only very recently released in the Britian. </P>
 
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mystery  of  the  Druids comes on 3 CDs,  labeled  "Installation",
      "The  Present" and "The Past".  This already gives you some  hints
      about the game (yes,  time travel plays an important role  in  the
      game).   The  installation CD isn't even half  full  and  contains
      files  that need to be copied to your hard drive.  The  other  two
      are  the actual game CDs - no annoying CD swapping is involved  by
      the way.  But here we come to the first problem with the game.  If
      you  have  a modern CD-ROM or DVD-ROM,  you know that playing  CD-
      based  games is not much fun due to the drive constantly  spinning
      up  and down.  But that's not the game's fault,  right? Well,  no.
      But the game's big fault is that it doesn't offer installation  to
      harddrive,  even if that is possible!  The installer doesn't  give
      the  slightest hint about this option and there is no readme file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  found the information neatly tucked away in a FAQ on the game's
      web site.  But naturally I only went looking for a FAQ when I  was
      in trouble, not before installing the game.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But on to the actual game.  The introduction scene shows some sort
      of  mysterious  ritual  taking place at druids'  favorite  meeting
      place,  Stonehenge.  When the intro is over,  you find yourself in
      the Scotland Yard,  London,  present time. You are detective Brent
      Halligan,  member of the glorious murder squad.  Your  boss  calls
      you  to  his  office  and  explains the precarious  situation  the
      department is in:  there has been a series of strange killings, so
      called  "skeleton  murders" where only skeletons  of  the  victims
      have been found.  A man has been convicted and sentenced to jail -
      and  killed  by  a  cellmate.    Nothing   too   unusual  so  far.
      Unfortunately,  another skeleton perfectly matching  the  previous
      ones has been found which means the man had been innocent and  the
      real murderer is on the loose (and the press wants someone's  head
      on the platter).</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your  task now is to find the true murderer.  This of course won't
      be  easy  as  your only clue is the skeleton.  I don't think  I'll
      spoil  the  game  for  anyone when I say that ancient  and  modern
      druids  will soon be involved in the investigation.  Unfortunately
      your boss doesn't want to hear about druids so you're pretty  much
      on  your  own  - although you will meet a few people  prepared  to
      help you.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the  first part of the game you'll spend a lot of time  around
      Scotland  Yard  offices,   fighting  bureaucracy  and  wonderfully
      unhelpful co-workers as well as learning useful information in  the
      forensics lab.  And there's another of my gripes.  It is  possible
      to  partially  solve  several  puzzles  before  you  can  actually
      complete  them.  It is often quite clear what the objective  is  -
      but there is no way to tell that something entirely unrelated  has
      to  happen  first (as opposed to you simply missing some important
      clue).  This is rather confusing to say the least. Talk about non-
      linear.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  is a lot of dialogue at the beginning of the game and  that
      could  be  improved too.  Not that I mind long dialogues,   but  I
      didn't  much like those in Mystery of the Druids.  In  many  cases
      there were lots of options and perhaps one of them would lead  you
      further.   Unfortunately the topics you  already  discussed  often
      don't  disappear and aren't marked in any way.  As a result,   you
      have  to  listen  to  some sentences ten or fifteen  times  before
      you've mined all the information you have to,  and sometimes  it's
      hard  to  tell whether you've exhausted all options or not.   This
      doesn't improve the gameplay much.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Speaking  of dialogues,  there's one other nit,  not  specific  to
      Mystery of the Druids in any way:  in many cases the captions  are
      slightly  (actually sometimes almost completely)   different  from
      what  the  people  actually say.  I assume in this  case  this  is
      mostly  due  to  the  translation from German.</P>
  
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  investigation will lead you to several places around  England
      and  even France.  One of those places is Oxford where you'll meet
      a handsome young anthropologist,  Dr Melanie Turner. Yes, there is
      some romance involved.  You'll even get to play Melanie on several
      occasions although most of the time she's just a passive  sidekick
      giving  you  potentially useful bits of information about  druids,
      their beliefs and their rituals.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  is  a good time for a warning.  If you are squeamish,   avoid
      Mystery  of the Druids.  There are a few rather bloody scenes  and
      one  of them is pretty revolting.  Nothing that would turn  off  a
      hardened adventurer like me, but don't say I didn't warn you.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And here we come to the puzzles.  Most of them are inventory based
      and  not  overly difficult.  Oh,  the inventory - there's  another
      gripe.   Even  at  the end of the game our  hero  Brent  is  still
      lugging  around  items found at the beginning and  now  completely
      useless.  That means the inventory is rather large and this in  my
      opinion  does  not add to playability at all.  It  would  be  much
      better  if the game "flushed" the inventory from time to time  and
      removed the useless items.  It would be logical too - it's  rather
      surprising  that  Brent doesn't lose any of the  junk  considering
      what he has to go through.  And while I'm complaining let me  tell
      you that there's some pixel hunting too.  Several objects are very
      hard  to  find.   This wouldn't be so much of  a  problem  if  you
      sometimes  didn't  have access to perhaps 30  screens  at  a  time
      containing  a  total of four or five objects.  That makes  finding
      them really difficult.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  are  a few non-inventory based puzzles too (even  one  nice
      labyrinth)  and again,  most of them are not difficult or  can  be
      solved with pencil and paper and a bit of time.  But one of  those
      puzzles  was  pretty hellish and I'm sure I'd never  get  past  it
      without a walkthrough.  It's not that it was completely illogical,
      there  were just too many possibilities and far too few  clues.But
      on the whole, the game is pretty playable and I enjoyed it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had some gripes with the game's story too,  although those might
      not  be  shared  by other players.  I just have trouble  accepting
      certain  things  in games (and movies too).   I  have  no  problem
      accepting time travel for some odd reason.  But I have  a  problem
      with  far  more  mundane  (in a manner of speaking)   things  like
      present  day  druids conducting their rituals  at  Stonehenge.   I
      mean,   have you ever been there? I have and let me tell you  that
      there's  no way that would happen.  The whole place is fenced  and
      you're  not  allowed inside the inner stone circle at  all.   Plus
      Stonehenge  is swamped with tourists.  If you wanted  a  realistic
      scene of druidic rituals at Stonehenge,  you'd have to add lots of
      tourists and probably some TV too.  Yes,  I know that would  spoil
      the game. Forget I said anything.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And  here  we  come  to the game art.  Let me tell  you  that  the
      artists  working  on the game were better than the  programmers  -
      that  so  much  reminds  me  of many Sierra  games  with  stunning
      graphics  and  music and sometimes buggy to  the  point  of  being
      unplayable.   Anyway the graphics in Mystery  of  the  Druids  are
      really pretty.  The game uses the 2 1/2 D style previously seen in
      popular  titles like Grim Fandango or The Longest  Journey.   That
      is,  there are 3D animated characters on a 2D background. Only the
      character  animation in the FMV sequences  could  be  better  (but
      there  isn't  that  much  FMV).  Some of the  game  locations  are
      modeled after real places (Stonehenge comes to mind)  while others
      are  entirely  imaginary.  All of them look  pretty  good  on  the
      screen.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  sound isn't bad either.  The music is very pleasant  and  the
      voiceovers  are good.  The characters speak with markedly  British
      accents.  I've actually heard some complaints that the accents  of
      the  main  characters  were too "posh".   While  I  agree  that  a
      Scotland  Yard  detective probably doesn't speak  exactly  Queen's
      English,  I certainly expect an Oxford anthropologist  to  have  a
      posh accent. This was not one of my gripes.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  two halves of the game - present and past - seemed noticeably
      different  to  me (which is not a negative).  In  the  first  part
      there  is a great deal of talking and traveling with new locations
      opening  and  most   of   the   previously   visited  still  being
      accessible.  In the other half there are far fewer people to  meet
      and much less traveling (but the locations are larger).  Also  the
      progress  is more linear with no going back - instead,  there  are
      more puzzles to solve.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Just  for the sake of completeness I should probably mention  that
      there  are one or two moments where it is possible  to  die  -  so
      don't attempt to win the entire game without saving.  But  as  far
      as I could tell there are no dead ends and the game can always  be
      finished (provided that you don't get killed of course).
</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And now it's time for me to weigh the pros and cons of Mystery  of
      the  Druids.   I  had hard time deciding whether I actually  liked
      this game or not.  It is certainly mysterious and there are druids
      too.   The  game boasts quality artwork.  I liked the story  which
      kept me glued to the screen for longer than is good for me.  There
      is  enough blood and gore to keep me interested.  But some of  the
      puzzles are just plain frustrating and there are bugs too.</P>
