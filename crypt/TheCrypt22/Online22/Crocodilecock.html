      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A bloke walks into a crowded bar with a crocodile under his arm.  The
      barman says ""You can't bring that in here, it's a wild animal.""</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "No  it's  not,  it's  perfectly tame, watch this"...  and places the
      croc  on  the table, forces it's jaws wide apart, then flops his dick
      out and places it delicately on the lower teeth of the croc.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">He  then  whips a baseball bat from nowhere and larries the croc over
      the head with it.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The croc goes mad, takes a sharp intake of breath and snaps it's jaws
      down  to  within  a gnats bollock of it's owners dick.  At this stage
      you  could  hear  a  gnat fart in the crowded bar.  Then casually the
      bloke puts his dick away, into his trousers.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Anyone else fancy having a dabble at that for 500 quid." He asks.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up leaps a little old lady at the back of the bar.  "I'll do it, I'll
      do  it"  ...  she shouts, "So long as you don't hit me as hard as you
      hit that fucking crocodile.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">One day a little boy comes bounding in from the back garden, and runs
      straight to his mother.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Son: Mum, are birds made of metal.?</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Mum: Of course not, why do you ask such a silly thing.?</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Son: It's just dad's outside, and he said he wants to screw the arse
      off the bird next door!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  day  Mrs  Flanagan  feels  sickly, and goes to the doctor, to be
      checked  out.   The  doctor  looks  her  over and says, "Well now Mrs
      Flanagan,  I'm  perplexed  on your condition but if you bring a urine
      specimen to me in the morning, I can tell exactly what's wrong."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs  Flanagan went home and said to her husband, "The doctor wants me
      to  bring  him  a urine specimen in the morning.  I don't know what a
      urine specimen is, what am I to do?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Flanagan replied, "I don't know, but if you go to see Mrs O'Toole,
      she'll know what to do."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs  Flanagan then went down the road to Mrs O'Toole's and returned a
      few minutes later with her cloths torn, a black eye, bruises all over
      her body, and her hair tangled like a birds nest.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A  shocked  Mr Flanagan gasped, "Jesus, Mary and Joseph, woman!  What
      happened to ye?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "I  went  to  see Mrs O'Toole and asked her what a urine specimen is,
      and  she  said, "Piss in a bottle, woman." So I said, "Go shit in yer
      hat!, .. and the fight was on."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A young female teacher was giving an assignment to her Grade 6 class,
      one day.  It was a large assignment so she started writing high up on
      the  chalkboard.  Suddenly there was a giggle from one of the boys in
      the class.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She  quickly  turned  and asked, "what's so funny Pat?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well  teacher,  I  just  saw  one  of  your garters."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Get  out  of  my classroom," she yells, "I don't want to see you for
      three days."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  teacher  returns to the chalkboard.  Realising she had forgotten
      to  title  the  assignment;  she  reaches  to  the  very  top  of the
      chalkboard.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Suddenly there is even a louder giggle from another student.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She quickly turns and asks, "What's so funny Billy?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Well miss, I just saw the tops of your stockings."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> This time the punishment is more severe, "I don't want to see you for
      three weeks, get out of my classroom."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Embarrassed  and  frustrated,  she  drops  the  eraser when she turns
      around  again.  So she bends over to pick it up.  This time she hears
      a  burst  of  laughter  from Johnny.  She quickly turns to see Johnny
      leaving the classroom.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Where do you think you are going?" she asks Johnny?</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Well teacher, from what I just saw, my school days are over."</P>
