      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two  members  of  GAUG went to Huddersfield this  year.   We  were
      driven  there by an Amiga owner from Aberdeenshire.  As you  might
      imagine  he had to drive rather a long way to get there  and  back
      (about 1000 miles by my reckoning)!  The trip down to Huddersfield
      was  rather  interesting as we climbed into the  Southern  Uplands
      and later the Peak District.  We ran into a lot of snow,  some  in
      the  air  and  some  on  the ground.  Despite several  jack-knifed
      lorries  and  a lot of crashed cars we got to a village  south  of
      Manchester where we picked up an additional passenger.  We finally
      arrived  at the show exactly half an hour late and our driver  and
      other passenger set up their table.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  show this year was spread over three floors taking up  nearly
      the  entire  building.  The retailers such as  Eyetech  and  Weird
      Science  were  in  the basement and the User Groups  were  on  the
      first floor.  Several workshops were run during the day in a small
      room on the second floor.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plenty  of  user groups were there including SEAL,  ANT  and  BAC.
      There  were  also  numerous retailers such as Kicksoft,   Forematt
      Home Computing, Cloanto and Classic Amiga.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  spread of people and exhibitors around the building  made  it
      more  difficult to estimate a head count but there didn't seem  to
      be  as  many  people  there  as  last  year  although  there  were
      certainly more exhibitors.  Eyetech came with a massive amount  of
      cardboard  boxes and seemd to be emptying them as  the  show  went
      on.   There wasn't the same squash around their stand  however  as
      there was the last time.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  user groups were running various impressive systems including
      an  Amiga in a blue metal box with a door on the front and a power
      switch  on  top.  To pack it up you just unplugged the wires  from
      their sockets, closed the door and walked away!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Games  like  Earth 2140,  Simon the Sorcerer and Descent:Freespace
      were  all  available to view or play plus the obligatory  Sensible
      Soccer  tournament.   Several   user  group  magazines  were  also
      available to buy although,  perhaps unsurprisingly,  there was  no
      sign of Digital magazine anywhere.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  machine  which just had to be mentioned was  an  A1200  in  a
      Power  Tower  with   a   massive   specification.    Everyone  was
      flabbergasted  when  they  saw what was  running  on  its  monitor
      especially when we found out it had nothing faster  than  an  '060
      in  it.   The  specification included a Voodoo  3  graphics  card,
      Soundblaster sound card,  CD-Writer and a TV card.  The owner  had
      plugged  a  Playstation2 running Grand Theft Auto 3  into  the  TV
      card  and  had  it  running  as  a   backdrop  to  Worbench  while
      simultaneously running Freespace in a window and  burning  CDs  to
      stop himself getting bored!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately,   there was no sign of Fleecy  this  year  although
      ZeoNeo  were  present  showing their  Shoot-Em-Up  'PlanetZed'  on
      various  computers including a Compaq I-Paq PDA.  A  Sharp  Zaurus
      running Intent was was also available to view.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Probably the most exciting thing at the show was a tower with  the
      cover off and a sheet of perspex covering the space instead.   The
      tower  which  was at a corner of Eyetech's stand had only  cleared
      customs that morning and contained an AmigaOne board.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alan  Redhouse  (MD  of  Eyetech)  gave a presentation  about  the
      AmigaOne during the afternoon.  Most people seemed to be expecting
      something  similar to last year and announcements of more  delays,
      but  Alan had something different in mind.  He ran down a list  of
      questions   or   complaints   about   the   previously   announced
      specification of the AmigaOne and covered each point in turn.  The
      best news of the presenttation was that the AmigaOne board in  the
      tower  wasn't just another prototype but was in fact a  production
      board!   The  AmigaOne is finished and is ready to  ship  whenever
      OS4.0  is  released.  The specification has improved substantially
      on  what  was  there  before and appears  to  have  answered  most
      AmigaOne critics.  The price was a nice surprise too at only  £350
      for an entry-level system which has a G3 running at 600Mhz and  up
      to 2Gb of SDRAM.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  all  left  the  show a lot happier than we had  been  when  we
      arrived  and  began our mammoth journey home.  After dropping  off
      our  passenger south of Manchester we headed northwards,  the snow
      having  melted off the roads during the day.  We arrived  back  in
      Glasgow  about 11 o'clock with more things than  we  had  when  we
      left but a lot less money.</P>
