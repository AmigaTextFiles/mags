     <font color=white> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Q) <font color=aqua> Vulcan Software was set up to release the first in the series
      of the Valhalla Games,  Obviously the name Vulcan and the fact you
      did use the Quote "Live long and Prosper" would indicate that  one
      of  you are strong "Trekkie" fans.  Spill the Beans<font color=white> :)<font color=aqua>  Is it you,
      Lisa or both?</font></font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)<font color=yellow>  Yes, Vulcan was established in 1994 to release our very first
      game Valhalla & The Lord of Infinity for the Amiga.  At that  time
      we  had  no idea it would be the first Valhalla game in a  series.
      We  primarily  chose the name Vulcan based on  the  Greek  God  of
      fire,   the  metal forger.  But it is true that both  myself  (and
      Lisa)  are Trekkies<font color=white> :)<font color=yellow> And over time, as we adopted a more logical
      approach  to  running  a software development/publishing  company,
      our  identity geared itself more towards the Trekkie reference  to
      Vulcan.  Although our company logo still remains, as the symbol of
      a hammer head, hitting an anvil, creating sparks.</font></font></font></P><font color=yellow><font color=white><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>  When the first instalment of Valhalla (Lord of Infinity)  was
      released the Magazine Games reviewers,  Could not seem to make  up
      their  minds,   I have seen VERY Low review scores and  reasonably
      high ones.  Did this bother you or did you have complete faith  in
      the Valhalla series?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>  Don't forget this was our very first game,  it was created in
      12  weeks and written in Amos!  So we had no idea of how it  would
      be received by the magazine press,  let alone that they would even
      contemplate  reviewing it.  It did have one thing in  it's  favour
      and  that  was,   it was the first ever speech adventure  for  the
      Amiga.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It  was a new and exciting time for us,  I remember going into  my
      local  computer  shop on the day of release and seeing  the  boxed
      game on the shelf and thinking 'wow',  simply that,  'wow' as  I'm
      sure  all  developers of commercial product say,  the  first  time
      they see their baby on display.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon  after  we  had  a visit from one of the Amiga  magazines  (I
      think it was CU Amiga)  and they fell in love with it,  giving  us
      rave  reviews  and  a  90% score.  Soon we  had  cover  disks  and
      magazine reviews and another magazine (Amiga Action)  went  a  bit
      loopy  giving it 94%,  sales went crazy and we where soon  on  the
      Saturday morning television shows promoting the game  and  in  the
      daily newspapers.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the funniest thing happened,  the magazine called Amiga Power
      (which I always loved)  gave it a score of 14% and hated  it!   It
      was  such a strange thing,  as our publicity was from one  extreme
      to the other.  This in turn actually did us a great favour,  as we
      had so much publicity around the drastic reviews from one magazine
      to the next.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  saying,  'all publicity is good publicity' actually came true
      for  Vulcan and our sales achieved the retail best buy awards  for
      that  year.   So  looking back I think the  diversity  of  opinion
      helped our cause and made Valhalla a bit like Marmite (you  either
      hated it or loved it).</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   When you released the second game Valhalla  Before The  War,
      you  actually  took  the story back in time  (To  before  Lord  of
      Infinity).  In reality, If you wanted to play Valhalla in sequence
      You  would have to play 2-1-3.  Was there a reason for this? i.e..
      Did you not really plan for a forward sequel.</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>  Actually they should be played in order 1,  2 then 3 to fully
      understand the plot.  We hadn't set out to make the Valhalla games
      as  a  series,  but the sequel was the most logical step  for  us,
      based on the success of the first one.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the first game you played the cute little prince who was going
      to  kill  the evil Lord of Infinity who stole the crown  form  the
      little princes father (the true King of Valhalla).  So your  quest
      was one of revenge and justice.  In the fourth level of this first
      game  the  little prince meets the Lord of Infinity and we  always
      thought  that  his character was so colourful and  interesting  in
      his final death scene.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  when faced with developing a sequel,  we knew we just  had  to
      use the Lord of Infinity as the main character..  but..  erm .. he
      was  killed in the first game!  So our only choice was to go  back
      in  time  and  explain  how this evil  person  came  to  kill  the
      original King and take the throne,  and so that was your quest  in
      the second game.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It  actually turned out well,  as you went from playing a cute do-
      gooder (in the first game)  to playing an evil twisted and  grumpy
      character (in the second game).</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   After  Valhalla 1 and 2 had  been released ..You  must  have
      realized that the Games had developed a "Cult" following.  However
      for  the  Third game in the series (Fortress of Eve)  you  changed
      from the Dark gloomy,  Mysterious top down format, To a More (dare
      I say it<font color=white> :) <font color=aqua> Bright cartoonish side-on format. Why change what had
      been a roaring Success?</font></font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A) <font color=yellow>  Cult  following indeed,  we actually went on to  make  other
      Amiga games (after the second Valhalla game)  namely Hillsea  Lido
      and  Timekeepers but all that time we were inundated with requests
      for  the next Valhalla instalment and so it soon became clear that
      there was a cult following that had to be fed.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  did change the layout of Valhalla & The Fortress of Eve mainly
      as a technical improvement over the first two games,  this time we
      changed  the angle slightly as it allowed us to show  more  detail
      of the world and objects,  as well as offer new puzzles that would
      have been impossible when looking over head.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This  game was more light hearted than the first two as your quest
      was  to  find  and  marry a princess and so we opted  for  a  more
      colourful and clean approach to the graphics,  I agree though,  it
      did turn out more cartoony than the first two,  but just like  the
      original magazine reviews,  we had fans saying,  'I love  the  new
      presentation',  or 'I hate the new presentation',  there was no in
      between<font color=white> :)</font></P><font color=white>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   After releasing Valhalla  1&2 you introduced the MiniSeries,
      However  soon afterwards you announced that you would be producing
      CD-ROM games only called the MegaSeries.  At this point in time  a
      lot  of  Amiga  users had not upgraded their machines.   Was  this
      decision taken to<font color=white> (a)<font color=aqua>  Allow you to produce better games<font color=white> (b)<font color=aqua>   To
      combat Piracy<font color=white> (c)<font color=aqua>  or an Indication that you were frustrated  with
      the Amiga users who failed to upgrade their machines?</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua><font color=white><font color=aqua> 

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>   The  MiniSeries was created to make all of our Amiga  floppy
      games part of a set,  an identity if you like for Vulcan products,
      it  was  also a way to offer Amiga users cheaper games.   At  this
      time,   from  1994  through  to 1997  the  decline  of  the  Amiga
      (commercially)  was making itself know. Fewer shops where stocking
      Amiga  games  and Amiga magazines were closing all  around  whilst
      Amiga  users flooded to PC.  It was virtually impossible  to  sell
      'full sized' boxed games in the shops and make a living.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vulcan's solution was to reduce the box size (to about  one  third
      in  size)  and manufacture,  duplicate and print our own  products
      which  we would specifically sell through mail order (at half  the
      price)  and supply bulk units through wholesale and retail  around
      the world.  We balanced this for a while, for example for every UK
      buying  public we lost,  we then gained one in Germany  or  France
      etc.   So  we  survived whilst all around failed and  went  on  to
      produce 10 titles in the MiniSeries.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> But  we  knew at that time that there was no way we could  compete
      with  the  superior PC CD products coming out.  It  was  for  this
      reason (and this reason only)  that we decided to switch to  Amiga
      CD  development.  We had in the back of our minds  that  if  Amiga
      games  could  offer similar experiences as PC CD's then  we  might
      have a future.  At this time,  we really believed Amiga would find
      a new owner and once again be supported at the hardware level.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Piracy was never an issue for us,  it exists and that is that,  if
      you use pirated products then you were probably never the type  of
      person to go and buy the product in the first place,  and so lower
      sales  is  not  attributed to Piracy,  but simply that  there  are
      fewer honest people around who see the bigger picture.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Our  switch  to  Amiga  CD  allowed  us  to  offer  multi-language
      products,  with superior sound,  graphics and animation's,  it was
      brave  as  hardly  any  Amiga user had a CD  drive.   Yes  it  was
      frustrating that not everyone upgraded to Amiga  CD  but  I  don't
      blame  them as the CD units available at that time were over  £120
      compared to a PC CD for around £40!  However,  the hard-core Amiga
      users did upgrade (for which I greatly admired),  there was a core
      of  dedicated users,  committed to the Amiga who would do anything
      to help it's future.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Q)<font color=aqua>   Vulcan quickly became the Main  developer of Amiga Software,
      and  you  appeared  to  have  some   interesting  Titles  awaiting
      release.   However You made the shock Announcement that  you  were
      scaling down Amiga Developments and moving to the PC platform.   A
      brave move considering you were entering a market where you  would
      be  virtually  unknown  and  facing   the  Big  multi  Millionaire
      developers. Have you ever regretted this?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>   Regretted?  I regretted the fact that Amiga  never  found  a
      company to bring it back to life (when it so desperately needed  a
      new heart),  it was given life support a few times, but in the end
      it  was  all too apparent that it's time had come.  Far  too  many
      users  had left the platform,  far too many developers had  turned
      to  greener pastures,  far too many retailers closed and  far  too
      many magazines folded. In the end it was futile.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All I can say now is that Vulcan tried to do its bit.  We ended up
      producing 5 MegaSeries Amiga CD titles and the last  one  in  1998
      called  Genetic Species (by Marble Eyes)  was  an  insight  as  to
      where  Amiga games was heading and how great an Amiga  game  could
      be!  GS supported 14 languages but when you counted how many Amiga
      buying  users remained (throughout the entire world)  it  was  sad
      indeed,  so much so that we never recovered from GS and the  debts
      it left behind.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vulcan moving to PC was one of two options,  the first option  was
      to  close  Vulcan and get that job at the food  store <font color=white> :) <font color=yellow> Not  a
      pretty  thought!  So we stopped all Amiga development,   sold  our
      remaining Amiga hardware and bought a PC and a C++ compiler.   Yes
      it  was scary!  January 1999 Vulcan (now 5 years old)  entered  PC
      development with no PC development experience and no money!   It's
      your worst nightmare scenario!</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=yellow>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> But no, I haven't regretted the move, it's a challenge.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Q)<font color=aqua>  You faced a lot of savage and  generally undeserved criticism
      when  you  left  Amiga,   that  must  have  hurt.   Any  lingering
      resentment to the critics?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>  I don't hold any resentment towards anyone.  Yes we got allot
      of  criticism,   but  it was normally based upon  the  individuals
      passion to see the Amiga succeed,  I too shared that passion,  and
      so  knew where they were coming from.  Having said that,   we  did
      also  receive allot of praise 'and thanks' for our efforts,  which
      was  really nice,  as it meant people where aware of our  struggle
      and our efforts to make it all work.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  only thing that really got my back up was when someone  would
      criticize  us for leaving,  and to then find out that  they  never
      once bought any of our products.<font color=white> :0</font></P><font color=white>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>  Recently you  uploaded the Full "Genetic Species" game to the
      Aminet.  Was this really a farewell Present to the Amiga users  or
      were you just fed up of the Pirates copying the Game?</font></P><font color=aqua> 

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)  <font color=yellow>Purely a farewell present to any remaining Amiga  users  out
      there,   not just Genetic Species but all of our old  Amiga  games
      are  slowly  being  released  on  the  Vulcan  website  (for  free
      download).</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">(Q)<font color=aqua>   Will  Genetic Species ,  or a similar type game be  released
      for P.C.?</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)<font color=yellow> Vulcan  have  no plans to make a PC version of Genetic Species
      but  if  one  was  ever initiated it would be  from  the  original
      development team (Marble Eyes),  however,  I am aware that a  Game
      Boy Advance version is in the first stages of conception.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> (Q) <font color=aqua>  It's obvious from past Interviews/statements that you  were
      once very dedicated to the Amiga Computer ...Do you</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">(1)<font color=aqua> Still own an Amiga (even if it gathers dust in the Loft :)</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)<font color=yellow>  No,  all our Amiga's were either sold or thrown away.   I  do
      however still have the Amiga external CD drive I bought  for  £120
      but  would  you  believe that only yesterday it  stopped  working!
      Spooky!</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> (2)<font color=aqua>  Still take an Interest in developments in the Amiga (if there
      is any)</font></P><font color=aqua> 

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>  I did take an interest for the first year on leaving but soon
      grew  tired of the same old press releases about what  the  future
      may  bring,   and I never saw any evidence of the future  bringing
      anything but suspended faith and diminishing hope.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">(3)<font color=aqua>  Do you have any comments regarding the Development of the New
      Amiga OS or AmigaOne machine.</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> (A)<font color=yellow> No.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>  Having recently downloaded your "Vulcan Portal" I must say, I
      do  like the idea behind it,  A sort of interactive/Digital speech
      equipped FTP program for your Web site. What gave you this Idea ?</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)<font color=yellow>  The Idea behind the Vulcan Portal, Wow, this is a complicated
      one to explain!  It kind of evolved.  Originally the Vulcan Portal
      was going to be a simple downloading program that would eventually
      download our new PC products (in episodes)  to the users computer.
      A digital distribution application. But we simply didn't know when
      to stop developing this application. (and still don't).</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  important to note that when we started developing the Vulcan
      Portal in February 2001 we had just spent 2 years developing  some
      pretty  fancy  3d game development tools (called Mother3d)   along
      with  runtime engines,  you know the kind of 3d that  can  animate
      skin'able 3d characters in real-time.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First  tests of the Vulcan Portal allowed the user to  download  a
      test  file,   and a requester box came up saying,  "you  have  the
      file"  or "something's gone wrong",  not inspiring and very  dull!
      After staring at our computers for a few days we thought it  would
      be  kind of cool to remove those silly requester boxes and replace
      them  all  with a real time 3d character,  one that could,   move,
      smile,  blink and speak, putting a human face on the functionality
      of the Vulcan Portal.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  a  few  months we had successfully integrated our  Mother3d
      technology  into  this  application and the  results  where  quite
      remarkable.   The Vulcan Portal was now fronted  by  real-time  3d
      characters,  who synthetically spoke (in six languages),  allowing
      them  to report on all downloading operations,  advise of problems
      and  offer  information about itself.  Needless  to  say  we  soon
      realized  that  the  Vulcan Portal  could  be  more  than  just  a
      downloading tool.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In it's current state (version 210),  the Vulcan Portal allows its
      users  to define how they virtually look in 3d,  with customizable
      skins  and speech preferences,  and they can upload themselves  to
      the  Vulcan  Orbiter,  where they can meet all other Portal  users
      and  engage  in  communication by sending each other  3dVoiceMail,
      (like email but the text of the mail is spoken by a '3d you'  with
      perfect  lip  synch  on the receiving computer),   they  can  also
      collect  daily 3dVoiceNews about Vulcan's developments  and  daily
      PC  and console gaming news (supplied by Ferrago.co.uk)  which  is
      spoken to them by a 3d news reader.  Oh and of course download our
      application and games.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  in all it's turned out to be a community building application
      around  Vulcan  and  our  products,  we  call  it  a  'gateway  to
      everything Vulcan'.  It's a tool,  that allows you to download and
      play  our products but also comes with a whole community of  other
      Vulcan game players,  offering an entertaining and remarkable  way
      of communication.  It's also an evolving application,  meaning  it
      upgrades  to  new version 'automatically' (about  twice  a  month)
      allowing it to expand with new services and features.  The feature
      we are currently working on is real-time 3dVoiceChat.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   You  are currently porting the original  Valhalla  games  to
      work  on  the PC via the Portal ...Do you have any plans  to  port
      other  original  Vulcan  games to the  PC  (like  Timekeepers  ...
      Please  pretty please ...My wife is holding a rolling  pin  to  my
      head<font color=white>  :) </font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=white>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>  Due to popular request we have indeed started to convert  our
      old Valhalla speech adventure games to PC,  we've called them  the
      Valhalla Classics and they comprise of 12 episodes,  each  episode
      is  downloaded  (you  guessed   it)   through  the  Vulcan  Portal
      application  (approx.  6Mb per episode)  but remarkably  they  are
      also played within the very same application.</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  PC  versions witness some major graphic enhancements (now  we
      have  allot more than 32 colours to play with)  and  we  have  re-
      written  some  of  the puzzles and trebled the amount  of  digital
      speech,  however we have tried to keep the spirit of the  original
      Amiga  Valhalla games intact within the PC versions of  this  cult
      speech adventure.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Timekeepers? Laugh out loud,  yes we do have plans to also convert
      Timekeepers to PC,  once again to be downloaded and played  within
      the Vulcan Portal,  but only because of people like your wife  who
      confront us with rolling pins all the time. <font color=white>:) </font></P><font color=white>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Q) <font color=aqua>  Each  episode  of  the   Valhalla  Classics  Games  can  be
      downloaded  for  the small sum of £2.50 ..Making  each  game  cost
      £10.   Surely at this you will not recover the costs of  reworking
      the games,  Or is it your hope to capture the attentions of the Ex
      Amiga  users upgrading to PC ?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A) <font color=yellow>  The  first episode of the Valhalla Classics (The Crypt)   is
      free  (as  is the Vulcan Portal).  Episodes 2 to 12 are priced  at
      £2.50  each  (approx.   $3.60).  The main  reason  for  doing  the
      conversions  is  to  preserve  the Valhalla  brand  'identity'  by
      placing them on a mainstream platform,  and at the same time build
      up  a  Portal community in preparation for our flagship  PC  title
      Valhalla  3D The Curse Of Infinity,  which we have been developing
      for 3 years.</font></P><font color=yellow> 

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  actual conversion of the Valhalla Classics is more of a hobby
      which we do in our spare time,  the end result is the preservation
      of  this  cult game,  and cheap 'accessible' fun,  for anyone  who
      gets  hooked.   With  regards to recovering costs,   don't  forget
      digital  distribution means no manufacturing  costs  (box,   CD's,
      manuals)   and  no  middle  men  fees (distributors,   publishers,
      retailers)   the end result is the ability to  offer  games  at  a
      really  cheap  price to the user and still (as a developer)   make
      the same (if not more) unit revenue per title if published through
      normal  retail channels.  In my mind digital distribution  is  the
      future.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Q) <font color=aqua> I see that with the Vulcan Portal,  your Mother3d technology
      and  the other tools,  Vulcan can now be seen as more than just  a
      games  developer,  is this an area you see as important for Vulcan
      to  enter? </font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>   We  started  as  a games developer in  1994  and  still  are
      'primarily' a games developer,  but we have also diversified  into
      other technologies,  this we believe is very important and will be
      the key to our successful transition from Amiga to PC.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We  have some excellent intellectual properties (based on our back
      catalogue)  but now after 3 years of PC development we  also  have
      some  pretty exciting technology assets.  Things like our  digital
      distribution   technology,    speech   technology,     3dVoiceNews
      technology,   Ebayer  (used within  auction  on  Ebay)   and  most
      importantly  our  Mother3d technology that  allows  us  to  create
      advanced high end specification real-time 3d games,  complete with
      modelling and animation tools.  We are really just coming  to  the
      beginning of what our future holds.</P>

    <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  (Q)<font color=aqua>   Is it intended to sell forthcoming Vulcan Titles  ONLY  via
      the  Vulcan Portal or will we,  again see Vulcan titles  available
      on  store  shelves?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>   Our emphasis at present is on digital distribution  via  the
      Vulcan  Portal.  We believe that you will begin to see  many  more
      developers and publishers turning to this delivery method  in  the
      coming  months/years.   Based on users  internet  access  becoming
      faster  and  cheaper  and  also on the  massive  price  reductions
      achievable for end product that generate similar revenue  streams.
      However  we will still explore standard publishing routes  of  our
      products  when the right publishing partner comes into  focus  and
      it is something that doesn't detract form our main strategy.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   The  Portals website states that the Portal is an  evolving
      system,   any  timeframe  on  when the  WinAmp  conflict  will  be
      resolved or when we can use true colour? I do like Winamp<font color=white>  :-)</font></font></P><font color=aqua><font color=white>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A)<font color=yellow>   Evolving application,  yes the Vulcan Portal upgrades (about
      twice  a  month)  to new versions that cater for new features  and
      improvements.</font></P><font color=yellow>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The winAmp conflict is already fixed,  it actually comes down to a
      setting  within winAmp based on how it should use DirectSound  and
      your  sound  card.  This then allows it to share your  sound  card
      with  the Vulcan Portal,  providing you have also configured  your
      Portal to share the sound card via a medium co-operation level.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Portal  and  Valhalla  Classics do  currently  support  (true
      colour)   which  is16bit and also 24 and 32bit display  modes.   I
      think  what you are referring to is the actual 3d element  of  the
      Portal which currently requires a Zbuffer on your graphics card.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Most  graphics cards only support 16bit Zbuffers and  as  the  bit
      depth  of your display mode needs to match the bit depth  of  your
      Zbuffer,  it means that on most graphics cards,  3d  can  only  be
      enabled  in  a 16bit display mode.  However we will  soon  have  a
      Portal  version  that requires no Zbuffer and therefore  will  run
      the 3d element of the Portal at all bit depths.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   I  normally use a 1280 x1024  screen res,  so the Portal  is
      rather  small  on my desktop,  will we be able to "scale"  up  the
      Portal  or use a custom screen for it?</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (A) <font color=yellow>  At present we don't have plans for that,  however the Portal
      does  get bigger as we expand it for newer features,  (you  should
      have  seen the size of it when it was first released! <font color=white> :) <font color=yellow> )  It's
      focus  is  to  be a desktop application and as people  still  have
      desktop sizes of 800x600,  1024x768 we have struck a happy balance
      for the size of the Portal.  Funny thing is,  some old Amiga users
      commented  on  how small the Valhalla Classics  seemed  to  be  on
      their PC and they are always amazed to hear that the graphics  are
      the  exact same size as they where on their Amiga versions of  the
      game.   It's  just the Amiga used to run in 320x256 and  therefore
      seemed  huge  compared to the display capabilities of  PC  graphic
      cards and monitors.</font></font></font></P><font color=yellow><font color=white><font color=yellow>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Q)<font color=aqua>   You  are  currently developing Valhalla 3D  ( The  Curse  of
      Infinity),  Many game companies on the PC seem to be  moving  away
      from  the  Mouse  controlled "Point &  click"  type  of  Adventure
      games,  Relying on complicated keyboard controls ( I seem to spend
      more  time  trying to figure out which keys to press  rather  than
      solve the Puzzles on hand)  What are you plans for the controls in
      Valhalla 3D?</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(A)<font color=yellow>   Valhalla 3D (still in development)  is not a point  &  click
      type of adventure,  it is an advanced first person perspective  3d
      adventure,  simply imagine a popular 3d fps shooter but trading in
      your  guns for your hands and using your brain instead of weapons,
      our blurb is as follows<font color=white>:</font></font></P><font color=yellow><font color=white>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Prepare  to  be  thrown  into  a  world  of  lateral  and  logical
      thinking,   shrouded  in   suspense,    intrigue  and  atmospheric
      diversion.   This first person 3d speech adventure will  captivate
      your  imagination offering true world physics and total  immersion
      into  confined locations.  No more running around bland  locations
      looking  for the exit,  this 3d technology focuses on  the  inward
      infinite,  creating a world that is hard to leave and even  harder
      to forget.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> ...But yes I agree with you about controls of recent games and  we
      have  spent a great deal of thought on this for Valhalla  3D.   We
      have  come up with something that we are really proud of  and  you
      will  find  yourself manipulating many objects  and  environments,
      achieving  complicated   interaction   and   manoeuvring  and  all
      accomplished with your mouse and two mouse buttons.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  goal  we  are aiming for is to allow anyone to instantly  get
      into  the  game and play the game with out requiring any  previous
      reading  or  knowledge  on   how   to  control  the  character  or
      manipulate  his environment,  it's still early days  but  I  think
      we've  cracked it after many months of testing and thinking  about
      the input method.</P>
