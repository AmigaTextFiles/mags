<font color=aqua><CENTER>Sunday 9th September 2001 - the day my
life changed forever!</CENTER>
<P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  many  years I have wanted to live
in  Orkney.  I intended to go in 2002,
but  recent  events in my life brought
that forward by a year.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1992 I have been engaged in a long running battle with 
  my eldest son regarding my house in Glossop. This was finally scheduled to go 
  to Court on 29th June 2001, and my younger son suddenly changed his stance and 
  decided to proceed along the same lines as his elder brother. According to the 
  barristers involved in the case, this meant I had very little chance of achieving 
  success, and I lost my Legal Aid. The many years of stress began to get to me 
  - I became very depressed, could not sleep more than a few hours a night, and 
  began to neglect my diet. Two days before the case was due to go to Court, when 
  my younger son was being completely unreasonable and refusing to understand 
  the cause of my distress, I telephoned The Samaritans and sobbed my heart out 
  to them for about two hours, then cried myself to sleep. In the morning I decided 
  I was not prepared to put up with any more stress and uncertainty. If I was 
  to lose my home I had to make plans immediately. I telephoned Orkney Islands 
  Council, who put me in touch with various other organisations, and suggested 
  I put an advert in The Orcadian newspaper. I telephoned a friend to ask if she 
  could send me her copy of The Orcadian, and she suggested contacting the Tourist 
  Board regarding out of season short lets. I hadn't thought of this, and suddenly 
  it seemed like the perfect answer. I grabbed my copy of the Orkney Islands brochure, 
  and telephoned a number under the self-catering section. She didn't offer winter 
  lets, but told me who did, and I began to go through the list. This wasn't very 
  successful, and rather disheartened I tried one she hadn't mentioned. Someone 
  up there must have been looking out for me, because the 'phone was answered 
  by Giffie Leslie, who is now my landlord. The top floor flat in his Victorian 
  Craigiefield House is my home until 31st May 2002.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was  difficult  to go to Court the
following  day,  knowing that whatever
transpired I would be living in Orkney
in a little over two months.  The case
was adjourned, and I panicked, but the
date  for the next hearing was set for
6th August.  I took the opportunity to
appeal  against  the  withdrawal of my
Legal  Aid.   The  appeal could not be
heard  until at least 14th August, and
so    I    applied   for   a   further
adjournment,  and  this  was  granted.
The   new   date   was   29th  August.
However,  the  stress was beginning to
get  to me again, and before my appeal
I   developed   Bell's   Palsy.   This
unpleasant      affliction     further
destroyed my self confidence, and when
my  appeal was refused I went to Court
with  much  foreboding.   I  was  very
surprised  to  find  that my elder son
had   not   attended  the  Court,  and
neither  had  his  barrister,  but the
solicitor and barrister for my younger
son  were  there.  The judge took some
time  to  backtrack through the events
of  the  case  so far, and I sat there
next  to  my younger son's barrister -
who  I have nicknamed Verbal Diarrhoea
- feeling rather dispirited.  Suddenly
the  judge ended his diatribe and said
"I  therefore  find  in  Mrs.  Danby's
favour.    I   award  her  a  lifetime
interest   in  the  house."  This  was
exactly  what  I  wanted, but I was so
stunned I even forgot to look pleased.
He  went  on to say that half my costs
were  also  to  be paid by my two sons
out  of  their  share of the property.
Although   legally   this  is  only  a
partial  victory  for me, literally it
is  an  outright  win,  because it now
means my two sons will have to pay out
more  money  than  they  have actually
gained as their share of the property.
After  all  the years that had passed,
the  stress  and the tremendous amount
of  money which had been wasted during
this  case,  I  had won.  I didn't get
everything  I  had wanted - but enough
to satisfy me.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  plans  for  going  to  Orkney were
under  way,  but it had been difficult
to  get everything together in secret.
Now  I could tell my younger son I was
leaving  -  and he didn't believe me!!
There      was     bitterness,     and
recriminations,   but   eventually  he
began   to   accept  it,  and  on  8th
September  my  friend  arrived to load
everything   into  the  van  ready  to
depart  the  following  day.  I didn't
get any sleep that night, as I was too
busy  messing  around trying to ensure
everything I needed was ready to pack.
I was practically sleep walking in the
morning  when  we  began  to  put  the
remainder  of the things into the van.
We   eventually  departed,  two  hours
later  than  we  had  intended,  and I
heaved  a  sigh  of  relief  -  I  was
leaving  the place which had been like
a  prison  to  me  for  the  last nine
years.  I was on my way to my new life
in my beloved Orkney!!</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  journey was uneventful at first -
over the Woodhead road and onto the M1
to   Durham   and   the  outskirts  of
Newcastle.  We stopped on the motorway
near  here  for  a late breakfast.  We
stayed   for   some   time   at  South
Queensferry,   whilst  Ian  took  some
photographs  of the railway bridge.  I
had   eaten   in   a   small  cafe  in
Inverkeithing,  on  the  north side of
the Forth road bridge, many years ago,
and  I  wanted  to  find it again.  It
didn't exist - well, it was about 1964
when  I  had  eaten  there, so perhaps
it's  not surprising!!  By the time we
had  decided  on  an  alternative, and
eaten  our food sitting in the van, we
were  very late leaving Inverkeithing.
We  had  booked  bed  and breakfast in
Muir   of   Ord,  and  had  told  Mrs.
MacKenzie  we  would  be  there  about
18.00.   With about 200 miles still to
cover  it  was  almost 17.00.  If ever
there  was  a  time when we could have
done  with  a  motorway, that time was
now  -  and  we  had  to negotiate the
twists   and  turns  of  the  tourist-
infested A9.  We eventually arrived on
the    outskirts   of   Inverness   at
approximately  19.00  and then Muir of
Ord  about  three  quarters of an hour
later.   We telephoned Mrs.  MacKenzie
and  she  and  her husband came out to
meet   us   and   lead   us  to  their
delightful house.  It's fortunate they
did,  otherwise  we  would  never have
found  it  in the dark.  It was almost
22.00  by  the  time  we  arrived, and
after  a cup of tea and a light supper
we fell into bed exhausted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It   was   good   to  take  time  over
breakfast  the  following morning, but
we overdid it a little, and instead of
it  being  09.30  when we left Muir of
Ord  it  was  10.30.  We were tootling
along  steadily  until  Ian  spotted a
sign  telling  us  it was 100 miles to
Wick,  and he realized we had about 20
miles  beyond that to travel - instant
panic!   Eventually,  to  pacify him I
used  his mobile 'phone to contact the
ferry  company after we had left Wick.
I  received the reply "You've only got
about  15  miles to go.  You've plenty
of  time." This regardless of the fact
that  it  was now 13.15, and the ferry
was  due  to depart at 13.45 - typical
Orcadian  response!!   We arrived with
about   five  minutes  to  spare,  but
incoming  passengers  were  only  just
leaving the ferry.  It had been rather
misty  on  the  journey  North,  and I
began  to  fear  the  view  of  Orkney
across  the  Pentland  Firth  would be
non-existent.     However,    as    we
approached    Gills    Bay    it   was
beautifully  clear  across  the Firth,
and  with  the  only  mist over Hoy, I
could  pick out every landmark - I was
nearly home.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  had  never  travelled on this ferry
before,  and  it  proved  to be a very
pleasant  journey.   In  just  over an
hour  we  arrived  at  St.   Margarets
Hope.   After  disembarking and taking
more photographs we paid a visit to my
friend  Cindy before making our way to
Kirkwall.   On  arrival  in Kirkwall I
discovered  the  Cathedral  was  still
open,  and of course couldn't resist a
flying  visit.   We  shopped for a few
essentials,  and eventually arrived at
Craigiefield  House at about 18.00.  I
could say we moved everything into the
flat that evening, but that would be a
lie.   We did, however, at least empty
the van and move everything inside the
front  door.  We then decided we would
have something to eat, and whilst this
was  cooking Giffie called and invited
us  into  the  house for a cup of tea.
We spent a pleasant half hour drinking
tea  and  chatting  and then came back
into  the  flat  for our meal.  It was
then  time  to retire - exhausted - at
the  end  of  my  first  day in my new
home.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  following  day  I  showed Ian the
delights   of  Kirkwall  -  first  and
foremost    of   course   my   beloved
Cathedral.   I  had  planned  to visit
three of the North Isles on Wednesday,
Thursday  and  Friday,  but Ian seemed
dismayed when I said the ferry left at
07.20!   On  the  Wednesday  morning I
awoke  at  06.00  to the sound of rain
pattering against the windows, and the
wind  howling  around  the  gables.  I
decided  to  take  the  later ferry to
Westray,  when  hopefully  the weather
would  be better.  It was still rather
wet  at 10.15 when we departed for the
harbour,   but  by  the  time  we  had
arrived in Westray it was much better.
We visited the excellent Sea Transport
Exhibition in the Heritage Centre, and
at  15.00  repaired  to  the Pierowall
Hotel  to  partake of Westray's famous
fish   and  chips.   By  the  time  we
emerged the weather was beautiful, and
we  walked  to the old pier to see the
ferry  arrive  from  Papa  Westray and
then   await  the  transport  back  to
Rapness   for   our  return  ferry  to
Kirkwall.    The   journey   was  very
pleasant and extremely smooth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because  of Ian's aversion to boats, I
changed  the plans for Thursday.  When
we   awoke  to  brilliant  sunshine  I
decided  it  would  be an ideal day to
see  Mainland Orkney.  We travelled to
Birsay  and  took  photographs  of the
Brough, and then journeyed south again
to  Skaill beach and my favourite spot
- the cliffs at Yesnaby.  From here we
visited Stromness, and watched the St.
Ola  arriving.   The final part of the
journey  was via the road skirting the
shores  of  Scapa  Flow.   We  finally
arrived   back  to  the  outskirts  of
Kirkwall  and  made  a brief detour to
the airport before going back home for
tea.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Friday was Eday day.  Eday has been my
favourite  island  ever  since I first
visited  it in 1992.  In my opinion it
has  a  bit  of  everything that makes
Orkney  the  beautiful  place  it is -
some    moorland,   plenty   of   lush
grassland, a couple of sizeable hills,
beautiful   sandstone   cliffs  and  a
number  of excellent beaches.  When we
arrived  on Eday we begged a lift from
a  gentleman  at  the pier, and paid a
visit  to  my  favourite beach - Doomy
Sands.   We  stayed  here  for quite a
while,  eating sandwiches and enjoying
the  solitude.  Eventually we made our
way  back  to  London  Airport  - yes,
really - and telephoned my friend Mrs.
Popp  to  ask  her to pick us up along
the  road.   This she did, and took us
to  Blett,  her home at Carrick Bay at
the  north  end  of the island.  Later
she  returned  us to the pier where we
boarded the Varagen back to Kirkwall.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian  left on Saturday to return south,
and it was good to be alone at last to
appreciate  my  new  home.  During the
weekend  I  tidied  up  and  generally
sorted  out  my  possessions, as I was
expecting  friends  to  visit  on  the
Monday  evening.   At  18.00  I  had a
telephone  call  from my friends.  The
ferry  had been cancelled and they had
hurried  to  Scrabster,  hoping  to be
able  to  catch a ferry from there.  I
reluctantly  had to tell them the last
ferry  had left and they were stranded
there    until   the   morning.    The
following morning the ferry left late,
and   they   eventually   arrived   at
Craigiefield  House at 13.30.  After a
cup  of  tea  we  decided on a revised
itinerary for the day - we would visit
the Tomb of the Eagles and the Italian
Chapel,  and  then pick up the Chinese
takeaway  we  had intended to have the
previous evening.  This proved to be a
very   enjoyable   afternoon,  and  we
enjoyed   the   Chinese  meal  on  our
return.    The  following  morning  at
10.30  we set out to explore the north
and  west Mainland.  I decided a visit
to  the  Cathedral  had to be first on
the  list,  and  instructed  Robert to
turn   into   Kirkwall's   paved  main
street.   He was absolutely terrified,
and  said  "I  feel as if I am driving
through  a  pedestrianised  precinct".
"In   a   way   you  are"  I  replied,
"Pedestrians  have  priority  and  you
drive  very slowly".  To his credit he
managed  it,  but  it  proved  I am no
driver.   Having  instructed Robert to
drive  along  Bridge Street and Albert
Street   to   Broad  Street,  I  later
discovered  that  there  was no access
for cars between 11.00 and 15.00!!  We
rather   hurriedly  left  for  Birsay!
When  we  later  returned from Yesnaby
and  were  deciding  whether  to visit
Stromness  or not, I mentioned that in
Stromness  all the streets were paved.
That  decided it - Robert declined and
decided   we   would   head   back  to
Kirkwall!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing  in  mind  what they say about
the  best  laid  plans - this is where
fate  took  a  hand.  Not content with
the  fiasco the previous evening, when
Robert   and   Karen  arrived  at  St.
Margarets  Hope  they  discovered  the
ferry  had  departed 25 minutes early.
They  made enquiries, made a telephone
call to me, and armed with the promise
of  a  free trip the following morning
they  returned to my top class bed and
breakfast  accommodation for a further
night!!</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  a  week of frenzied activity it
was now time to tie up some loose ends
and  deal  with  some  very  important
tasks.   I  had  to  visit the DSS and
Orkney  Islands  Council.  I needed to
make  an appointment to see my new GP.
I  had  chosen  Dr.  Beaven because he
was  the GP of May MacKay who lives in
Kirkwall  and  also  has  PBC.  I also
needed  to visit the bank and sort out
my  finances.  What finances?  - I was
virtually  penniless,  having spent my
savings  and  everything in my current
account  getting  to  Orkney!  Just to
put  the  top  hat  on things, the DSS
decided    that    until    they   had
confirmation of the position regarding
my  house  in Glossop, they would have
to  suspend  my benefit!  It has taken
some  time  to  sort out this problem,
but  I  am now getting regular benefit
and  beginning  to  pay off some of my
debts.   I  attend  the Sunday morning
service  at  the Cathedral every week,
and  I have met many more people.  The
minister from the Cathedral retired at
the  end of October, and I, along with
about 250 other people from Orkney and
far  and  wide,  attended  a  farewell
social for him.  The home grown talent
was excellent, and so was the food!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  clocks  have  now  gone back, and
winter  is  upon  us.   The  days have
suddenly become very short indeed, and
with  a  change in the wind from South
East   to  North  West,  the  rain  is
lashing  down a lot of the time.  When
I   arrived   here   the  weather  was
unseasonably   excellent.    A  friend
commented   -  "The  weather  up  here
throws  all five seasons at you in the
space of one day.  When people tell me
there are only four seasons, I reply -
ah,  but this is Orkney!" I think that
says  it all.  Despite the fact that I
now  have  to  live  through  the four
darkest months of the year, I am happy
and  certainly have no plans at all to
return   to   what   others  may  call
civilization.    Since   arriving   in
Orkney I am sleeping well, eating well
and   my   health  is  much  improved.
Nowhere  is  perfect,  but  this is as
near to perfection as I wish to get.</P>
