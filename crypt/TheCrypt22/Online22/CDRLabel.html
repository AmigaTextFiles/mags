      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of the most common things to do nowadays is write your own CD's.
      Packages  vary but most people like to customise their labels for the
      disks.   Disk  Creator  comes with a very good Label creator as well,
      but  some  of the other burning packages come with either a very poor
      program for doing this or with nothing at all.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  good thing about the Internet is that there is loads of programs
      available for you to try, and a quick search revealed a small utility
      for printing customised covers for your CD's.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The program is CDR-Label and can be found at<font color=red> http://www.ziplabel.com/</font></P><font color=red>

            <font color=white><CENTER>See Screen Image 1</CENTER><P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  this  is a piece of shareware!!!  The asking price of $15 is not
      particularly exorbitant and it can be registered online, just in case
      you don't want to send money through the mail.</P>



      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So, what does it do?</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, exactly as the name suggests, it makes labels for your CD's.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  download  for  the latest version is under a meg, so not exactly
      time consuming for anyone to do.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The program comes with an installer and theres nothing to
      worry about in getting the program working.</P>

            <font color=white><CENTER>See Screen Image 2</CENTER><P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One  of  the  most  immediate benefits you notice is that the program
      prints  the  front  and back cover on one piece of A4 paper.  This is
      something that Jewel Case Creator on the Disk Creator system could do
      well to copy.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  program  comes with a large help section that details how to use
      the program and helpful hints.  Hints can also be shown while you are
      making the label with its popups.</P>




      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  author also does much the same thing for other types of media by
      having  versions  that  deal with Zip, Jaz, SyQuest, Floppy and LS120
      disks.  Again, these can be downloaded from his site.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  help  section  is  very good and can tell you how to read a disk
      into  your label ...a nice touch and saves a power of typing and file
      extensions  can  be  ignored  or  used.   Sizes  of files can also be
      displayed  if  you wish.  The options for the program are quite good.
      The  failing I noticed quite fast is that it can read audio disks but
      has  no  way to actually access the song titles eg. by way of CDDB or
      any  of  the other sites that database audio disks.  However, you can
      edit the entries to suit yourself, so this failing is repairable.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  the  program  reads  the  disk, you can also decide how deep it
      reads  the directory structure or if you want to only display certain
      types of file.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  it's  the shareware version, you can't do certain things, and one
      of these is that you can't edit the CDR part of the label at the ends
      of the back cover.  A small thing perhaps, this and the nag requestor
      are really all that the author has disabled.</P>


      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  mentioned that the program can print both covers on a single sheet
      of  A4,  but  all  sizes  of paper can be used and there is a printer
      section where you can specify what you want to do.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> You  can change fonts, backgrounds, insert pictures (jpg or bmp only)</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">A quick example like this .....</P>

      <font color=white><CENTER> See Screen Image 3</CENTER> <P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ..... took a few seconds.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can copy your own music CD's labels simply and easily by scanning
      the  covers  and simply inserting the resultant scans onto the labels
      ....like this.</P>

      <font color=white><CENTER>See Screen Image 4</CENTER><P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">A  quick scan of one of my music CD's resulted in this.  An excellent
      CD, by the way :)</P>




<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, I use a portable CD player in the car and I'm loath (after
      losing  quite  a few CD's after the car was broken into) to part with
      my  treasured  sounds  again.   Making  a  copy of a music CD is easy
      enough  and  it keeps the original safe in the house while letting me
      see  what  I'm  playing in the car.  These covers suffice for the car
      easily enough and take a few moments to make.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After  you resize the scans to fit the labels, simply print ....  you
      can  also specify if you want the program to print crop marks to make
      it even easier to cut out the labels.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  labels  are  nicely  sized as well, and I had no problem getting
      them to fit inside the jewel case.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This  is one the fastest programs and easiest to print CD covers.  It
      doesn't  do  CD labels which is a disappointment, but the docs do say
      you  can  mail the author for any improvements you would like to see.
      Maybe a future version .....</P>





      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Data  CD's  are  catered  for with the file name grabbing and you can
      specify  how  many  columns  you  would like your cover to have.  The
      program  also  allows  you to save templates of a particular CD type,
      handy  if you going to use the same format for various types of CD's.
      This also saves fonts, sizes etc, making it easy to have an instantly
      identifiable look to one of your CD's.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  think  that's  enough  information  for  anyone who wants to print
      covers.   If  you don't, you probably didn't bother reading this far.
      If  you  are interested, I expect you are downloading as you read, so
      I'll let you get on with it!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Try it and explore the options.  You might be pleasantly surprised.</P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font>
