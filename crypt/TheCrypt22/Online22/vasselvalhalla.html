     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Aegir:<font color=white>   (or Hler)<font color=aqua>  He is the god of the sea,  and dwells  on  the
      island  of Lessoe (or Hlesey).  He is usually depicted as  an  old
      man  with  a  long white beard.  He is said to trigger storms  and
      tempests and,  on occasion,  even calm the weather.  Aegir is also
      suspected of greed,  often sinking vessels and bringing them  down
      with him to the depths of the ocean.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">Aesir: <font color=aqua> This is the collective name given to the warrior gods  who

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Asgard:<font color=aqua > Of the nine worlds,  this is the world of the Aesir,   or
      the  warrior gods.  In Asgard the gods built their halls,  one  of
      which is Valhalla.</font></P><font color=aqua >

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Audhumla:<font color=aqua > The cow created in the hoar-frost of Ginnungagap.  When
      Audhumla  became  hungry,  she began licking  the  salt  from  the
      sheets of ice.  After continuous licking,  the cow uncovered  from
      the  ice  the  body of Buri,  whose grandsons are the  gods  Odin,
      Vili, and Ve.</font></P><font color=aqua >

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Balder:<font color=aqua >  He  is  the  god  of innocence  and  light,   and  often
      considered to be the most cherished of the Aesir.  He is a son  of
      Odin  and Frigga and the twin brother of Hodur.  Balder is usually
      depicted  as a handsome youth with blue eyes and golden-red  hair,
      which  radiates the beams of the sun and warms the hearts of  men.
      In fact,  everything in the cosmos so loved Balder, that all swore
      to  protect his life.  .  .all except a single sprig of  mistletoe
      growing  on  an oak tree near the gate of Valhalla.  It  was  from
      this  mistletoe that Loki fashioned an arrow,  which  he  gave  to
      Hodur.   A  popular game amongst the gods was to shoot  arrows  at
      Balder,  and knowing full well that nothing could kill him, Balder
      considered  it an exciting sport.  However,  when Hodur  shot  the
      mistletoe  arrow,  it instantly killed Balder and  brought  untold
      grief  upon  the  gods.  The Norse festival  held  on  the  summer
      solstice,  the longest day of the year,  is in honor of Balder. It
      is believed to be the anniversary of his death,  as the sun's rays
      become less warm and the days grow shorter.</font></P><font color=aqua >

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beserker  Rage:<font color=aqua>  At certain times,  Odin was said to give  to  his
      warriors  the gift of beserker rage,  which enabled  the  warrior,
      although weaponless and naked,  to perform great feats of strength
      and valor.</font></P><font color=aqua>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Eastre:<font color=white>  (or Ostara) <font color=aqua> This Saxon goddess is associated with Frigga
      and  is  linked to the resurrection of nature during spring  after
      the  long death of winter.  Eggs were also associated with  Eastre
      because  of  their  symbolic relationship with  the  beginning  of
      life.  It is said that this goddess was so loved,  that the  early
      Christian Northmen refused to abandon the festival of Eastre.  The
      festival in honor of this goddess was combined with the  story  of
      Christ's  resurrection for an easy Christianizing process  of  the
      Northmen,  and the name of Easter survives as a Christian  holiday
      to this day.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ginnungagap:<font color=aqua>  In the Norse creation myth,  this is the name  given
      to  the  massive chasm where fire from Muspellheim  and  ice  from
      Niflheim  fused to bring about life.  This abyss  was  covered  in
      eternal twilight,  and as fire and ice met,  great clouds of steam
      rose  from the chasm.  In time,  the steam froze and created hoar-
      frost which filled Ginnungagap.  The first two creatures to emerge
      in  the  sheets  of hoar-frost in Ginnungagap are  Ymir  (a  frost
      giant) and Audhumla (a cow).</font></P><font color=aqua>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yggdrasill:<font color=white>  (or Yggdrasil)<font color=aqua>  This giant ash tree grows through the
      center of the nine worlds.  It was neither born,  nor will it ever
      die ...  Yggdrasill is eternal and pervades the cosmos.  The fruit
      of  this tree guarantees a harmless childbirth,  and the dew  from
      its  leaves is the sweet nectar from which bees make honey.   High
      in  its  branches it is said lives an eagle,  and  at  its  lowest
      roots  dwells  the dragon Nidhogg.  Upon its trunk,  the  squirrel
      Ratatosk  scampers  from  roots   to   branches  carrying  cryptic
      messages between the dragon and the eagle.  The tree gathers water
      from  three  wells,  one of which is in Asgard and is  called  the
      Well  of  Urd,  another is in Midgard and is called Mimir's  Well,
      and  the  third  is  in Niflheim and is known  as  the  Spring  of
      Hvergelmir.   In  order to learn the wisdom  of  the  dead,   Odin
      willingly suspended himself on Yggdrasill for nine nights,  during
      which time he was pierced in his abdomen by a spear.  Legend  also
      states that upon Ragnarok (the end of the world)  there will be  a
      man  and  a woman,  Lif and Lifthrasir,  who will hide inside  the
      trunk  to survive the devastation.  This couple will bear children
      and begin a new phase in the cycle of man.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      armpit a son and a daughter were born,  and from his feet was born
      the six-headed giant Thrudgelmir.  After Buri is uncovered in  the
      ice of Ginnungagap,  Buri's three grandsons kill Ymir. From Ymir's
      body the nine worlds of the Norse cosmos are made.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>
