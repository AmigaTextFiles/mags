      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Food,  lovely  food.   We all love it and let's face it we can't live
      without  it,  so  by popular request of the lady readers of the Crypt
      magazine we feature a page full of traditional Scottish recipes.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why  Scottish?   Well  because apart from being simply delicious they
      are  plain,  simple  and easy to follow.  All the ingredients will be
      found  in  the  average kitchen.  How many times have you looked at a
      recipe  and  found  out that it requires an unusual herb or an exotic
      ingredient  that  you  not only don't have but can't buy locally.  It
      has happened to me on many an occasion.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  will find something here to suit all tastes and pockets.  One of
      my  favourites  has to be Scotch Broth.  There are many variations of
      this  recipe but for a truly delicious Broth that will "Stick to your
      ribs" you won't go far wrong if you follow this recipe to the letter.
      I did and it's really excellent.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  an  after  dinner  sweet  you  simply have to try the Whisky and
      Chocolate  Crunch, but be careful if your driving as a double helping
      packs  a  real  punch!   Well  folks,  I  have to go now and check my
      Clootie Dumplings.... <font color=yellow> Happy cooking.</font></P><font color=yellow>
