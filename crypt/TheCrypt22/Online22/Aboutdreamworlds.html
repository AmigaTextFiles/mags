                                   <font color=yellow><CENTER>History</CENTER><P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many  years ago (it was the year 1985)  we went the first year  to
      school.  Because both Dirk and us owned the Robotron  Z  1013  (an
      old GDR computer)  we soon became friends and began to torture its
      BASIC  with our little programs...  at that time we were  8  years
      old.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">At that time the first games were written:</P>

      -Death for the Trolls (a bit like BomberMan)<BR>
      -some Jump`n Run`s<BR>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">-and  several  Special-Editions of  existing  Software  (yes,   we
       really coded machine language like FC42A83D...)</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">A  short  time  after Germany united we got a  Amiga500  and  were
      impressed  because of the new possibilities it  offers:   coloured
      pixel graphics,  sound, multitasking and so on. We soon started to
      use AmigaBasic (coded by MicroSoft !!!) and wrote some games like:</P>

      -Wormi and the Black Magic<BR>
      -Gorilla (Amiga version)<BR>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> and  many  other games and tools that vanished when we  bought  an
      A1200  (means  until 1995).  You maybe wonder now about  the  game
      titles ...  but Hey!  We were still childs at this time.  Today we
      would laugh about this games,  but at that time we were very proud
      of it :)</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  the purchase of AMOS Pro 2.0 (about 1994)  began an new  era
      of  programming.   This  time  our first  public  project  arised:
      Crossfire.  But it wasn't the only thing we made, we also did some
      RPGs  like  Genesis of Darkness I (short GoD1)  and its successors
      GoD2 and GoD'96.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It  was  1997  when we finally bought the StormC  package  at  the
      exposition Cologne97 and so we were finally able to  use  all  the
      possibilities  that   our   system   offers  (now  an  A4000  PPC,
      CVisionPPC,  ...).  We wrote (and still write) games like GoD '98,
      YATAG,   Crossfire II,  Between the lines along with many  smaller
      things like 3D engines, screensavers, function tests...</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  June  of  1999 Audun and Simon joined our team to improve  our
      gfx  and  music  abilities.  One year later Sven  came  to  us  to
      strengthen our graphical abilities.</P>


      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  name  'Dreamworlds Development' arised the time we  made  the
      first  plans for 'Between The Lines'.  We soon realized  that  BTL
      (shortened)   and the other projects we plan for  the  future  are
      simply utopic.  If we really make to do them how they are planned,
      they would be a (little)  revolution of computer games,  real  new
      worlds.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  these  games  are  simply impossible,  especially  for  hobby
      coders  as  we  are.   We would try it anyways,  developing  these
      dreams  as far as it is possible for us.  But it will surely  need
      years...</P>
