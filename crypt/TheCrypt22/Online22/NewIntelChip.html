      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SANTA  CLARA,  CALIF.  -- Intel Corp.  introduced its tiniest-ever
      Pentium 4 processors,  as the world's biggest chipmaker revs up  a
      new  manufacturing method that builds faster  products  and  trims
      costs.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  chips use smaller,  0.13 micron wires,  rather than the  0.18
      micron  ones  in  older  products.  These circuits,   1,000  times
      thinner than a human hair,  help semiconductors run faster without
      overheating. The new chips run at 2 gigahertz and 2.2 GHz.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  Santa  Clara,  Calif.,  company is updating its factories  to
      make  the  slimmer  chips,  with four now  equipped  for  the  new
      technique  and two more coming on line this year.  The  processors
      include  twice as much memory as older Pentium 4s  first  sold  in
      November 2000 and are more than 30 percent smaller.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "That  investment is really going to pay off for us,"  Intel  Vice
      President  Louis  Burns said.  "We're at the  beginning  and  just
      beginning to put the gas pedal down."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Intel  will charge $364 each for a 2-GHz chip in 1,000  unit  lots
      and  $562  for a 2.2 GHz model.  The company cut the price  of  an
      older 2GHz chip by 15 percent to $342,  according to its Web site.
      Intel  also added a new chip set that communicates with  the  rest
      of a computer using faster, double-data-rate memory.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Separately,  rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  started selling  a
      faster  version of its flagship chip,  the Athlon XP  2000+.   The
      Sunnyvale,  Calif.,  company said the 1.67 GHz processor  performs
      as well as a 2 GHz Pentium 4.</P>
