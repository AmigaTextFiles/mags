<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was on a cold, calm Winter morning
in  December  1872 when the barque the
Dei  Gratia  spotted the Mary Celeste,
and  sparked  off what must now be one
of  the  best known unsolved mysteries
of  our  time.  Unsolved that is until
now!   In  the light of new evidence I
have  uncovered,  I can now reveal the
true  facts surrounding the mystery of
the Mary Celeste.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  brig  Mary  Celeste left New York
with  a  cargo  of  alcohol, bound for
Gibraltar.    Several  days  out  from
port,  she  was  hailed  by  a passing
tramp  steamer, and drew alongside the
ship.   A  party  was sent aboard, and
returned  with  two  items  of cargo -
one, an elderly Scotsman who went by
the  name  of  "Mad  Dougal",  and the
other a large square object, draped in
tarpaulin.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mad  Dougal,  it  seems had decided to
leave his native home of Scotland, (or
more  to the point, had been requested
to  leave  on  account  of  his unique
ability  to  unerringly  seek out, and
consume   large  quantities  of  uisge
beatha,    without   due   regard   to
requesting   permission   from   their
owners).   He  had  since learned that
his  precious  stock  of  the water of
life  had  dwindled  into nothing, and
began  to  regret his decision.  There
wasn't much he could do however, being
as how he was now well out of sight of
land,  so he consoled himself with the
company  of his pets he had decided to
bring with him.</P>
                                     
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, those of you who are reading this
story  will most probably be wondering
what those pets were - and many of you
will have already guessed exactly what
they  were.   Aye,  Mad  Dougal had in
fact  committed  a  cardinal  sin, and
brought  a  pair  of haggis out of the
country.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of  course,  no  other crew members of
the  tramp  knew  what  they were - in
fact  no other crew members really had
much  idea what Dougal was (apart from
the  fact  his  fare had been paid, of
course),  many  of them thought he was
in   fact   some   near   relative  of
Rasputin,  trying to escape to distant
shores.   All  however did know of how
fondness  for  the  uisge  beatha, and
were  rapidly  finding  out he had the
knack of locating anything with even a
trace  of  alcohol in it from one side
of  the ship to the other.  The result
of  this was the captain now found his
crew  on  the  verge  of  mutiny - all
alcohol  was  kept under lock, key and
armed  guard, and still Dougal managed
to get at it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon  sighting  the  Mary Celeste, and
persuading her to heave to, he managed
by  means  of  large  sums of money to
persuade  the  captain  to take Dougal
and   the   haggis   back  across  the
Atlantic with him, and soon, they were
all  safe  on  board.  Imagine Dougals
surprise,  nay the ecstasy, with which
he  greeted  the sight of the cargo of
the  Mary  Celeste - alcohol!  Now, it
has  been  said  that  if a man drinks
enough  whisky, he will live for ever,
but  no man has yet been able to drink
enough whisky.  Well, it wasn't whisky
,  but Dougal was more than willing to
give it a try, so off he went.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Haggis  by  now were beginning to
feel   a   little  neglected,  and  it
transpired  one  of then was pregnant.
You  don't require me to describe what
began  to  happen (I have already told
you  in  previous  articles  about the
nature and habits of pregnant haggis),
suffice  it  to  say that one morning,
the  crew  awoke to such a wailing and
moaning  they had never heard in their
lives, and several of them immediately
abandoned  ship.   Those who were left
managed  to stuff wax into their ears,
and  so  drown  out the terrible noise
the  Haggis were making, and of course
Dougal  was  well incapable of hearing
anything by this time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now,  there  are  more  things  in the
ocean  than  you  or I know about, and
the   noise  the  Haggis  were  making
finally  reached  the "ears" (for want
of  a  better  word)  of  one  of  the
denizens   of  the  deep,  (a  distant
relative  of Nessie, called Shamus, as
it happened), who immediately surfaced
to   investigate.   Upon  seeing  this
monster,  the  remainder  of  the crew
panicked, and as one, threw themselves
overboard,   leaving  Dougal  and  the
Haggis to their fate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  Dougal, having polished off a few
jars   of  the  cargo,  managed,  with
unerring  accuracy  to locate a bottle
of  25 year old uisge beatha belonging
to  the  now  departed  captain of the
Mary Celeste, and proceeded to consume
that  in no uncertain manner.  It is a
well  known  fact  that,  after  a few
drinks,  every  true Scotsman believes
himself   to  be  indestructible,  and
invincible.   Dougal  was no exception
to  this  rule, and upon staggering on
to  the  deck, and being confronted by
Shamus,  he  immediately  uttered that
completely    unintelligible    phrase
normally  uttered  by  Scottish drunks
just  before  they  stick the heid in,
"Whit're  you  lookin' at Jimmy?", and
gave  the  monster  a  "Glasgow kiss".
Shamus  was  not  particularly used to
this kind of greeting, but in order to
be    sociable,    he    decided    to
reciprocate,  and  returned the nod to
Dougal.</P>
                                     
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now,  if  you  can  imagine  the state
Dougal  was in after being heid butted
by  a  twenty  ton amphibious monster,
you will begin to appreciate the scale
of the situation.  Dougal was now "oot
the  box"  -  completely.   Of course,
Shamus wondered what he'd done wrong -
the  subject of his greeting was lying
prone  on  the deck of the ship, so in
an   attempt  to  revive  him,  Shamus
picked   up  Dougal,  shook  him,  and
tossed him in the air.  As a result of
this,  Dougal  landed  some five miles
from  the  Mary Celeste, and no longer
plays  any part in this tale.  Shamus,
still  hearing the droning and wailing
of  the  haggis,  and  recognising the
sound,  decided  he had perhaps rescue
them  from  their  fate in the hold of
the  ship,  and  steadying  himself by
grasping  the bow of the brig with one
claw,  deftly  picked  the  haggis  in
their  cage from the hold, and set off
for  the  shores of Scotland to return
them  to  their rightful homeland.  In
his  haste  to  return the haggis, the
Mary  Celeste was forgotten about, and
hence,  days later, she was sighted by
the Dei Gratia.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  know this story to be true, because
it  was  told  me  by  a gentleman one
evening in a pub after drinking a full
bottle  of  uisge  beatha, and it is a
well  know  fact  a  man who can drink
that  much,  and  still be understood,
cannot lie.</P>
