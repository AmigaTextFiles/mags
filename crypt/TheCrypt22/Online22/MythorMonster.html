<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although  Nessie  was sighted as far back as the 6th century A.D.  it
      is   the   modern   day  sightings  that  have  captured  the  public
      imagination.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early part of the 1930's a new road was built around Loch Ness
      which in turn brought in a spate of new sightings from road users and
      sightseers.   Up  until  this  time stories of the monster circulated
      more  within  the  local  community  but talk of other sightings were
      spreading outwith the village.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The first recorded sighting of Nessie on land was made by Mr.  Spicer
      and  his  wife,  on  July  22nd  1933, who were driving down the road
      between the Loch Ness side villages of Dores and Inverfarigaig.  They
      caught  sight  of  a large cumbersome animal crossing the road ahead,
      which  was some 20 yards from the water.  They first saw a long neck,
      forming  a number of arches, a little thicker than a elephant's trunk
      and  a  huge lumbering body heading towards the Loch.  It disappeared
      into the bushes out of sight.  After this sighting reports flooded in
      and  interest  grew  on  an international scale.  Speculators offered
      huge  prizes  for  the  animal,  dead or alive.  Circus owner Bertram
      Mills  promised  a  sum  of  £20,000  to  any man who could bring the
      creature alive to his circus.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Probably  one of the first photographs to be taken of the monster was
      snapped  by  a British Aluminium Company worker, Mr.  Hugh Gray, near
      Foyers.   It  showed  a  writhing  creature  creating  a considerable
      disturbance  on  the  surface  of  the Loch.  He only saw part of the
      animal which he estimated to be around 40 ft.  long, which included a
      thick rounded back and also a muscular looking tail.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  December  of  the  same year a hippo's foot had been planted by a
      prankster  and  all  was  taken  seriously  until  officials  finally
      uncovered  the  truth.   This  had  an  affect  on  future reports of
      sightings,  as  they  were  taken less seriously.  But still reported
      sightings were becoming increasingly common and more intriguing.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On  the 5th of January, 1934, a motorcyclist almost collided with the
      monster as he was returning home from Inverness.  It was around 1a.m.
      and  was  bright  due  to  the  moonlight.   As Mr.  Grant approached
      Abriachan on the north-eastern shore of the Loch he saw a large shape
      loom  on  the right side of the road.  As he approached the object he
      saw  a  small head attached to a long neck.  The animal saw Grant and
      promptly crossed the road back down to the Loch.  Mr.  Grant, by this
      time,  had  jumped off his motorbike and followed the path it took to
      the  Loch  only  to  see  the  rippling  water where the creature had
      entered.  In April, 1934 the most famous photograph was obtained by a
      London surgeon as he heading towards Inverness along the new road.</P>
      
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">This event encouraged more people to come forward with their tales of
      sightings.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  event on the 5th of June, 1934 was considered to be of importance
      but  was  not  widely  publicised.  It involved a young girl from the
      Fort  Augustus area who was employed as a maid in a large house close
      to  abbey.   It  was  about  6:30 a.m., the maid was looking out of a
      window  down  the  Loch.   She saw on the shore, ' one of the biggest
      animals  she  had  seen in her life, ' at a range of about 200 yards.
      Her  description  was  similar to those of others, giraffe like neck,
      small  head,  skin  like  an elephant and two very short fore legs or
      flippers.   She  watched it for around 20 mins when it re-entered the
      water and disappeared.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were a number of privately funded investigations, most of which
      were  not  successful,  which took place in the same year.  There was
      one  such  expedition which did have a degree of success.  It was led
      by  a  Sir  Edward  Mountain  in  July,  1934.  During that period of
      research  and  investigation  he  obtained five still pictures of the
      monster, he had observed the monster, along with members of his team,
      and  had  actually  filmed  the monster.  It was probably because the
      expedition  was so well funded that a result was most likely and that
      a poorly funded investigation would be doomed to failure.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  the  threat of war with Germany grew stronger, Nessie and all the
      sightings  were  furthest  things  from peoples minds, but there were
      some  recorded sightings and even a number of photographs were taken.
      During the war Loch Ness was in control of the Navy and the loch area
      was secured.  This did not stop the monster from making itself known.
      In  May, 1943, a Mr.  C.B.  Farrel of the Royal Observer Corps was on
      duty  to  warn  of  incoming  enemy  bombers but instead observed the
      movements  of  the  monster at a distance of 250 yards.  He saw 20-30
      ft.   of  the  monster's  body  and  the neck which was approximately
      4-5ft.  above the surface of the water.  The eyes, he explained, were
      large  and  the  body  of  the  monster appeared to have a 'fin'.  It
      finally submerged without a movement on the water.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the war was over and up until the late '50's sightings of Nessie
      continued  as  people  got back onto the road with their motorcars on
      the Loch side road.  The monster was still a local source of interest
      but remained the complete enigma.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  1951  a  new  photograph  appeared  which  to  some confirmed the
      existence  of  the  monster.  On the 14th of July at around 6:30 a.m.
      Mr.    Lachlan   Stewart,  a  woodcutter  employed  by  the  forestry
      commission,  saw  something  large  moving  out  on the Loch.  With a
      friend  he  ran to the waters edge and there about 50 yards away they
      saw  three  humps,  each about 5 ft.  long moving at fast speed.  Mr.
      Stewart  ,who  had picked up a small camera before leaving his house,
      took  this  photograph.   Seconds  later  a  small head and long neck
      appeared  in  front  of  the  first  hump then the monster turned out
      towards  the  centre of the Loch and with a lot of splashing swam off
      and sinking head first 300 yards offshore, disappeared.  Mr.  Stewart
      estimated the length of head and neck to be 6 ft., and then 15-20 ft.
      behind  the  last hump he noticed a commotion in the water suggesting
      the movement of the tail.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">      In  December  1954 another 'sighting' was made by a Peterhead fishing
      drifter called 'Rival III'.  The vessel captured an unusual graphical
      recording  of  a large object at a depth of around 480 ft.  - 100 ft.
      or  so  above  the  bottom - which kept pace with the boat for half a
      mile then disappeared.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Another  eyewitness  account  happened  in  October  1955, by Colonel
      Patrick  Grant  of  Knockie  Estate.   He  was  travelling  from Fort
      Augustus  to  Invermoriston  and  nearing  Inchnacardoch Bay he saw a
      great commotion in the water between 100-200 yards from the road.  He
      brought  his  car  to  a  stop and could see a black object above the
      surface  10  or  15  ft.   long.   In  less  than a minute the object
      suddenly started swimming eastwards, parallel with the shore and very
      near  the  surface  though  submerged.   Moving  at  great  speed  it
      travelled 200-300 yards and disappeared completely.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1955 brought one of the most intriguing photograph ever taken.  Peter
      A.   Macnab  from  Aryshire was having a holiday in the Highlands and
      was preparing to take a photograph of Urquhart Castle.  His attention
      was  drawn  to his left where he saw an enormous dark animal with two
      humps.  This is the photograph he took.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Spring  1958.   The proprietor of The Foyers Hotel, Mr.  Hugh Rowand,
      his wife and two friends were seated in their garden overlooking Loch
      Ness  when his eye caught a stationary fin shaped object in the water
      near  Sand  Point.   A few seconds elapsed and the object sprang into
      life  and  shot  across  the Loch towards Drumnadrochit.  Mr.  Rowand
      guessed it's speed to be in the region of 20-25 knots.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  Mr.   H.L.   Cockrell  of  Dumfries,  Scotland,  had  a remarkable
      experience  with  the monster in the Autumn of 1958 when he met it in
      his  canoe  on  the  Loch.   Mr.  Cockrell being an expert seaman and
      familiar  with  small  crafts  had developed a waterproof camera with
      flash  equipment  which  he  used from his camera was strapped to his
      head  like  a miner's lamp and activated by the movement of his mouth
      which  left  his  hands free to paddle.  He was boating about dawn on
      the Loch when something appeared about 50 yards away.  It looked like
      it  had  a  large  flat head 4 or 5 feet long and about 3 feet to the
      rear of this he noticed another thin line, all very low in the water.
      He  swung  round to approach what ever it was and to his great horror
      it  turned  towards  him.   He  took  a shot with his camera and kept
      moving  towards  it  and to his relief the creature turned to another
      direction.  When the film was developed , although it showed the Loch
      to  be  calm,  there  was  a great deal of disturbance on part of the
      surface of the water.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  day after Mr.  Cockrell's sighting the monster was seen by a Mr.
      Brown  and  his wife from Invergordon in the same place but closer to
      shore.   They  described it as three thick black humps moving through
      the  water with 50 ft.  ahead of the humps a movement which seemed to
      suggest a head.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  member  of  the  Northern  Naturalists  Organisations,  Mr.  Peter
      O'Connor from Gateshead, Durham had a sighting on the 24th May, 1960.
      From  the  garden of the Foyers Hotel he and a number of other people
      saw  the  creature at around 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  At first he
      thought  it  was  a rowing boat about 200 yards from the Foyers shore
      but  using  his  field  glasses  he could see a brown coloured object
      which was slowly sinking.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Mr.   O'Connor  encountered the monster yet again 3 days later on the
      27th of May, 1960.  Between 6 and 6:30 a.m.  he went for a walk along
      the  shore  beside Foyers Bay and the monster glided into view around
      the  headland.   He  waded  into  the  water up to his waist to get a
      closer  view.  It features were small and sheep-like and a very, very
      strong neck.  It's skin appeared smooth, very like a seal.  He turned
      to  yell  to  his  companion  and  then  turned  back  and  took this
      photograph,  to  the  right, as it disappeared into the turbulence it
      had created.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally  regarded  to  be  the  first  major scientifically planned
      expedition  of  its  kind to visit the Loch was conducted on the 27th
      June  to  23rd  July  1960 by The Universities (Oxford and Cambridge)
      Expedition.   The purpose being to make a general study of Loch Ness,
      paying  particular  attention  to  the possible existence of the Loch
      Ness  Monster.   Participant  in the expedition numbered 30 volunteer
      graduates  and  under  graduates who used cameras and an echo sounder
      mounted  on  a  boat.  They did encounter one visual sighting of what
      appeared  to  be the monsters back moving through the water.  Another
      sighting they had was of an object that continuously changed shape on
      the  surface  of the water.  Numerous echo soundings were taken which
      were of unusual character.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A sighting was reported on 7th August 1960 by a witness who wished to
      remain  anonymous.  The witness was driving south- westerly along the
      main  road  towards  Abriachan  pier  when  he  noticed a small yacht
      travelling  up  the  Loch.   He  then realised there were two V wakes
      parallel  to one another.  The closest of the two wakes came from the
      yacht  and  the  second appeared to be caused by something just under
      the  water.   The  object  surfaced  and  looked  just  like a midget
      submarine  without  its  periscope.   The  colour was greenish black,
      about the size of the yacht, which was in fact 48ft by 10 ft.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  1973  an  interesting  sighting was reported by a Mr.  Jenkyns of
      Pointclair,  Invermoriston.  Mr.  Jenkyns had a head/neck sighting in
      a  close range observation.  The sighting report is as follows :  Mr.
      Jenkyns lived in a house which is 12 yards above the surface level of
      Loch Ness.  On Saturday 10th November 1973, at about 11:45am he tried
      to  start a tractor which had been stuck for some weeks on a piece of
      rough  ground  sloping down to the loch edge to partially built jetty
      it was a cold slightly damp day, with a strong south-westerly wind on
      the  surface  giving  a  heavy  swell  with waves over 2ft high.  Mr.
      Jenkyns  used  an  engine  chemical  to  start the tractor and as the
      tractor did not have a silencer there was an explosive noise, so loud
      that  Mrs.   Jenkyns  heard  it in the house, despite all the windows
      being double glazed.  Immediately after the noise of the starter, Mr.
      Jenkyns  heard  a  very  loud splash, which he described as an impact
      splash as if something very heavy had been thrown into the water.  It
      was  a  single  noise  and was not followed by any further splashing.
      Being under the impression someone must of thrown a heavy object into
      the  water,  he got down from the tractor, walked round it and a good
      look  along  the  shoreline.   He then went back to the tractor and 2
      mins after hearing the splash noticed in the water 5 yards of the end
      of the jetty a ring of concentric circles, showing despite the waves.
      While  he was looking, a little to his left an animal emerged quietly
      and smoothly (the distance from the observer being about 45 yards) in
      a  north-easterly  direction  parallel  to  the shore, then submerged
      straight  down.   Throughout, the object maintained a rigid pole-like
      posture  and  its  motion  through the water was very smooth, with no
      apparent  sign  of  any  jerky  movement.   The  head  and  neck were
      slate-black, quite rigid and about 9 inches in diameter.  He observed
      a slit mouth, what appeared to be some large scales on the top of the
      head but not the neck, and above the mouth an eye or possibly a vent.
      The  eye  was quite tiny in proportion to the mouth.  When the object
      rose  out  of  the water, it formed an angle 80 degrees to the water,
      but  when  it started to move and throughout the movement it formed a
      60  degree  angle.   There  was  no  sign of any fins, horns or other
      appurtenances.   The water at this point is estimated to be only 10 -
      20ft deep.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Going  on  a number of years, this sighting occurred on the 13th July
      1979  by  Paul H.  Biermasz who was on holiday in the Loch Ness area.
      This  is Mr.  Biermaszs' own account of his sighting.  In July 1979 I
      had  a Nessie sighting that goes as follows :  I was driving from the
      camp site where I was staying at Invermoriston, north to Inverness on
      the  main  road when a few miles after Urquhart Bay, passing a lay-by
      with  a  good  Loch view, I saw 'It'.  'It' was at a distance of some
      200-300  metres,  shaped  like  an  upside- down (black) rowing boat,
      speeding  away  from  the shore.  The speed was remarkable because of
      the  wave 'it' produced.  Other people must have seen 'it', a sailing
      boat  crew might have spotted something as 'it' was coming their way.
      A  touring  bus  was in front of me and crossed the road to pull into
      the  lay-by.   Passengers in the rear of the bus were pointing at the
      Loch  also.   Everything  happened  in  seconds.   The  time  of this
      sighting was between 10 and 11 a.m..  The sky was cloudy but the Loch
      could be clearly seen and the wind was very low.  Back in Holland the
      story  of  my  sighting  was  not believed so I have kept quiet about
      until now.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  Lancashire  man, named Bill Kinder, observed a black, shiny object
      rise  out of the water and leave a 10 metre wake.  This took place on
      the  9th  of April, 1996 around 10:00am, just north of Fort Augustus.
      Also on the same day, the Ling family from London who were travelling
      behind  Bill Kinder on the west shore, reported seeing two humps rise
      out of the water and leave a long trail.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On  the 10th of April, 1996, two large brown shapes were spotted by a
      couple  from the Black Isle, which appeared to be 10 feet in diameter
      and  3  feet apart.  The object was 200m from the shore near Urquhart
      Castle, it then travelled across the Loch and disappeared.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A  representative of Union Commercials, named Jonathan Murphy, on his
      first  visit  to  Loch  Ness  to  make  a  television  commercial for
      Vodaphone,  contacted  a local paper and said he saw something in the
      water.   He  had  photographed the object which was then sent to NASA
      for  a  thorough  investigation.   This  happened on the 14th of May,
      1996.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Staff  and guests of the Craigdarroch House Hotel, Foyers, witnessed,
      on  the  13th  June,  1996  at 8:30pm, a bubbly disturbance which was
      followed  by  a  wake,  it  then  travelled  zigzag across the water,
      creating movement on the Loch for around 10 minutes.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> During  their  visit  to  the  Loch  Ness Caravan and Camping Park at
      Invermoriston, Emilio Demnio and Nikhi Banjeri from Preston, reported
      seeing  a  dark  brown or black hump appear in the middle of the Loch
      and  stayed  for  around  10  minutes,  on  the 21st of July, 1996 at
      2:15pm.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While  on  the  pier  at  Fort  Augustus,  three  witnesses including
      holidaymaker  Nick  Watson saw at around 5:30pm on the 1st of August,
      1996,  a  black  hump  approximately  a  mile from the shore.  It was
      creating  a  large  commotion on the surface.  A few minutes later it
      headed away from them and disappeared.</P>
      
      A  camper at Invermoriston photographed what looked like a head and a
      neck  emerging from the Loch.  Glaswegian Craig Kerr reported it to a
      national  newspaper.   The  object  appears  in  the  background of a
      photograph he was taking of another subject.  He did not realise this
      until the film had been processed.  This happened on the 18th August,
      1996.
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In 1996, staff members at the Clansman Hotel beside Loch Ness, during
      their  lunchbreak  around  noon witnessed several humps appear in the
      Loch.   They appeared to be black and were around 1 metre long.  They
      disappeared  and  shot  to  the surface again further out in the Loch
      within moments.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This   sighting  was  made  in  September  1996  by  Frank  Meyer  of
      Cincinnati,  Ohio.   These  are  his  own  words  :   As someone with
      scientific education (physics) I will not believe in anything I don't
      know  for  sure.  But I was on Loch Ness for four days in 1996 during
      the  first days of September with four relatives, we saw something we
      could  not quite explain:  We had rented a motor cruiser to travel on
      the Caledonian Canal for two weeks.  We spent one night at the Foyers
      pier.   The  weather  had  been fine in the evening, and the loch was
      very  quiet  in  the  morning,  practically  no  waves  at all, clear
      weather.   Around  8:45  AM,  I noticed something like the trunk of a
      large  tree,  floating  motionless  just under the surface, about 100
      meters  in  the direction of Urquhart Castle.  My four fellow boaters
      saw  it, too, after I asked them what it was.  It did not move for at
      least 15 minutes (well, one of us thought it had moved slightly).  We
      speculated  what  it  could  be, we watched it with binoculars (which
      revealed  that it was not a single blob of darkness, but had limblike
      substructures,  as  if  it really was a dead tree), but nobody took a
      single  photo!   I  still can't believe it...  Finally we took off to
      visit  Urquhart  Castle.  I took a course that would take us close to
      the point the mysterious object was floating.  Due to the position of
      the  steering  wheel,  I could not see it during the beginning of the
      approach  and relied on the others to take a close look.  But when we
      got  there,  nothing  was  visible.   Not  only  that, but nobody had
      actually  seen  it disappear.  One moment it had been there, a moment
      later it was gone without a trace.  It was obviously no tree.  Was it
      one of the almost stationary zones of rippled water that can occur on
      lakes due to wind and current?  It was so isolated - one dark spot in
      a  wide  totally  quiet  surrounding  -  and  stayed unchanged for 15
      minutes  or  more,  and  it was darker than the normal shadow - to me
      that  explanation  seems  practically  impossible.   The same reasons
      exclude  a cloud shadow.  For a mirage it was not far enough, and one
      thing  I  am absolutely sure of:  It was under the surface.  The only
      thing I can think of as possible explanation is a thin floating layer
      of  dark particles, slowly collected overnight by the currents of the
      Foyers  bay and of the open loch, clearly visible only because of the

      Gillies  from  Inverfarigaig  and  Peter  Rhind  from  the Black Isle
      watched  the  shape for about 45 minutes through binoculars before it
      disappeared under the water.  They described the shape as being about
      300  metres  from  the  shore, massive in size with a long tail.  The
      Loch was flat calm at the time.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We  had  just  arrived at Strone Holiday Chalet near Urquhart Castle,
      overlooking Urquhart Bay.  It was about 3:00pm.  We parked the car at
      the  rear  of  the  chalet  and were preparing to unload the car.  My
      husband  decided to stand and admire the view over Urquhart Bay, when
      he  noticed  a  black object in the water of about 14 foot in length.
      He  stood  for some 30 seconds trying to identify what the object was
      and  not  being  able  to he ran back to the car, opened the boot and
      reached  for  his  binoculars.   He  asked me to come and look at the
      object  with  him.  We both went to the side of the chalet and I also
      saw  the  same dark object in the water.  My husband stood looking at
      it through binoculars for about 30 to 45 seconds until it disappeared
      under  the  water.  I myself was looking at it with the naked eye and
      can  also  say  it was a large dark object, around 14 foot in length.
      It  looked to have a body and a head and it was animate, then it sunk
      into  the  water  without  any  obvious  diving motion.  My husband's
      description  of  the object is very similar to mine.  He saw a black,
      slick  object  of about 14 feet in length and stood 3 feet out of the
      water, there was no visible signs of flippers, fins, or a tail.  It's
      head  appeared  to  be  perfectly  round,  like  a football, but with
      obvious  sign  of a muzzle i.e.  like that of a seal.  The object was
      moving  slowly  through  the water with a slight bow wave, and it did
      not  arch  its  back to dive, it just gently slipped below the water.
      On  Saturday  the 19th the weather conditions were fine and clear and
      we  did  not notice any vessels in the Bay at the time, the water was
      very calm.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Both  my  husband  and  myself have in the past observed dolphins and
      seals  in the wild and this object did not look like either.  We have
      been  visiting the Loch Ness area for about 4 years and have seen the
      Loch's water in many different moods, also we have observed the wakes
      from  boats  and  have  seen wind slicks and dark shapes on the water
      which  are  often  mistaken for Nessie.  What we observed was none of
      the aforementioned, it was a solid object moving through the water.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Although  we  have ruled out what it was not, neither of us know what
      it  was.  All we can say is that we saw a large, black animal in Loch
      Ness.</P>
