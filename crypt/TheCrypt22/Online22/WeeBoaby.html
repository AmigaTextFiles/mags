                               <font color=yellow><CENTER> by "<I>Wee Boaby</I>"</CENTER>
<P>
 <font color=aqua>     Ella,  Boaby's beloved had gone to stay with her aged mother for a
      Week,   Leaving the Wee man to fend for himself.  Being a  typical
      Male  ...Boaby spent the best part of the Previous  night  in  his
      Local Tavern (<font color=white>The Piston Broke<font color=aqua>). Only to awaken the next Afternoon
      with the Customary Hangover!
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Oh!   Jeezus  Christ!"<font color=aqua> ...Said Boaby ...<font color=yellow>"I've  a  heid  like  the
      Elephant Man .. Oh!.. Christ I feel lousy."
<P>
<font color=aqua>     Boaby  climbed from his bed,  No need to dress as he had forgotten
      to take his clothes off the Previous night.
<P>
      After  a  Quick wash and shave,  Boaby started to  feel  a  little
      better and headed for the Kitchen.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Bluddy  Starvin"<font color=aqua> ...Said Boaby ... <font color=yellow> "Feed the  Bear"<font color=aqua>  ...   Boaby
      opened the Fridge.
<P>
      Boaby  played around with the Idea of Frying himself a  couple  of
      Eggs,   But  decided against it,  The thought of the Smoking  oil,
      causing gurgling eruptions in the Pit of his Stomach.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "AH!"<font color=aqua>  said  Boaby,  Now searching through the Freezer compartment
      ...<font color=yellow>"Jist  the Joab...  PIES"<font color=aqua> ..Boaby stood up holding  Two  frozen
      Scotch Pies.
<P>
      Whistling  happily to himself he opened the Door of  the  Cupboard
      containing the Crockery.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Suffering Christ!  ...Nae Plates"<font color=aqua>...Said Boaby. His eyes drifting
      to the Kitchen Sink ..Piled hight with HIS dirty Dishes.
<P>

  <font color=yellow>    "Ye'd  Think  Ella  wid make sure there wiz  enough  Bluddy  clean
      Dishes,"<font color=aqua> Said Boaby ...<font color=yellow> "Thats the Problem wie the Wimmen ...Alway
      thinking oh themselves ...Nae Bluddy Concideration fur ithers."
<P>
      "AH HA!"<font color=aqua> Cried Boaby ....Reaching up to the top Shelf...<font color=yellow>"Jist the
      Joab" ..<font color=aqua> said Boaby, Grabbing Ella's Pride and Joy.
<P>
      A  Bone  China Cake plate ...  Covered in hand painted red  Roses,
      with a Gold trim and a silver handle in the Middle.
<P>
      Boaby  placed his Two frozen Pies on the Plate and headed  towards
      the Microwave oven.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "CHRIST!  ye'd need a bluddy degree tae work these things"<font color=aqua>..  said
      Boaby."<font color=yellow>  Thats  the problem noo-a-days ...Yea get  all  these  new
      fangled things tae make Wimmens work easier,  but they dinnae tell
      yea how tae work them."
<P>
      "Bugger  It!" <font color=aqua>Said Boaby ...Placing the Pies and plate  into  the
      Microwave  ... <font color=yellow> "I'll try Full Power ....Mm..  Frozen Pies  ...Eh,
      Should take aboot 35 minutes ...Aye Easy enough."<font color=aqua> He smiled.
<P>
      Having  shut  the Microwave door and hit the Start Button,   Boaby
      left  the Kitchen,  Picked up his morning Paper from the Letterbox
      and Settled down in his Armchair.
<P>
      Boaby had barely got his Arse on the Chair,  and opened his  Daily
      Record at the Sport pages ...When there was a Loud Explosion
<P>

                               <CENTER><B>CAAAABOOOOOOOOM</B></CENTER>
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "SUFFERIN CHRIST!"<font color=aqua> Screamed the Wee man throwing himself  off  the
      Chair and onto the living room Floor
<P>
<font color=red>
<CENTER> <B>WHEEECH....  WHEECH ......SPLAT ....SPLAT</B></CENTER> 
<P>

   <font color=aqua>   Two Missiles narrowly missed Boaby's Head and Splattered onto  the
      Living Wall.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "GOOD  GOD!"<font color=aqua>  said an Amazed Boaby ..Staring at  the  Wall  ...Now
      covered with the Remains of his <font color=white> "Supersonic Scotch Pies"
<P>
 <font color=aqua>     Boaby climbed to his Feet and gingerly entered the Kitchen.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Bluddy Hell"<font color=aqua> ...Said Boaby ...The Microwave Oven's door had Blown
      off and lay at the oher side of the Kitchen, The Floor was covered
      in tiny shards of Bone Chine,  And in the Centre of the Oven was a
      small pool of Molten Metal.
<P>

  <font color=yellow>    "I  Bluddy  Telt ELLA No tae buy that "Made in Japan" Muck,   They
      buggers huv no forgotten the Bluddy War."
<P>
      "Look  at that"<font color=aqua> ..  Said Boaby .. <font color=yellow> "No even three month  auld  and
      Faulty already."
<P>
<font color=aqua>      Boaby  spent  the Next few Minutes Tidying up the Broken  Crockery
      from  the  Floor,   He tried sticking the  Door  back  on  to  the
      Microwave with Masking Tape, Satisfied with his Job, Boaby pressed
      the Start Button.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Nothing  ...  Bluddy Fuse musta blown"<font color=aqua> ...thought  Boaby ...<font color=yellow>"Noo
      whit will I eat?"
<P>
      "ACH..   Bugger it ...I'll just treat mysel tae a Chippie."<font color=aqua>Boaby
      grabbed  his  Bunnet and Jacket and made the  Short  walk  to  the
      Chipshop.
<P>
      When Boaby arrived at the Chipshop, It was empty ...Apart from the
      Man and Wife behind the Counter.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Gie's a Pie Supper.. Charlie"<font color=aqua> ...Said Boaby.
<P>

<font color=green>      "Onea  Pie Supper a Comin Upa ....And da name is Toni"<font color=aqua> ..Said  the
      Man.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "NO..  its bluddy NO ...  Yer Charlie Doak ...I wiz in School  wie
      ya.<font color=aqua> Said Boaby."
<P>

 <font color=green>     "I  wiz Charlie ...But changed my Name tae Toni when I bought  the
      Shop"<font color=aqua> ...He Replied.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "The  place huz always been called Toni's Chippie ...At least  for
      the Past 25 years."<font color=aqua> Said Boaby.
<P>

  <font color=green>    "AYE! Well it wiz Cheaper tae change my name by Deed Pole than get
      the Painters tae make a New Sign"<font color=aqua> ..Said Toni
<P>

<font color=green>      "Ye Wanta Salt ana Vinegar?" <font color=aqua>He asked
<P>

<font color=yellow>      "AYE"
<P>

 <font color=green>    "Thatsa One Pound Fifty ...Sur"
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "WHIT  ....Sufferin Christ ...Where dae ye get aff ...Overcharging
      People like That.  They pies are only forty Pence frae the Bakers,
      A  pound  ten  pence fur half a Bluddy Fried Tattie ...Yer  no  On
      PAL."
<P>

 <font color=green>     "Data is De Price ... Ye tak it or Leave it."
<P>

  <font color=yellow>    "Yer  a  Bluddy Con Man,  Alway huv been ...Chargin  Charlie  they
      called ye at School."
<P>

 <font color=green>     "LOOK!  ...Am no staunin here taking yer insults, Get the Hell oot
      oh my Shop ...GO oan bugger aff ...And Don't come back."
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Dinnae  Worrie yersel There Pal ...I widnae be seen deid  in  the
      Place." <font color=aqua>Said Boaby walking out of the Shop.
<P>

 <font color=green>     "Bluddy Cheek!"<font color=aqua> Said Toni ...<font color=green>"Talking tae Me like that in  my  Ain
      Shop.... I showed him who's Boss."
<P>

<font color=purple>      "AYE  ...MAYBE"<font color=aqua> ...Said his Wife ...<font color=purple>"But yea threw him oot  before
      he Paid fur his Chips."
<P>

 <font color=green>     "The  Theivin Wee Baz-turd"<font color=aqua> ...Said Toni ...Sinking his head  into
      his Hands ...<font color=green>"Even at bluddy School he could Fleece me."
<P>

<font color=aqua>      Boaby  was  happily wandering down the Road,  A large  portion  of
      Scotch pie in his mouth, and stuffing in the Odd Chip.
<P>
      With the sheer pleasure of the Pie Supper, Boaby was certainly not
      concentrating on where he was putting his Feet,  Not that it would
      have mattered as the View of his feet was completly obstructed  by
      the Newspaper from his Chippie.
<P>
      Hardly  surprising  then that Wee Boaby didn't  notice  the  Small
      Yellow and Blue tube lying on the Pavement ....Well until he Stood
      on it.
<P>
<font color=red>
                                 <CENTER><B>SQUEEEELCH!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua>      Wee Boaby stopped in his tracks! ...<font color=yellow>"WHIT THE HELL WAS THAT?"
<P>
  <font color=aqua>    Boaby slowly moved his Chippaper over to the left and looked Down.
      A  smile of relief came over his face,  when he saw only  a  small
      pool of clear coloured liquid seeping from under his left shoe.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Thank  Christ!" <font color=aqua>...Said Boaby ... <font color=yellow> "Thought it wiz Dog  Shite  or
      Puke I had stood on."
<P>

<font color=aqua>      Boaby  gently tried raising his foot to see what the  Liquid  was,
      But his Shoe stayed exactly where it was.  Boaby tried to lift his
      leg  a  bit  harder,  But no Luck his Brown Hush Puppy was  firmly
      stuck to the Pavement.
<P>

  <font color=yellow>    "OH!...  Bugger and Dam it".<font color=aqua>..  Screamed Boaby ..<font color=yellow>  "Whits happened
      Noo."
<P>
 <font color=aqua>     Boaby Slipped off his Left shoe,  and Hobbled over and placed  his
      Precious Pie Supper on the Wall at the Side of the Pavement.
<P>
      Boaby returned to his Shoe,  And with both hands grabbed the Upper
      and gave a quick Tug.
<P>
      The  Stubborn  Shoe didn't move,  Boaby Tried a bit harder,   Then
      tried with all his Might,  But the Shoe seemed firmly Stuck to the
      Paving slab.
<P>
      Suddenly...Boabys  attention was taken by a strange  Flapping  and
      Rustling  noise,  He looked over his Shoulder,  Only  to  see  two
      massive Seagulls getting Wolfed into his Pie Supper.
<P>

<font color=yellow>      "HEY!  ...BUGGER AFF YEA BLUDDY VULTURES"<font color=aqua> ... Cried Boaby, Running
      forward and Flapping his Arms in the Air.
<P>
      One seagull took off and soared into the Empty Sky with Boabys Pie
      in  its Beak,  The Second left with a Beak full of Chips,  But its
      large  Web  feet  hit the Newspaper and the Remainder  of  Boaby's
      Supper ...Disappeared over the Wall.
<P>
      It was a forlorn Wee Man that stuck his head over the Wall only to
      see his Meal floating down the River Clyde.
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "Thievin Wee Baz-turds"<font color=aqua>... Mumbled Boaby..Returning to the Problem
      with his Shoe.
<P>
      Boaby gently lift the Back of his Shoe ...<font color=yellow>"AH HA!  The Back bit is
      no stuck" <font color=aqua>..Said Boaby.
<P>
      Boaby  grabbed the Heel portion of his Shoe with both hands,   and
      placing a leg each side ...Heaved with all his might
<P>
<font color=red>
                               <CENTER> <B>EEEEEEEGHH ..</B></CENTER>
<P>

 <font color=yellow>     "No  Good"<font color=aqua>  thought  Boaby   ...<font color=yellow>"Its   still  Stuck  ...I'll  need
      something to Lever it up."
<P>
 <font color=aqua>     However  when  Boaby tried to stand up ...His  Hands  were  firmly
      stuck to the Sole of his Shoe.
<P>

<font color=yellow>      "ACH NO!"<font color=aqua>.. Cried Boaby ...<font color=yellow>"Ma Bluddy Hauns are stuck Noo."
<P>
<font color=aqua>      Boaby knelt down on the Pavement trying to see under his shoe,  to
      get  some  idea  what was causing all the Problems.   Unfortunatly
      Boaby  had  his  Knuckles on the Paving slab,  Only  to  find  his
      Fingers were not only stuck to his Shoe, But his knuckles were now
      firmly stuck to the Paving slab.
<P>

<font color=yellow>                       <CENTER><B>JEEZUS CHRIST ...HELP SOMEBODY!</B></CENTER>
<P>
 <font color=aqua>     Just at that two young teenagers appeared out of a dary allyway.
<P>

 <font color=white>     "Whits the Problem Mister"<font color=aqua> said Shuggie
<P>

<P>

      hopefully.
<P>

      Eventually finding his wallet.
<P>

<P>

 <font color=white>     ACH  Shut yer face<font color=aqua> ...said Shuggie ..giving Boaby a hefty kick  up
      the Arse.
<P>

      Boaby fell face first onto the Pavement,  Getting back up  on  his
      Knees  ...Only to hear a ripping sound ..as two of the Buttons  on
      his trouser fly remained Superglued to the Pavement.
<P>
      As  Boaby  struggled to his feet his trouser fell  slowly  to  his
      Ankles.
<P>

<font color=yellow>      I'LL GET YE FUR THIS ...YE PAIR OH BUGGERS<font color=aqua> ..Screamed Boaby at the
      Laughing teenagers ..Walking down the road counting Boabys Money.
<P>
      Boaby  was  struggling  and twisting his body  in  all  directions
      trying  desperatly to frre his hands,  He didn't even  notice  Big
      Mags  and  Soor faced Shelia coming out of the Back  door  of  the
      bakers shop.

<P>
      Ten  Minutes Later ...The Workmen had Coned off Boabys Arse,  The
      Brigade had Levered up the Slab.  The Medics gentley laid Boaby on
      the Stretcher ...Face upwards and with the Paving slab resting  on

<P>
 <font color=aqua>     The Heavy Paving slab bounced off Boabys head.<P>

      Having Quickly arrived at the Hospital,  The Doctor used a solvent
      liqued to Dissolve the Super Glue to Free Boaby.<P>

      The Nurse bandaged Boabys hands, and a rather nasty looking Cut on
      his Forehead.  She even pinned his Trousers ...With a rather large
      Safty Pin to protect his Modesty.<P>

      Boaby  Arrived  Home,   But the Problem  with  his  Trouser  ..Was
      bothering him.<P>

      Ella  wasn't due home until the Next Day,  And this was  the  Only
      Pair of clean Trousers he had.<P>

      The  Next  flat up from Boabys wee hoose ..belonged  to  Mary  and
      Calum Mackay.<P>

      Calum was a gentle Giant from the Islands,  A rather weird looking
      Man of six feet six with wild Red hair and a bushy beard.<P>

      His  Wife ...Mary was a cute looking Lassie of around 24 and  very
      shy.<P>

 <font color=yellow>     Nothing Fur it<font color=aqua> ...said Boaby ...<font color=yellow>I'll huv tae ask Mary if  she  kin
      mend ma Trousers.<P>

<font color=aqua>      Wee  Boaby  Knocked  on the Door,  and when Mary  answered  it  he
      explained his Predicament.<P>

<font color=purple>      Aye ok boaby ...i'll sew on a couple of Buttons for ye.<P>

<font color=aqua>      Boaby  stood  in the Centre of her small neat living room,   While
      Mary, Kneeled in front of him, Busy with her Needle and Thread.<P>

      Having sewed on the Missing Two Buttons .. Mary looked around her<P>

  <font color=purple>    Where did I pit the Scissors<font color=aqua> ...She asked<P>

<font color=purple>      Ach No Matter ...i'll just bite the Tread off <font color=white>(As most woman do)<P>

<font color=aqua>      Just at that point the Door opened and in walked Calum<P>

 <font color=yellow>     It's no whit it Looks <font color=aqua>...Pleaded Boaby<P>

 <font color=red>     IS IT NO?<font color=aqua> ...Said Calum ..picking Boaby up with one hand<P>

      Calum Banged Boabys head off the Ceiling, then holding the Wee Man
      out in front of him ...Smashed his fist intae his face<P>

<P>
 <font color=aqua>     Boabys nose Flattened ...and he did a backard Summersault over the
      Couch.
