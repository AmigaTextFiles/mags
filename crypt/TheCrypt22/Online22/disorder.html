        <font color=yellow><CENTER>They have finally found a diagnosis for my condition. Hooray!!</CENTER>
<P>
              <CENTER> I have recently been diagnosed with A.A.A.D.D. !</CENTER>
<P>
                 <CENTER>Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder...</CENTER>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This is how it goes:  I decide to wash the car; I start toward the
      garage and notice the mail on the table.  Ok,  I'm going  to  wash
      the  car.  But first I'm going to go through the mail.  I lay  the
      car keys down on the desk,  discard the junk mail and I notice the
      trash  can is full.  Ok,  I'll just put the bills on my  desk  and
      take  the  trash  can out,  but since I'm going  to  be  near  the
      mailbox anyway, I'll pay these few bills first.</P>

     

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Now,  where is my chequebook? Oops,  there's only one cheque left.
      My extra cheques are in my desk.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Oh,  there's the coke I was drinking.  I'm going to look for those
      cheques.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> But  first  I need to put my coke further away from the  computer,
      oh maybe I'll pop it into the fridge to keep it cold for a while.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I head towards the kitchen and my flowers catch my eye,  they need
      some water.  I set the coke on the counter and uh oh! There are my
      glasses.  I was looking for them all morning!  I'd better put them
      away first.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  fill  a container with water and head for the flower pots  -  -
      Aaaaaagh!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone left the TV remote in the kitchen.  We'll never  think  to
      look  in  the kitchen tonight when we want to watch television  so
      I'd better put it back in the family room where it belongs.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I splash some water into the pots and onto the floor,  I throw the
      remote  onto a soft cushion on the sofa and I head back  down  the
      hall trying to figure out what it was I was going to do?</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> End of Day:  The car isn't washed,  the bills are unpaid, the coke
      is  sitting on the kitchen counter,  the flowers are half watered,
      the chequebook still only has one check in it and I can't seem  to
      find  my car keys!  When I try to figure out how come nothing  got
      done today,  I'm baffled because I KNOW I WAS BUSY ALL DAY LONG!!!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  realize  this is a serious condition and I'll  get  help,   BUT
      FIRST I think I'll check my e-mail...</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please send this to everyone you know because I DON'T REMEMBER  TO
      WHOM I'VE SENT THIS !!!</P>
