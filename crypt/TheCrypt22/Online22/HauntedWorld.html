<font color=green><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ghosts    and   ghouls   and   strange
happenings  abound all over the world.
Every country has it's own weird tales
to tell - all are reported to be true,
told  by  people  not  given  to  wild
flights of fancy.  What do you think?</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In   1901   two  English  women,  Anne
Moberly  and Eleanor Jourdain, visited
the Palace of Versailles.  It was over
a  hundred  years after King Louis XVI
of  France  had  lived  there, but the
women became quite convinced that they
had   slipped  back  in  time.   While
looking for a pavilion in the gardens,





Anne  and  Eleanor  became lost.  They
saw  and  spoke  to several people who
appeared  to  be  wearing clothes that
were  in  fashion  when King Louis XVI
was alive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Anne and Eleanor walked through the
gardens,   they  were  overcome  by  a
strange  feeling  of sadness.  Eleanor
felt  as  though she was sleepwalking.
They  were frightened by a cloaked man
with   a   face  horribly  scarred  by
smallpox,  but were directed away from
him  by another gentleman.  Later they
discovered   that   their   guide  had
appeared  through a door that had been
blocked  up  for years.  Finally, Anne
saw    King    Louis'    wife,   Marie
Antoinette, sketching.
History  books  show  that the gardens
the  women walked through were just as
they  had been in the late 1700s.  Had
the two women really travelled through
time?   Or could they have experienced
a time-slip?</P>

         <font color=yellow><CENTER>Furry Friend Forever</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1954,  seven-year-old  Rene Leret,
from  Sampier,  near Lyon, was given a
little  white  kitten,  call  Jacques.
The  kitten  followed  him everywhere,
but, tragically, just one month later,
the  kitten  was  run over and killed.
Afterwards,    Rene    behaved    very
strangely.   He  said  he did not want
another  pet because Jacques was still
sitting  at  the  window.   Rene  then
started  putting  out food and opening
the  door  to  let the dead kitten in.
Even   more   freaky  were  the  newly
developed   photos  which  Rene's  mum
brought  home.   Posing  with Rene was
his  little  white kitten, weeks after
it  had  died.   Ghostbusters sensed a
strange presence in the house and even
found  claw marks on the newly painted
door, but they said they couldn't make
head nor tail of the case!</P>

        <font color=yellow> <CENTER>Things That Go Bump</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Calvados  Castle  in  Normandy was the
scene   of  such  serious  poltergeist
activity  in  1875-6  that it's owners
were  driven  from  their  home.  With
banging noises at night, the sounds of
someone   running   up  and  down  the
stairs,  ear-splitting  trumpet blasts
and  a  woman apparently screaming for
help  meant  that the residents got no
sleep at all.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  cries  of a woman sobbing and the
loud  notes of a locked-up organ being
played   added   to   the   resident's
problems.   Furniture  and other items
were  often thrown about the castle by
unseen forces!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  various  ceremonies  to exorcise
the  poltergeist  had  no  effect, the
owners  sold  the  10th century castle
and  moved  away.   The spirit causing
all  the  bother  was believed to be a
previous  owner,  an  angry woman, who
kept  coming back home to cause havoc.
Whoever it was, there is no doubt that
any house, or even a big castle, which
has   a   poltergeist  can  seem  very
crowded.</P>

         <font color=yellow><CENTER> Beastly Slaughter</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The   Gevaudan   district  in  Lozere,
south-east  France, was the scene of a
series  of  horrific  murders  between
1764  and 1767.  The victims tended to
be  women  and  children  whose bodies
were   ripped   apart   and  sometimes
devoured.   The  suspect  was  a huge,
wolf-like  creature.  As panic spread,
master  huntsmen  were  despatched  to
destroy  the  creature.   In  1765,  a
massive  black  wolf  was  slain,  but
relief  was short-lived as the ghastly
killings    continued.    The   horror
finally  ended  when another huge wolf
was  killed  at Mount Chauvet in 1767.
Was  it a real wolf - or could it have
been a werewolf?  The Chauvet wolf had
been shot with a silver bullet blessed
by a priest - said to be the only sure
way to kill a werewolf!</P>

        <font color=yellow> <CENTER>The Visionary Count</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back   in   the  18th  Century,  Count
Alessandro  Cagliostro  was fascinated
by  the  bizarre  and the strange.  He
used potions and crystals to help heal
the sick and believed that the letters
in anyone's name could be used to tell
their   future.    His  method  proved
frighteningly  accurate.  He correctly
predicted  that  King  Louis XVI would
have a violent death at the age of 38;
that his wife, Marie Antoinette, would
be   'prematurely   wrinkled   through
sorrow',  that she would be imprisoned
and  finally  lose  her  head  on  the
guillotine.   Banished from France for
being   framed  for  the  theft  of  a
necklace,   Cagliostro  continued  his
predictions  in  Rome, where a worried
French  diplomat  reported  him.   The
count was imprisoned and tortured, but
he  refused  to  retract  any  of  his
predictions,  all  of which turned out
to be true.</P>

       <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>The Man in the Iron Mask</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">King  Louis XIV imprisoned many of his
enemies.    One   man   was   held  in
conditions  of particular secrecy.  He
was  taken  into  custody  in 1669 and
remained  imprisoned  until he died 34
years  later, during which time he was
incarcerated    in    four   different
prisons.    To   prevent  his  jailers
recognising him, he was forced to wear
a   velvet  mask  fastened  with  iron
clips.  The French writer Voltaire was
imprisoned  in  the  Bastille in Paris
some  years after the mystery man died
there.  He called the mystery prisoner
"the  man  in  the  iron mask" and the
description   has   stuck.   Alexandre
Dumas  wrote a novel called The Man in
the Iron Mask, which fixed the idea in
people's minds, but now historians are
more interested in who the man was and
what crime he had committed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since  the late 19th century, evidence
has  grown  that  the masked man was a
valet, Eustache Dauger.  Historians of
pieced together some interesting facts
about the life of Dauger.  He was born
in  1637 into a wealthy family and was
a  childhood  friend of Louis XIV.  He
led   a   wild   life   and  ended  up
penniless.   At Louis' request, Dauger
went  on  secret  missions to see King
Charles   II   in   England,  and  was
arrested  in  Dunkirk  in  1669 on his
return.    He  died  in  1703  in  the
Bastille and was buried under the name
of Marchioly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  did  he  know?   The  details of
Dauger's life and death match those of
the  masked  man.   He probably knew a
secret  which would damage the king if
he  revealed  it.   There were several
things  he  could  have  known, gained
during   his   missions   to  England.
Charles II was a catholic in a largely
protestant  country,  and wanted money
from   Louis   XIV   who  was  also  a
catholic,  to  promote the religion in
England.    It   may  be  that  Dauger
learned too much about these sensitive
matters.   Illegitimacy probably had a
large  part  to  play  too.  There are
theories    that    Dauger   was   the
illegitimate   son   of   Louis  XIV's
father,  and  Marie,  Dauger's mother,
although  this seems unlikely as Marie
would  probably  not have betrayed her
husband,  or  that  Louis  XIV was the
illegitimate  some of Dauger's father,
Francois  and Louis XIII's wife, Anne.
This  could  be  more likely, as Louis
XIII  and Anne were childless for many
years.  It may have been that the king
felt  unable  to  father  a  child, so
turned  to someone else to provide him
with  an  heir.   It  is possible that
Louis  XIV  knew  this  and  threw his
half-brother into jail so he could not
contest  the claim to the throne.  The
identity  of  the man in the iron mask
remains   uncertain.   Historians  are
continuing to investigate.</P>

     <font color=yellow><CENTER>Talking About the Revolution</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During  the  French  Revolution at the
end  of  the 18th century, Madam Marie
Tussaud  was  imprisoned and forced to
make  wax masks of the faces of people
who   had   been   beheaded   on   the
guillotine.   In  1802,  her  waxworks
exhibition came to London.</P>

             <font color=yellow><CENTER>Nostradamus</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  people have heard of Nostradamus
and  his  predictions.  He was born in
Provence,  as Michel de Nostradame, on
14th  December  1503.   He  spoke many
languages   and   studied  philosophy,
astronomy and medicine.  He earned his
name  as Europe's plague healer when a
plague  swept  through France, but was
ruined  when  the  plague struck again
and he failed to save the lives of his
wife  and children.  He spent the next
six years wandering through France and
Italy,  before  returning  to a secret
place in Provence to write his book of
prophecies,  known as "The Centuries".
He was a master at making things sound
vague, and to make things trickier, he
wrote  in  French,  Greek  and  Latin.
Over  the  years many of the quatrains
have appeared to come true:-</P>

<CENTER>The Great Fire of London in 1666</CENTER>
<CENTER>The rise of Adolf Hitler in 1939</CENTER>
<CENTER>The  bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
in 1945</CENTER>
<CENTER>The  assassination of J.F.  Kennedy in
1963</CENTER>
<CENTER>Halley's Comet in 1986</CENTER>
<CENTER>He  even  predicted  his  own death in
1566!</CENTER>
<P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nostradamus   even   described  things
which weren't invented until centuries
later - fighter planes, submarines and
nuclear arms, for example.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over    the    years,    people   have
interpreted  his  riddles  in entirely
different  ways  to  suit  the  events
which have happened or are happening .
Then,  with  the benefit of hindsight,
Nostradamus     is    proclaimed    as
predicting  the  future  - again.  His
riddles  make interesting reading, but
understanding  or applying them can be
extremely difficult!</P>
  
  <font color=yellow><CENTER>Weird Happenings on the High Wire</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1973, an eccentric Frenchman called
Henri   Rochatain   spent  six  months
living  on a high wire 25 metres above
the  town of Saint Etienne.  Whilst he
was   up   there,   Henri  walked  500
kilometres  up  and  down  the wire to
keep  fit.  Most extraordinary of all,
however,  was  how he managed to sleep
on  a  board that was not fixed in any
way,  but simply balanced on the wire.
Rolling  over  in his sleep would have
been   enough  to  send  the  highwire
supremo  plunging to his death, but he
slept    peacefully,    even    though
thunderstorms and high winds!</P>

         <font color=yellow><CENTER>Death Down the Wire</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1984,  an  electric  storm brought
death  'down  the wire' to two unlucky
people  in  Toulouse.  When lightening
hit  a  telephone wire, a fireman, who
was  on the phone to a colleague about
storm  damage, literally got it in the
ear  and  died.   Another girl who was
calling   her  boyfriend  was  fatally
knocked  out.   Though  it  is  a rare
occurrence,    telephone   wires   can
occasionally  conduct all the power of
an electric storm and deliver a deadly
shock  to whoever is at the end of the
line.</P>

              <font color=yellow><CENTER>A-Maze-ing</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Researchers  claim  to  have  recorded
strange energies in ancient monuments,
such  as the 13th century cathedral at
Chartres.   The  labyrinth maze design
on  the  cathedral floor is known as a
penance  path, and people used to walk
it    barefoot    as   a   punishment.
Supposedly,  this  was a direct way to
absorb  the  Earth's natural energies.
Incidentally,  Chartres  was  a sacred
site  for  the  Druids  and  later the
Romans.</P>

<font color=green><P ALIGN="LEFT">Talking   of   shocking   things   and
unwelcome visitors:</P>

            <font color=yellow><CENTER>Holiday Howler</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Claire's  parents  had  bought  an old
cottage  in the French countryside and
she  and  some college friends decided
to  visit  it.  Claire had a rough map
of  how to find the cottage and a key.
But  her  parents  warned her the lock
was very stiff.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a long drive from Paris, and it
was pitch dark by the time they needed
to  use  the sketchy map.  They turned
on  to  a  rough,  winding  track  and
bumped  along  with only the headlamps
to guide them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suddenly  they  spotted a cottage, set
back  from  the  road,  just as it was
shown  on  the  map.  With relief they
piled   out   of   the   car.   Claire
struggled to turn the key in the front
door,  but  couldn't  get  it to turn.
Her  friends  all  tried,  but  no-one
could open the door.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  were  just being to despair when
there was a shout from the back of the
cottage  from  one  of the others.  He
had managed to prise open a window and
announced they could easily climb in.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inside,   they   discovered  that  the
cottage  was  far  more luxurious than
any  of them had been expecting.  From
the  kitchen they found the makings of
a  midnight feast.  Then they all took
hot baths and fell into bed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Early  next  morning,  Claire  was the
first  to  wake.  Downstairs the place
was  a  mess, but she decided to leave
it until later and go exploring.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just  down  the  road,  she discovered
another  cottage.  Building rubble was
piled  outside  and  when  she  peered
through the dusty windows she saw that
the   rooms  were  bare.   A  horrible
thought  dawned  on  her.  She felt in
her  pocket and found the key from the
night  before.   She  tried  it in the
lock  and  found  that it turned quite
easily.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inside,  she  found  a  note  from her
parents, warning her about the wealthy
and  very  unpleasant  neighbours.  As
she read it, she heard a car coming up
next door's drive..........</P>

<font color=green><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you've gotta do what you've gotta
do........</P>

            <font color=yellow><CENTER> Dead Fluffy</CENTER>
<P>
<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John  was  staying near Paris with his
friend,  Pierre.   He got on well with
the   whole   family,  and  even  made
friends     with     their     elderly
Rottweiller, Bonbon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  next  door neighbours didn't like
dogs, but were very fond of Frou-Frou,
their daughter's large white rabbit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  morning, the boys were left alone
in  the house.  Pierre's parents asked
them to keep an eye on Bonbon, but the
boys  got  so wrapped up in a computer
game  that  they  didn't see Bonbon go
into the garden.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  came  in  half  an  hour later and
dropped a very dead Frou-Frou at their
feet.   The horrified boys peeped next
door.  The rabbit hutch was empty.  So
was   the   garage   -  at  least  the
neighbours were out!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They   got   to  work  shampooing  the
rabbit,   then  blow-drying  its  long
hair.   Afterwards  it  looked  a  lot
fresher  than  when Bonbon had brought
it  in,  more  like  a sleeping rabbit
than a dead one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They sneaked into the next door garden
and  placed  Frou-Frou  in  the hutch.
Happy  with  their  cover-up job, they
waited  for Pierre's parents to return
home.   They  arrived  looking very up
set and puzzled.  Their neighbours had
just  told  them that some sick person
had  dug  up  their  pet rabbit, who'd
died   and   been   buried   two  days
before.....   and,  as  if that hadn't
been bad enough, the sicko had thought
it funny to give poor Frou-Frou a wash
and  brush-up  and put it back in it's
hutch!</P>

<font color=green><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  hope  you enjoyed that little lot -
but  that's  all for now.  Next issue,
we'll  be  taking  a  look  at strange
happenings  and  other  weird stuff in
South America.  Bye, sweet dreams.</P>
