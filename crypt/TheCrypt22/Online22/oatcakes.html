     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Oatcakes  (or  breed  as  it is traditionally called in the Northeast
      shoulder of Scotland.  Incidentally, bread is called loaf) are cooked
      on  a  griddle  and  look  like biscuits about 1/4 inch thick and can
      either be triangular or circular in shape.</P>

             <CENTER>Oatcakes are served with haggis, stovies, cheese, etc.</CENTER>

                                  <CENTER><B> Ingredients</B></CENTER>
<P>
     <CENTER> 4 oz. medium oatmeal</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 1 tablespoon melted beef dripping, bacon fat or vegetable oil</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Pinch of salt</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 2-3 tablespoons boiling water</CENTER>
<P>




                                  <CENTER> <B>Directions</B></CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sprinkle  a  baking  board  with  medium  oatmeal.   Mix together the
      ingredients  and  form  into  a ball.  Place this onto a baking board
      that has been sprinkled with a little medium oatmeal and roll out the
      mix  to  form a round about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into four triangles.
      Work  quickly  since the mixture becomes difficult to work with if it
      becomes cold (it will break and crack).</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Put  the  oatcakes  on a hot griddle and bake on one side only.  Once
      the  edges  curl  they are cooked and now must be placed on a rack or
      tea-towel  and allowed to dry off in a warm room (or in the oven on a
      rack).</P>
 
                                   <CENTER><B>Variations</B></CENTER>
<P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In the recent past oatcake manufacturers have added extra ingredients
      to  their  oatcakes  to  extend  the range available in shops.  These
      include  mixed  herbs,  ground black pepper or even cheese.  Once you
      have  tried  plain  oatcakes  why  not  try  experimenting  with  the
      ingredients.</P></font></font>
