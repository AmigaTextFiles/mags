 <font color=aqua>     Have you ever wondered where and how yodelling began?
 <P>     
      Many  years  ago  a  man  was  travelling  through  the  mountains of
      Switzerland.  Nightfall was rapidly approaching and he had nowhere to
      sleep.   He  went  up to a farmhouse and asked the farmer if he could
      spend  the  night.   The  farmer  told him that he could sleep in the
      barn.
 <P>     
      As  the story goes, the farmer's daughter came down from upstairs and
      asked her father, "Who is that man going into the barn?"
 <P>     
      "That's  some fellow travelling through," said the farmer.  "He needs
      a place to stay for the night, so I said he could sleep in the barn."
<P>      
      The  daughter  said,  "Perhaps  he  is hungry." So she prepared him a
      plate of food and took it out to the barn.
<P>      
      About an hour later, the daughter returned.  Her clothing dishevelled
      and straw in her hair.  Straight up to bed she went.
<P>

     
      The  farmer's  wife  was  very  observant.   She  then suggested that
      perhaps  the  man was thirsty.  So she fetched a bottle of wine, took
      it  out  to  the  barn,  and she too did not return for an hour.  Her
      clothing  was askew, her blouse buttoned incorrectly and her hair all
      messed up.  She also headed straight to bed.
  <P>    
      The  next morning at sunrise the man in the barn got up and continued
      on  his  journey, waving to the farmer as he left.  When the daughter
      awoke  and  learned  that the visitor was gone, she broke into tears.
      "How  could  he  leave  without even saying goodbye," she cried.  "We
      made such passionate love last night!"
<P>      
      "What?" shouted the father as he angrily ran out of the house looking
      for  the  man,  who  by  now was halfway up the mountain.  The farmer
      screamed  up  at  him,  "I'm  going  to get you!  You had sex with my
      daughter!"
<P>      
      The  man looked back down from the mountainside, cupped his hand next
      to his mouth, and yelled out,<font color=white> "LAIDTHEOLADEETOO."
