<font color=yellow><CENTER>A review by Ian Urie</CENTER>
<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Virii  are  definitely a threat to anyone on the Internet, regardless
      of what O/S is used.  The P.C.  market with Windows being the largest
      O/S  in  use  has  a  real problem regarding the chances of getting a
      virus.   This  isn't  just because of the various security holes that
      are  constantly  being  found  and plugged, but also because with the
      largest user base ....  more virus writers tend to migrate to it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  there  are options available.  You can pay for a large Company's
      product,  like  MacAfee,  Norton etc.  or scout around for the latest
      free virus checkers available.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of  the  virus  checkers  on  the  go at present that has a free
      download  (as  long  as you are using it on a single computer) is the
      AVG package.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The   package  can  be  found  at  the  companies  website  which  is</P>
<font color=silver><CENTER> http://www.grisoft.com</CENTER>
<P>
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">See AVG Screengrab 1</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  installed  the package to give it a try as some of my friends have
      found it to be very welcome on their drives.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  package  installs easily after downloading and the questions are
      kept to a minimum.  No surprises with the install and everything went
      smoothly  on mine.  After a reboot, as per usual, you notice that AVG
      does  a  check on bootup.  Fear not, if you don't want it to, you can
      customise the program to suit yourself.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm afraid the screengrabs aren't all that good this time around, but
      I'm sure you can get the gist from them.</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> (Duel  Editor Ray Hawkins to the rescue.)<font color=red> For some strange reason the
      text  on the screengrabs became very distorted, However as I also use
      this  excellent  program  I  tried  to  duplicate them myself.  Oddly
      enough the screengrabs using WindowsXP turned out fine! </P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">See AVG Screengrab 2</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  program  has a few options that can be found in the main control
      centre  page.   These  are  the resident shield, where you can decide
      what  exactly  the  program  checks  for  and  whether  it will do it
      automatically or ask you first.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> See AVG Sreengrab 3</P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The next option is the email part, where again, you decide whether to
      check  all  your incoming and out going mail (a boon just in case you
      were  already  infected  and hadn't checked the system first) and the
      certify  option.   This appends a signature stating that the mail has
      been  checked  by  AVG before being sent.  This also is an indication
      that nothing has interfered with the operation of AVG.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  This  program also has a plugin for Outlook Express .....just in case
      you use that program for your mail.</P>

    <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">  See AVG Screengrab 4</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  update  manager  does exactly what it says and allows you to use
      the  scheduled  updates function, and where to get the updates.  With
      this  you can specify how often to try for an update and if it fails,
      how  long between retries.  Again, you can decide whether the program
      accesses the internet automatically or asks permission first.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> See AVG Screengrab 5</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  scheduler  isn't  for  updates, but when to perform tests on the
      computer it is installed on.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The next option "information" is the first grab shown at the start of
      the article.</P>

    <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">  See AVG Screengrab 6</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe I should have shown the main page first ....  This is where you
      can  instantly  check your computer and enable/disable the functions.
      Being  a  virus checker, it is also possible to check removable media
      and  the  memory.  If you decide to run the complete test, you'll get
      something like this popping up.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">See AVG Screengrab 7 </P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Execution of the tests is fast and complete.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  program also logs all tests and results, so you can see not only
      what  you have checked but when.  Of course, it wouldn't be much good
      to  you if it didn't have any help files, just in case you had doubts
      about all the options and this is shown in the page below.</P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT">See AVG Screengrab 8</P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  AVG  system  also allows you to make a rescue disk.  Next is the
      grab for that particular bit.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> See AVG Screengrab 9 </P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Again, straight forward and only requires you to insert a disk.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  the  main  page which was shown above, it has a database of known
      virus  files  with  some  information  on them.  You can read to your
      hearts  content about the exploits of these and it does tell you that
      these  are  only a small selection of the virii that it will contain.
      You  can  even  have a small piece of information about your computer
      displayed  showing  exactly  what  it is running and what AVG decides
      that you have.</P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> See AVG Screengrab 10</P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As  you  have  seen  above,  it  isn't  just a straight forward check
      program  but  can  be  altered  to do what you particularly want your
      virus  checker  to  do.  I keep a couple of virii locked inside a zip
      file  for  testing,  and  AVG passed with full colours by discovering
      them....something  which I found not to be the case with another free
      checker!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  the  cost  of  a download and with free updates, this is a cheap
      option  for  a  virus  checker.  The program worked efficiently on my
      system and I had no problems either installing or taking it back off.
      All  the  options  are fairly self explanatory and easy to find.  The
      help  system  is  pretty  cursory  but  doesn't really need to be any
      larger.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> All in all, something to keep if you need a checker and don't wish to
      shell out money for it.  At the very least it will expand the options
      available to you.  The program states that it works with all versions
      of Windows.</P> 

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not exactly a must have (since most systems come with a virus checker
      nowadays),  but  definitely one to keep in mind if you fancy a change
      or you need another checker for whatever reason.</P>

      <font color=red><P ALIGN="LEFT">Final note from Ray Hawkins</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> WindowsXP  does  not  come  bundled  with a virus checker!  Microsoft
      place  all  their  faith  in  their new firewall!  WindowsXP can also
      become  unstable  with  some virus checker  programs.   AVG  has been
      installed  on  my  PC for just over 3 weeks and has performed fine...
      A recommended 5 star download.</P>
