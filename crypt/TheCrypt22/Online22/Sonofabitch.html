<P>    
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  priest  took  a sabbatical to a fishing lodge.  On the last day of
      his  trip  he hooked a monster fish and proceeded to reel it in.  The
      guide,  holding  a  net,  yelled  "Look  at the size of that Son of a
      Bitch!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Son, I'm a priest.  Your language is uncalled for!"</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "No, Father, that's what kind of fish it is.  A Son of a Bitch fish!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Really?  Well, help me land this Son of a Bitch!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Once  in  the  boat, they marvelled at the monster.  "Father, that is
      the biggest Son of a Bitch I've ever seen."</P>
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yes, it is a big Son of a Bitch.  What should I do with it?"</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Why  eat it of course.  You've never tasted anything as good as that
      Son of a Bitch!"</P>
      

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Elated,  the  priest  headed home to the church.  While unloading his
      gear and his prize catch, Sister Mary inquired about his trip.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Take a look at this big Son of a Bitch I caught!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, "Father!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"It's  ok  Sister.  That's what kind of fish it is.  A Son of a Bitch
      fish!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Oh,  well  then,  what  are  you  going to do with that big Son of a
      Bitch?"</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Why, eat it of course.  The guide said nothing compares to the taste
      of a Son of a Bitch."</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  Sister  informed the priest that the Pope was scheduled to visit
      in a few days and that they should fix the Son of a Bitch for dinner.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I'll even clean the Son of a Bitch," she said.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> As she was cleaning the huge fish, the Friar walked in.</P>

     
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"What are you doing Sister?"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Father  wants  me  to  clean  this big Son of a Bitch for the Pope's
      dinner."</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Sister!   I'll  clean  it if you're so upset!  But please watch your
      language!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"No, no, no.  It's called a Son of a Bitch fish."</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Really?   Oh  well,  in that case, I'll fix up a great meal and that
      Son  of  a  Bitch  can  be  the main course!  Let me know when you've
      finished cleaning that Son of a Bitch."</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">On  the night of the Pope's visit, everything was perfect.  The Friar
      had  prepared  an  excellent  meal.  There was wine, and the fish was
      excellent.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Pope said, "This is great fish, where did you get it?"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"I  caught  the  Son  of  a Bitch!" proclaimed the proud priest.  The
      Pope's eyes opened wide, but he said nothing.</P>
      



     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "And  I  cleaned the Son of a Bitch!" exclaimed the sister.  The Pope
      sat silent in disbelief.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> And  the  friar  added,  "And  I prepared the Son of a Bitch, using a
      special recipe!"</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  Pope  carefully looked at each of them.  Then slowly a big smile
      crept across his face then he said...  "You fuckers are alright!!"</P>
