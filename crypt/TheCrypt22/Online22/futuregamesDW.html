<P>
     
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">One  day a little two player game found its way to our hard disk.  It
      was named BattleXII WB and was after a short time of confusion really
      funny to play.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">But  as  time  passed  many bugs and gameplay mistakes arised that we
      wouldn't  live  with.   Instead of sending a bug report to the author
      like others do we started to code our own version...</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> ...three  weeks  of  hard  work  later  our own version was finished,
      called</P>
     
      <font color=lime><CENTER><H1>YATAG The Final Abklatsch</H1></CENTER><P>
      
     <font color=white> <CENTER>The Gameplay:</CENTER><P>
     
     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Both  players  own  a  base at their screen half.  It consists of ten
      spaceship hangars, the generator and a fixed defence lasercannon.</P>

      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At  the beginning each player has 5 fighters (2 special and 3 normal)
      and  5 bomber (same splitting).  The fighters are a bit faster, armed
      with  a  lasercannon.   They are planned for short range fights.  The
      bombers  are  able  to  drop their bombs at higher range, but have to
      return after every shot to get new ammunition.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  destiny  of the game is to eliminate all enemy ships.  It may be
      helpful to destroy the others base and its repair facilities.</P>
      
      <font color=white><CENTER>Technique:</CENTER><P>
     
     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Good  programmers  are  lazy.   Concerning  this  point  we are great
      programmers.   :-)  The  game  was  originally  never  planned to get
      published,  so we renounced of all optimizations and details.  That's
      the cause for the giant hardware demands:</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">CPU 030/50, the more the better Graphics board necessary!!!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may sound very much for such a little game, but at the beginning
      it was aimed to work only with our system.</P>

                        <font color=red><H1> <CENTER>DREAMWORLD - BETWEEN THE LINES</CENTER></H1>
      
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between the Lines (short:  BTL; Don't confuse this with Shadowrun) is
      a  3D  realtime action RPG.  The idea behind is quite old, but it had
      to  wait  until  the technology was able to handle our demands :) Its
      simply  the  dream  of  a  RPG that doesn't need any text to tell you
      what's  happening,  only  having  the  rules everybody already knows.
      Just real life, taken to an strange new world.</P>
     
      <font color=white><CENTER>The Story:</CENTER><P>
    
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Story  is not sure yet.  We've so much ideas, it's impossible to
      get  them all in one plot.  The only thing sure is that there will be
      no brave chosen warrior, no big bad guy and no happy end.  All people
      you  encounter  in the game will have their own aims, their behaviour
      will  depend  on yours.  Maybe the help you if you're friendly, maybe
      they hate you because you killed friends of them.  Even your own aims
      aren't determined, it all depends on your decisions.  Of course, it's
      impossible to kill all your enemies yourself.  Most of your opponents
      are  as  good as you in fighting matters or even better.  So you have
      to  use  tricks  to  kill them or you ask someone more mighty to help
      you.   Or  you  simply  avoid  the fight by trying a different way to
      achieve your aim.  It's all up to you.</P>
      
      <font color=white><CENTER>The Controls:</CENTER><P>
     
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  game  will offer you as much freedom as possible, in an easy and
      intuitive  way  to act.  go, Run, crawl, jump, climb, attack, defend,
      look...   everything  is possible by the mouse and a few keys.  Using
      the  mouse  and its keys you control your own hands which do the rest
      then.   For  example,  opening  a door is done by simply grabbing the
      doorhandle  and  dragging  it.  Closing it is similar.  To activate a
      lever  switch  you  just need to grab it and drag it down.  To fill a
      flask  just  take  it  in  your  hand  and  hold it in the water.  It
      couldn't  be  simpler.   Physics are also very important.  Sharpness,
      weight  or  range  of  your weapon will be simulated by the speed the
      weapon  reacts  upon  your input or similar symptoms.  You'll feel it
      more  than see it.  The monsters will also be live calculated instead
      of  using fixed anim phases.  So the beasts will move freely to react
      on  all situations they encounter, not determined on fixed reactions.
      Be also prepared to encounter many animals that are only there to eat
      and  to  be  eaten, a possibility for you to get some food to sell or
      eat.   Speaking  to  people  is  also  an important part of the game.
      Maybe  multiple  choice, maybe something completely different, but no
      separate  screen.   In  fact, you'll never see yourself from outside,
      all talks and actions are seen with your own eyes.</P>
      
      <font color=white><CENTER>Multiplayer option:</CENTER><P>
     
     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I'm  dreaming  of  giving  this  game  multiplayer  capabilities  via
      internet.   Live  your  life  in  the  net,  be a pirate, a trader, a
      mercenary,  a thief.  Be member of a guild or a secret society.  Talk
      to  other  players,  deal  with them, solve quests together or simply
      fight them for the expensive armour they wear.</P>
     
     <font color=white><CENTER> The Hardware:</CENTER><P>
     
    <font color=aqua> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> An  AmigaNG.   That's  the computer this game is aimed at.  But until
      then  PPC,  fast  3D Hardware and 32 MB RAM.  Later surely more.  The
      engine uses Warp3D and RtgMaster.</P>
      
      <font color=white><CENTER>Disclaimer:</CENTER><P>
      
      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  of  the things written above are only a wish list, I don't know
      how much of it I'm capable to realize.  But it will surely take years
      until  it is finished.  The only thing of the game that exists so far
      is  a  provisional  3D  engine.   The  editor  is  developed further,
      offering  all  the  things  that  are  needed  to  build, texture and
      enlighten a world.  Nothing more so far.</P>
