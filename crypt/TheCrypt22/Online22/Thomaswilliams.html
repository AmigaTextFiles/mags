<P>

     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well who am I?...  Flip that's a good question.  Well I live in  a
      cess  pool  called Bromsgrove.  It's approximately 10  miles  from
      Birmingham,  sort of in the middle bit of Great Britain.  Probably
      why  it's called the midlands.  It's probably the worst  place  on
      Earth  you  could live.  Mind you if you're into banks,   building
      societies and charity shops,  this place could be heaven. The only
      redeeming feature of the place is that it's right next to the  M5,
      so  you  have access to other places which are not so  boring  and
      mind bogglingly incermountingly downright depressing.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  for now forget Bromsgrove (if you can heh heh),  and get  back
      to  me.   This is after all why you're reading this in  the  first
      place,  and secondary,  why are you reading this? Well I was  born
      in a place called Hillingdon,  Middlesex or so I'm told. In fact I
      was  born 16th January 1969,  so that makes me really really  old.
      As far as I know I haven't died yet so I must be still alive.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  also  spend  a  lot  of time using the ultimate  computer  'The
      Amiga'.   My  interests include playing the  guitar,   programming
      computers (oh yes and I mean real computers,  not PC's),   writing
      poetry,   generally  writing   anything,   science  fiction,   and
      generally any heavy metal/rock music.  I also like a bit of  blues
      on occasion too. Specially after a huge hard drive crash heh heh.</P>
