                               <CENTER>Scots? - Insults</CENTER><P>


      <CENTER>Here  are  a  surprisingly large number of insults about  people's faces!</CENTER><P>


      <CENTER>A face like the back o' a bus. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>A face like the back o' the lum (chimney). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a bashed thripny (an "old" money threepence coin was 
      12-sided). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a burst settee (couch). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a burst melodeon (a kind of accordion). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a flittin (a house removal). </CENTER>
    <CENTER>  A face like a bag o' bruised fruit.</CENTER> 
     <CENTER> A face like a hen layin razors. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a saft tattie (soft potato). </CENTER>
      <CENTER>A face like a skittery hippen (a soiled nappy/diaper). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a torn scone. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a wet washing. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a weel-kickit ba (a well kicked ball). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> A face like a wet nicht lookin' for a dry mornin'.</CENTER> 
<CENTER> A face like a skelpit erse (a smacked bottom). </CENTER> <P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scottish National Heritage suggested that we should to stop  using
      "bog"  in  a derogatory sense as in the countryside these wetlands
      are  an  important  part of the environment.   So  here  are  some
      alternative,   derogatory words (and avoiding  "bog-stalker")   to
      describe an idle person!</P>


     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Aff pitten" - evasive.</P>
 
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Clarty" or "dilly-daw" or "draigled" all mean a dirty or untidy 
      person. "Mrs McClarty" is a slovenly housewife. </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Glaikit" - stupid, silly or thoughtless. It is thought to 
      derive from an old Scots word "glaiks" which meant tricks or 
      deception. </P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Haiver" or "Haver" - dawdle and potter about. "Dinna haiver 
      man" is said to someone who is talking rubbish (in the view of 
      the listener, at least). "Don't give me your havers" is an 
      alternative way of expressing this.</P>
 
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Hither and yon" - untidy and careless.</P>
 
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Horn idle" - nothing to do and completely unemployed.</P>
 
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Midden" - dirty and slovenly. The same word is used for the 
      communal refuse storage area, prior to collection (by the 
      "scaffie"). </P>

                           <CENTER><B>Some words of aggression</B></CENTER><P>


      <CENTER>"Bampot" - an idiot. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>"Bauchle" - a worthless person. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> "A Bessie" - an ill-mannered or bad-tempered female (apologies 
      to all you Elizabeths!). </CENTER>
     <CENTER> "Carnaptious" - irritable or quarrelsome as in "He was right 
      carnaptious old devil!". The word comes from "knap" meaning to 
      bite. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> "Clype" - a tell-tale. </CENTER>
     <CENTER> "Cuddie" - a donkey </CENTER>
<CENTER>"Fecht wi' ones' ain taes" - excessively quarrelsome and a 
      variation on "He would fight with his own shadow" </CENTER>
     <CENTER> "Gomeril" - a fool. </CENTER>

     <CENTER> "Play the loun" - act mischieviously. "Loun" (pronounced 'loon') 
      is the word for a boy in north-east Scotland. </CENTER>
<CENTER> "Puddock" - a term of abuse or contempt as in "The Scotland 
      football team were a load of puddocks". A puddock is a frog. </CENTER>

      Scotland. </CENTER>
