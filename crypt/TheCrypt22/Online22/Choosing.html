<dl><dd><font color=aqua>     This is a little more tricky than first seems.</font>
<P>
<font color=aqua><DD>     Below is a short list of towcars and beside it, a similar list of
caravans that could be suited to them.
<P>
<DD>     The list of cars is simply representative of the current
availability, and there will be many that I've missed. If I included one
vehicle from each range, the list would be enormous!
<P>
<DD>   Likewise, the caravan list.  Those listed are 'vans that were listed
in the Feb 2002 issue of Practical Caravan.

<dl><dd><font color=aqua><DD>     With the sole exception of the Knaus,
these are all British, but there are many more from other countries. 
Adria, Polar, and Freedom hail from Poland. Adria and Polar make some very
nice mid-range kit, whilst the Freedom is aimed at the small car market.
<P>
<DD>      Cabby, Hobby, Lord Munsterland, Burstner, and Tabbert are German, and these
'vans are large, imposing and very luxurious.
<P>
<DD>      The  Spanish  Eriba's are rivals to the more modern Freedom, and
Chateau are a luxurious French manufacturer,  whilst Knaus take their slice
from the mid-range share.
<P>
<DD>      Not  to be outdone,  a Carlight Commander 182 EK will set you back
      a paltry £32,985!  And you need a tank to pull it!  Well,  a Disco
      at least.
<P>
<DD>      All  the above are reasonably well-known in the UK,  but I've only
      ever  seen  one Lord Munsterland over here!  You may also  see  an
      American Airstream;  their bullet-shaped aluminium hull gives them
      a quite distinctive appearance.
<P>
<DD>      Of  the  many 'vans still on the move,  you should also see  names
      like Monza,  Sprite,  ABI,  Cosalt,  Cotswold,  Elddis,  or Perle,
      although  sadly  some  of these manufacturers  have  since  closed
      their doors for the last time.
<P>
<DD>      In no case in the above list, have I ventured over the 85% limit.
There is no legal precedent for this, it just allows a greater margin.  The
law states that no vehicle shall tow a trailer whose MTPLM (Maximum
Technical Permissible Load Mass, or Maximum Gross Weight) is greater than
the unladen weight of the towing vehicle.
<P>
<DD>      Now,  just because your car is capable of 90 mph,  do you drive at
     that speed? No.  It just isn't practical.  So, loading any trailer
      up to 85% is more practical than loading up to 100%.
<P>
<DD>      Taken from the list above, you can legally tow a fully laden Abbey
      Impression  520L (MTPLM 1500 Kg)  with an Omega saloon,   but  the
      whole  outfit  will  weigh over 3 tonnes!  A  Mercedes-Benz  Atego
      flatbed truck could weigh less!
<P>
<DD>      Sometimes,  the numbering behind the names gives a clue as to  the
     'vans length and number of berths.  The Avondale Dart is available
      in 380-2,  470-2, 510-5, 515-4, and 556-6 flavours. The 380-2 is a
      3.80 metre long,  two berth 'van,  the 470-2 is 4.7 metres,  again
      with two berths.  I'm sure that working out the others won't cause
      a panic attack!
<P>
<DD>      The  Avondale Dart 380-2 is easily towed by a 1.6/1.8 Escort/Focus
      size car.
<P>
<DD>      Sometimes,   the listing is augmented by some lettering.   Not  so
      with the Abbey Vogue GTS,  as the GTS is part of the name, but EB,
      (End Bathroom),  EK,  (End Kitchen),  CK,  (Centre Kitchen),   FB,
      (Fixed Bed),  TA (Twin Axle), are self-explanatory. The reason for
      this  is  so  that  a  prospective buyer can tell  the  difference
      between  models  with an end kitchen or an  end  bed.   A  married
      couple  with 3 young children may choose a 4-berth 'van  with  two
      double beds rather than a similar five-berth with a bunk bed,   as
      the layouts will almost certainly differ.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Images/van1.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Van2">
<DD>      On  another  ng CLIC (Campers Live Internet Chat),  a  nice  young
      lady  and  her husband tow a Dart 475-4 with a Renault Scenic  1.9
      DTi.  The 'van weighs around 1250 Kg max,  and to stay within  the
      85% scale,  the Scenic ought to weigh 1470 Kg.  But the Renault is
      much  lighter than that!  The owners have had some of the original
      kit  taken  out  of  the  Avondale,  and they  don't  load  it  to
      capacity,  but they're still on 95%! They're looking for something
      a bit more substantial to tow with now.
<P>
<DD>      The number of berths is quite important,  honest!  If there's five
      of you,  you'll need to be very intimately acquainted to sleep  in
      the same caravan, and if you weren't, well, you soon will be!
<P>
      Conversely,  if there's only two of you, a six-berth 'van may be a
      bit much.
<P>
<DD>      Again,   having said that,  on Clic,  another crony has a Vauxhall
      Monterey  (Isuzu Trooper)  and he drags an Eccles  Elite  Searcher
      around.   This beastie is 21 feet long (6.35 metres)   and  has  a
      permanent bed at the back.  When coupled up,  this outfit  is  the
      same length as a bus,  and it's performance is about as sparkling,
      as  the  Monty  weighs  around 2300 Kg  and  the  Searcher  weighs
      another  1700,  so the whole thing gross' at nearly 4 tonnes!   He
      reckons it's adequate for him and his wife.
<P>
<DD>      Well,   their  main  holiday is 3 weeks in France  (they  live  in
      Torry)   and  he's a Pipe Major,  so they do competitions  several
      times  a  year.  The fixed bed is much kinder to his back  than  a
      traditional caravan bed.
<P>
<DD>      A  larger  caravan with a fixed bed has some advantages  and  some
      disadvantages.   One advantage is that a  fixed  bed  usually  has
      something a little more substantial around it than a curtain.  So,
      if  someone isn't feeling well,  or is simply tired,  they can  go
      and  have  a  lie  down.  Another is that the bed  hasn't  got  to
      fulfill a dual role, that of night-time bed, and day-time seating.
      A  disadvantage  is,   if you go on a club  'rally'  with  several
      others,   you  can't  'entertain' as you could  in  a  differently
      specced 'van.
<P>
<DD>      A rally simply means that a herd of 'vanners gather together in  a
      field,  where an early morning dump is usually followed by a  howl
      of  pain  as  the  unfortunate discovers that behind  the  'toilet
      bush' is a clump of thistles.... Talk about a sting in the tail!
<P>
<DD>      One way of increasing the capacity of any caravan is to attach  an
      awning.  Awnings are available in three main flavours;  full,  the
      same length as the 'van,  midi,  about half the length, and porch,
      which is about 2 metres square.
<P>
<DD>      A full awning can be sub-divided like a large tent,  and have some
      more  sleeping compartments if that is what is needed.  Or a table
      and chairs.  Or can be used as a sun-lounge, or simply as external
      storage.
<P>
<DD>      The better-known awnings are made by Bradcot,  NR,  Isabella,  and
      Dorema, although there are many more on the market.
<P>
<DD>      So,  how do you actually choose a caravan? Well, take into account
      your  towcar,  size of family,  and budget,  and lop off all those
      that fall outside the remit.
<P>
<DD>      Towcar. To find the weight of it, either trundle off to your local
      weighbridge  and  physically   weigh  the  thing,   look  in  your
      handbook,  or ask a car or caravan dealer. Then divide by 100, and
      multiply that by 85. That gives you the 85% that you need.
<P>
<DD>      If your budget is,  say,  £750 and you have a Clio or similar, you
      can  get  a reasonable late Sprite 400 or early Cadet.  The  Cadet
      range replaced the 400,  and has only 3 berths to the 400's 4. You
      won't  have an inside washroom or loo,  so,  you'll have to either
      a)   buy  a  toilet tent,  b)  go to sites where  they  have  such
      facilities, or c) beware of thistles!
<p>
<DD>      If your finances will stretch to £1500-£2000,  a Perle Orestes (3-
      berth)  or a 2-berth Freedom Microlite, are within your grasp, but
      if  you can scrape more than £3k together,  then you could have  a
      very early Abbey Iona with 4 pits, or a cheapish Compass Lynx.
<P>
<DD>      If  you've got more than about £4-£5000,  then new 'vans could  be
      the  order of the day,  as a brand new Freedom starts from  around
      £5k.
<P>
<DD>      If  you  have  an Astra/Escort sized tug,  and a budget  of  under
      £1000,   a  Perle Argos,  Cavalier 390T,  or Monza 1200  could  be
      suited.   Caravans  of  this  size will  usually  have  an  inside
      loo/washroom.
<P>
<DD>      In the price range £1500-£2000,  an Abbey Lincoln or Avondale Leda
      can be had.
<P>
<DD>      Any Sprite Alpine shouldn't cost more than about £1500.
<P>
<DD>      Assuming you have a Mondeo/Laguna sized car,  for up to £1k,   you
      could  choose  between  a Windrush,  Monza  1400  or  an  ABI  Ace
      Globetrotter.
<P>
<DD>      £2k  could  get  you a Hobby Prestige,  Sprite Musketeer,   or  an
      Avondale Leda,  whilst another thou can secure a good Lunar Solar,
      Elddis Avante, or a Fleetwood Colchester.
<P>
<DD>      £4000 puts you in Swift Challenger/Lunar Clubman territory.
<P>
<DD>      With  a Granada size towcar and less than £2k,  you could  be  the
      proud  owner of a 6-berth Sprite Major or Eccles Amethyst.  Double
      that, and Burstners and Carlights are within reach.
<P>
<DD>      If you add money to the above prices,  you can start adding kit to
      the  basic caravans.  You need to add maybe £2-£300 for an awning,
      £150 for the mains hook-up,  £350 for central heating,  £100 for a
      shower...  the list goes on. Just think sensibly about your needs,
      and  if  this is your first time 'vanning,  keep making  lists  of
      things you'd like to add while you're away.
<P>
<DD>      There is no reason why you can't take a TV, and video, as 12 volt
models of both are available, as are microwave ovens!</DD>
