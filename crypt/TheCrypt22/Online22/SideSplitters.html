      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  young ventriloquist is touring the clubs, and one night he's doing
      a  show in a small town in Indiana.  With his dummy on his knee, he's
      going  through his usual dumb blonde jokes when a blonde woman in the
      4th  row stands on her chair and starts shouting:  "I've heard enough
      of  your  stupid  blonde  jokes.  What makes you think you can stereo
      type women that way?  What does the colour of a person's hair have to
      do with her worth as a being?  It's guys like you who keep women like
      me  from being respected at work, in the community, and from reaching
      our  full potential as a person because you and your kind continue to
      perpetuate  discrimination  against  not  only  blondes, but women in
      general....and all in the name of humour!"</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  embarrassed  ventriloquist  begins to apologize, when the blonde
      yells,  "You  stay  out  of this, mister!  I'm talking to that little
      bastard on your knee!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  man  guesses  there  must  be  thousands  of  dollars  in it and
      approaches the bartender to ask:  What's up with the jar?</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Bartender:   Well,  you  pay ten dollars and if you pass three tests,
      then you get all the money.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Man:  What are the three tests?</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Bartender:  Pay first.  Those are the rules.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Bartender:  OK, here's what you have to do.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">First,  you  have  to  drink that whole gallon of pepper tequila, the
      WHOLE thing at once, and you can't make a face while doing it.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Second,  there  is  a  pit  bull  chained  up  out  back  with a sore
      tooth........  you have to remove the tooth with your bare hands.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Third,  there  is  a  90  year  old woman upstairs who's never had an
      orgasm in her life.  You gotta make things right for her.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Man:   Well,  I  know  I've paid my ten bucks but I'm not an idiot, I
      won't  do  it.   You have to be nuts to drink a gallon of tequila and
      then get crazier from there.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Bartender:  It's your call.  But your money stays in the jar.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well,  as  time goes on and the man drinks a few, he asks...  "Wherez
      zat  teeqeelah?"  He  grabs the gallon of tequila with both hands and
      downs  it with a big slurp.  Tears are streaming down his cheeks, but
      he doesn't make a face.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next  he staggers out back and soon all the people inside hear a huge
      scuffle going on.  They hear barking and screams, yelps and growling,
      and  eventually silence.  Just when they think the man must surely be
      dead,  he  staggers  back  into  the  bar,  his  shirt ripped and big
      scratches all over his body.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Ok, NOW", he says, "where's that old broad with the sore tooth?"</P>

             <font color=aqua><CENTER>The Secrets of Women's Language - A must-read for any man</CENTER>
<P>      
     <CENTER> Keywords and their meanings:</CENTER>
<P>      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Fine":  <font color=aqua>  This  is the word we use at the end of any argument that we
      feel  we  are right about but need to shut you up.  NEVER use fine to
      describe  how  woman looks.  This will cause you to have one of those
      arguments.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Five  minutes":  <font color=aqua> This is half an hour.  It is equivalent to the five
      minutes  that your football game is going to last before you take out
      the trash, so it's an even trade.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Nothing":  <font color=aqua> This  means  something  and  you should be on your toes.
      "Nothing"  is  usually  used  to  describe the feeling a woman has of
      wanting   to  turn  you  inside  out,  upside  down,  and  backwards.
      "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last "Five Minutes"
      and end with the word "Fine".</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Go  Ahead"  <font color=aqua> (with  raised eyebrows):  This is a dare.  One that will
      result  in a woman getting upset over "Nothing" and will end with the
      word "Fine."</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Go Ahead" <font color=aqua>(normal eyebrows):  This means "I give up" or "do what you
      want because I don't care".  You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead"
      in  just a few minutes, followed by "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will
      talk to you in about "Five Minutes" when she cools off.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Loud  Sigh):  <font color=aqua>  This  is  not  actually  a word, but is still often a
      verbal  statement very misunderstood by men.  A "Loud Sigh" means she
      thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting
      her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing".</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Soft  Sigh):  <font color=aqua>  Again,  not  a  word,  but a verbal statement.  "Soft
      Sighs"  are  one of the few things that some men actually understand.
      She is content.  Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will
      stay content.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Oh": <font color=aqua> This word followed by any statement is trouble.  Example; "Oh,
      let  me get that." Or, "Oh, I talked to him about what you were doing
      last  night."  If she says "Oh" before a statement, RUN, do not walk,
      to  the  nearest exit.  She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she
      is done tossing your clothes out the window, but do not expect her to
      talk  to  you  for  at  least 2 days.  "Oh" as the lead to a sentence
      usually  signifies  that  you are caught in a lie.  Do not try to lie
      more  to  get  out  of it, or you will get raised eyebrows "Go ahead"
      followed  by  acts  so  unspeakable  that we can't bring ourselves to
      write about them.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"That's  Okay":  <font color=aqua>  This is one of the most dangerous statements that a
      woman can say to a man.  "That's Okay," means that she wants to think
      long and hard before paying you retributions for what ever it is that
      you  have done.  "That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and
      used  in  conjunction with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point
      in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to
      be in some mighty big trouble.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Please  Do": <font color=aqua>   This  is not a statement, it is an offer.  A woman is
      giving  you  the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you
      have  for  doing  whatever it is that you have done.  You have a fair
      chance  to  tell  the  truth,  so  be careful and you shouldn't get a
      "That's Okay".</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
     <font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Thanks":  <font color=aqua>  A  woman  is thanking you.  Do not faint; just say you're
      welcome.</font></P><font color=aqua>
      
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Thanks  a  lot": <font color=aqua>  This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will
      say,  "Thanks  a  lot"  when  she  is  really  ticked off at you.  It
      signifies  that  you  have  hurt her in some callous way, and will be
      followed  by  the  "Loud  Sigh."  Be careful not to ask what is wrong
      after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only tell you "Nothing."</font></P><font color=aqua>
