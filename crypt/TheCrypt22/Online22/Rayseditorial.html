                   <font color=purple> <CENTER>A Very Big welcome to a Very Big edition.</CENTER>
<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes,  folks this edition is our largest yet filling up 7 floppy disks
      and  using  up  some  five and a half megabytes of crunched data.  We
      have  96  articles  for you to read and 126 Pictures for you to view.
      Amiga users also have three background music modules to listen to.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How  did we get to do so much in such a short space of time?  Well it
      was  bloody  hard work I can tell you, but we didn't do it alone.  We
      had the help of the finest and hardest working group of men and women
      an  Editor could ever hope to work with.  I am of course referring to
      The Team that make up<font color=lime> RIYAN Productions.</font></P><font color=lime>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  thanks  go  out  to  each and everyone of you at<font color=lime> RIYAN<font color=aqua> who's hard
      work,  determination  and  dedication makes this magazine what it is,
      the best read on the internet.</font></font></P><font color=lime><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But we at<font color=lime> RIYAN<font color=aqua> can't take all the credit our selves, because YOU the
      reader  played  a huge part too.  Just scan through our pages and see
      just  how many articles and pictures you the reader submitted.  Again
      an Editors dream come true.  My thanks go out to each and everyone of
      you as well.</font></font></P><font color=lime><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now Ian has already mentioned the changes within<font color=lime> RIYAN<font color=aqua> Productions so
      I  won't repeat the information all over again.  However I would like
      to wish Steve Hyde and Craig Daines well in their new ventures and of
      course  welcome newcomers Kathy Danby and Bruce Steers into the fold.
      With  the  re-organisation  within <font color=lime> RIYAN<font color=aqua> I know that we can all look
      forward to new and exciting things in future editions.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=lime><font color=aqua><font color=lime><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of the most exciting changes that I am looking forward to is the
      creation of the next edition.  As Ian explained this is the very last
      time we will be using DMC (Disk Magazine Creator) Farewell old friend
      you  have  served  us  well.  HTML a strange new beast that I know so
      little about will takes its place.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  will  this  "foreign"  language do for the <font color=red>CRYPT<font color=aqua>?  Well it will
      make  the  magazine  truly  compatible  on  both  the  Amiga  and  PC
      platforms.   We will no longer be restricted to low resolution screen
      displays of just 16 colours and Ian says it's dead easy to use!!</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  can  have  pictures  embedded within the text and articles can be
      linked  to  others within the magazine if we should require to do so.
      On  line with the new version will link you to other sites too.  Wow,
      can't do any of that with the old DMC program.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  me  I  see  it  as  a challenge, as I will now no longer as Dual
      Editor  be  restricted  to an old disk based program.  OK so I have a
      new  language  to  learn but I'm sure I will master it.  What it will
      mean  is  that  don't  have  to  write  two  versions of the magazine
      anymore,  (Amiga  disk  and hard drive) that alone will free up extra
      time  to  spend  on  the imput of the magazine.  I look forward to it
      very much.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  will  find  many  new  features in this edition.  Crypt Cuisine,
      Amiga  On-line and North of the Border being just some of them.  No I
      won't tell you about them here, you will have to read them yourself.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally  I  hope  that  you  all enjoy this edition as much as we all
      enjoyed  putting it all together for you.  Go on what are you waiting
      for ....  Read the<font color=red> CRYPT 22</font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>
