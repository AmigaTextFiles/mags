<P>
     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Tread gently on anyone who looks at you sideways.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Have lots of long lie-ins.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wear  sturdy socks, learn to grow out of medium underwear and, if you
      must  lie  about your age, do it in the other direction:  tell people
      you're ninety-seven and they'll think you look fucking great.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try  to  catch a trout and experience the glorious feeling of letting
      it  go  and  seeing it swimming away.  Never eat food that comes in a
      bucket.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">If  you  don't  know  how to meditate at least try to spend some time
      every day just sitting.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Boo joggers.  Don't work out, work in.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Play the banjo.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Sleep with somebody you like.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Eat plenty of Liquorice Allsorts.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Try to live in a place you like.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Marry somebody you like.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Try" to do a job you like.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Never  turn down an opportunity to shout, 'Fuck them all!' at the top
      of your voice.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Avoid bigots of all descriptions.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Let  your  own bed become to you what the Pole Star was to sailors of
      old ...  look forward to it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't wear tight underwear on aeroplanes.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Before  you  judge  a man, walk a mile in his shoes.  After that, who
      cares?  ...  He's a mile away and you've got his shoes.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Clean  your  teeth  and  keep the company of people who will tell you
      when there's spinach on them.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Avoid people who say they know the answer.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Keep the company of people who are trying to understand the question.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Don't pat animals with sneaky eyes.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> If you haven't heard a good rumour by 11 a.m., start one.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Learn   to   feel  sorry  for  music  because,  although  it  is  the
      international language, it has no swearwords.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">If  you  write  a book, be sure it has exactly seventy-six' fuck's in
      it.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Avoid giving LSD to guide dogs.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Don't be talked into wearing a uniform.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Salute nobody.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Never run with scissors or other pointy objects.</P>




     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Campaign against blue Smarties.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Above  all,  go to Glasgow at least once in your life and have a roll
      and  square  sliced  sausage and a cup of tea.  When you feel the tea
      coursing  over your spice-singed tongue, you'll know what I mean when
      I say:  'It's good to be alive!'. "</P>
