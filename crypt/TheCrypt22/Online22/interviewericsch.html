<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> What's your full name and handle?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Eric W. Schwartz</P>


     <font color=aqua> <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Where do you come from and where do you live currently?</P>

       <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">I  have  lived all my life (except for my years in college) in Dayton
      Ohio, USA.</P>


       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Tell us a little bit about yourself...  (age, hobby's, grown up...)</P>

     <font color=yellow> <P ALIGN="LEFT"> There's  not  much  to tell.  I'm 30 years old, I work as a freelance
      artist, and I enjoy drawing and toy collecting.</P>



      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> When  did  you  start your career in "cartooning" and animating small
      stories?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  have  always  enjoyed drawing as long as I can remember, and tried
      animation  as  a  hobby.   Now  I try to get work in illustration and
      animation.</P>


 <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> How did it came that you're such a good Cartoonist?  You grew up with
      Disney?  :o)</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  watched  a lot of cartoons when I was growing up, such as those by
      Disney  and Warner Brothers.  Many of my early drawings were based on
      those  cartoons and comic strips, and I tried to emulate their style.
      My own style grew from that.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Why  is your female Cartoon-Star named "Sabrina"?  Is there a special
      reason for this?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> There  was  no  special  reason for the name to my knowledge.  It was
      suggested by a friend.</P>


     <font color=aqua> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> All your animations and comics are available for the Commodore Amiga.
      Since  when  are  you an owner of the fabulous Amiga System?  What do
      you think about it's abilities?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  have  been  an  Amiga owner since 1989.  I like the system for its
      graphics  and  animation  capability and software.  I also prefer the
      efficiency  of the operating system over other systems.  Now I use an
      A4000T with a Cyberstorm 68060/PPC and a Cybervision video card.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Where are people able to get some of your comics/animations/cartoons?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Now I concentrate on my comic strip at <A HREF="http://www.sabrina-online.com">http://www.sabrina- online.com </A>
     It has links to other sites where my works can be found.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Are  there some new productions (cartoons) in progress?  If yes, tell
      us a bit about it...</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  I  have  at  least  one animation project I would like to finish.  It
      stars  Sabrina.  I don't want to say too much about it, in case there
      are problems getting it finished.</P>


     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">  Will  you  support the Amiga community with cartoons in the future as
      you did it in the past?  :o)</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  would like to, but animation takes a lot of time and effort to do.
      I  have  been kept busy with work and other projects, and it has been
      difficult to get back to animation.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> What's your opinion about the current situation of the Amiga?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  think the Amiga is at the lowest point it has been in a long time.
      I  hope future developments can help revive the platform and bring it
      into the future.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> What  do  you think about AmigaOne, AmigaDE or the currently released
      AmigaXL for x86 computers?</P>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  I  think they all show promise.  I look forward especially to systems
      like  the  AmigaOne  or  BPlan's  system,  which  use  the  newer PPC
      processors.   I  also  like  the  idea  of using the AmigaXL on a x86
      laptop or similar.</P>


     <font color=aqua>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Do you plan to buy something of the above? If yes, why?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  am  considering buying one or more of the new Amiga systems, but I
      would  like to see them first before I spend the money.  I would like
      a  faster,  better  Amiga system, hopefully one with a future.  I may
      get AmigaXL as well, and put it on an inexpensive laptop PC.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Any ideas you want to tell the Amiga industry?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  think  Amiga  should  keep  up  with hardware, and help to provide
      drivers  for printers, scanners, and PCI cards.  I would also like to
      see good video creation and editing software like that found on other
      platforms.  An expanded version of Multiview, with better support for
      sound, video, and animation codecs, making it a better 'media player'
      than those found on other machines.</P>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> How  can  our  readers  get  in contact with you?  Do you have a web-
      adress?</P>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"> I can't think of anything at this time. :)</P>


       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Thank  you for your time and answering my questions.  Best wishes and
      regards Andi</P>
