     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> There  are  these  two  friends,  a  white  guy and a black guy.  One
      evening, they're in a bar arguing over which of them can have sex the
      most times in one night.  They decide to settle the issue by going to
      the local whorehouse and gathering experimental evidence, as it were.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So  they get to the whorehouse, pair off with a couple of the ladies,
      and  go to their respective rooms.  The white guy energetically balls
      his  whore  and, reaching up with a pencil, makes a " | " mark on the
      wall.   Then  he  falls asleep.  He wakes up in a couple of hours and
      screws  the  whore  again, albeit a little less enthusiastically this
      time.   Again, he reaches back and marks a " | " on the wall.  Again,
      he falls asleep.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  wakes  up  again in a couple of hours and lethargically humps the
      hooker  again.  He drowsily marks another " | " on the wall and falls
      asleep for the rest of the night.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  next  morning, the black guy barges into the white guy's room to
      see  how  he  did.   He  takes  one look at the wall and exclaims, "A
      hundred and eleven?!  Wow!  You beat me by three!"</P>

      in Spain, they name him "Juan".  Years later, Juan sends a picture of
      himself  to  his  mum.   Upon  receiving  the  picture, she tells her
      husband  that she wished she also had a picture of Amal.  Her husband
