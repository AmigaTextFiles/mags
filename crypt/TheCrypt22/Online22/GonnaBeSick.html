      <font color=green><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  woman  went  through  the drive thru of Burger King for lunch a
      couple  of  years  ago.   She ordered a chicken sandwich (the breaded
      kind...before spicy chicken or grilled chicken became big sellers for
      BK) and specifically requested NO MAYO because she couldn't stand the
      stuff.   She  drove  away  without  confirming  that she got what she
      ordered.   As  she  drove, she began to eat the sandwich and realized
      that there was mayo on it.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  was  none  too pleased but was so hungry that she ate it anyway.
      When  she  got  about halfway through the sandwich, she began to feel
      very ill.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">She  stopped  eating  the sandwich but felt increasingly worse as she
      continued to drive.</P>






     
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  felt  so  bad  that  she drove herself to the hospital emergency
      room.   She  took her sandwich with her since she started feeling bad
      after eating the sandwich.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  hospital  performed tests on both her and the sandwich and found
      out the following...the sandwich actually didn't have any mayo on it.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">In reality, the chicken had a tumour on its breast.  When the chicken
      was  breaded  and  fried, the tumour burst inside the breaded chicken
      breast.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  mayo-like  substance was actually puss from the tumour.  Kind of
      makes you want to swear off fast food and mayo, doesn't it!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  girl was really in a hurry one day so she just stopped off at a
      Taco  Bell  and  got  a Chicken soft taco and ate it on the way home.
      That  night  she  noticed her jaw was kind of tight and swollen.  The
      next  day  it  was a little worse so she went to her doctor.  He said
      she  was  just  having an allergic reaction to something and gave her
      some cream to rub on her jaw to help.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  a  couple  of  days the swelling had just gotten worse and she
      could  hardly  move her jaw.  She went back to her doctor to see what
      was wrong.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her  doctor  had  no  idea  so  he  started  to run some tests.  They
      scrubbed  out  the inside of her mouth to get tissue samples and they
      also took some saliva samples.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well,  they  found  out  what was wrong.  Apparently her chicken soft
      taco  had  a pregnant cockroach in the one she ate!!!!  The eggs then
      somehow got into her saliva glands and she was incubating them.  They
      had  to remove a couple layers of her inner mouth to get all the eggs
      out.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  they  hadn't  figured  out what was going on, the eggs would have
      hatched inside the lining of her mouth!!!!!!!!!!</P>

      <font color=white><CENTER>Excerpted  from an article which appeared in the Dublin Times about a
      bank robbery on March 2, 1999:</CENTER>
<P>     
      <font color=green><P ALIGN="LEFT">Once  inside  the  bank  shortly  after  midnight,  their  efforts at
      disabling the internal security system got underway immediately.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  robbers, who expected to find one or two large safes filled with
      cash  and  valuables, were surprised to see hundreds of smaller safes
      scattered throughout the bank.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  robbers  cracked  the  first safe's combination, and inside they
      found  only  a  bowl  of  vanilla pudding.  As recorded on the bank's
      audio  tape  system,  one  robber said, "At least we'll have a bit to
      eat."</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  robbers  opened  up a second safe, and it also contained nothing
      but  vanilla pudding.  The process continued until all the safes were
      opened.   They found not one pound sterling, a diamond or an ounce of
      gold.</P>
      
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, all the safes contained covered bowls of pudding.</P>





     
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Disappointed,  the  robbers  made  a  quiet  exit,  each leaving with
      nothing more than a queasy, uncomfortably full stomach.</P>
