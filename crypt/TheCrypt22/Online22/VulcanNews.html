<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">(1) Persona Symbology</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- This version sees the return of those special symbols for specific personas within
the Community Decks. In the next version of the Portal we will have more
information on what each symbol means, but for now they allow you to quickly
identify key Personas such as Vulcan Staff, BiLocal Staff, Portal Ambassadors,
Portal Services, Commercial Web Owners and Unofficial Portal Web Owners.</P> 

<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">(2) Unique Security & Mail Servers</P> 

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- This version uses specific Security and Mail Servers depending on where you live
within the Vulcan Orbiter. What does this mean? Well basically it means that you
will be sharing specific Servers with only 2,000 other Portal Users, the end result
should be quicker connection times and lower congestion. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only downside to this improvement, is that if you ever post 3dVoiceMail to
people who live four decks apart, then a connection to a unique Mail Server will
have to take place between posts. However, early tests prove this to be quite fast. </P>

<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">(3) Reporting And Deck 27</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> - This version allows access to new Portal Personas who will slowly be filling up
Deck 27 and beyond and also has improved reporting specifically when problems
occur when connecting to the many Vulcan Servers. </P>

<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">(4) One Year? No Way!</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version marks a special occasion for Vulcan as it is exactly one year ago that
we released the very first version of the Vulcan Portal. </P>
 
<font color=silver><P ALIGN="LEFT">(5) Need Help ?</P>
