      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Scots pancakes are cooked on a hot girdle (gridle in Britain) and are
      entirely different to crepes (also known as pancakes in Britain).</P>



                                   <CENTER><B>Ingredients</B></CENTER>
<P>
        <CENTER>8 oz. plain white flour</CENTER>
        <CENTER>2 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda</CENTER>
       <CENTER> Large pinch of salt</CENTER>
        <CENTER>1 tablespoon castor sugar</CENTER>
       <CENTER> 2 tablespoons oil</CENTER>
<CENTER> 1 egg</CENTER> 
        <CENTER>Milk to mix</CENTER>
<P>



                                  <CENTER><B> Directions</B></CENTER>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Heat the girdle and grease lightly.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sift  all  the flour and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl.  Add in the
      castor  sugar,  oil,  egg and a little milk.  Stir into the flour and
      add  enough  milk  to  make a thick creamy mixture, approximately the
      consistency of very thick double cream.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the hot girdle and cook until they
      bubble  on  top.  Turn and cook on the other side until golden brown.
      While  cooking  the  rest  of  the  mixture store the cooked pancakes
      between  a  small  folded towel.  Serve the warm pancakes with butter
      and preserves.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> In the unlikely event of there being any left-overs should be kept in
      an air tight container.</P>
