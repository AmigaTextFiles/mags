<font color=red><H1> <CENTER>Nine Things I Hate About Everyone</CENTER></H1>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. <font color=aqua>People who point at their wrist while asking for the time.... 
      I know where my watch is pal, where the fuck is yours? Do I 
      point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is? </P>

<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.<font color=aqua> People who are willing to get off their ass to search 
      the entire house for the tv remote because they refuse to 
      walk to the tv and change the channel manually. </P>
 
<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.<font color=aqua> When people say, "Oh you just want to have your cake and 
      eat it too". Damn right! What good is a cake if you can't 
      eat it? </P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.<font color=aqua> When people say, "It's always the last place you look". 
      Of course it is. Why the fuck would you keep looking after 
      you've found it? Do people actually do this? Who and where 
      are these idioits? Gonna Kick their ass! </P>
 
<font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.<font color=aqua> When people say while watching a film, "Did you see that?". 
      No Losser, I paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the 
      fucking floor.</P>




<font color=white><P ALIGN="LEFT"> 6. <font color=aqua>People who ask, "Can I ask you a question?".... Didn't 
      really give me a choice there, did ya sunshine? </P>

      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.<font color=aqua> When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If 
      it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If 
      it's an improvement, then there must have been something 
      before it. </P>

     <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 8.<font color=aqua>When people say, "Life is short". What the fuck?? Life 
      is the longest damn thing anyone ever fucking does!! What 
      can you do that's longer? </P>
 
      <font color=white><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.<font color=aqua> When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks, "Has the 
      bus come yet?". If the bus came would I be standing here, 
      dumass? </P>
