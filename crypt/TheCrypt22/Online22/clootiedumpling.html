<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boil  the  cloth  for a few minutes and then spread it out on a table
      (use tongs etc.  to prevent burning yourself).  quickly sprinkle with
      about  a  tablespoonful of wholemeal flour and toss the flour to coat
      the main centre of the cloth quite thickly.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stir  the  treacle  into the eggs and then place into a bowl with all
      the  other  ingredients  and mix to a stiff consistency with a little
      water.  Place in the centre of the cloth.  Bring up the edges and tie
      with  a  string,  leaving  a  little  space  for expansion due to the
      inclusion of the baking powder.  Hold the tied ends and pat the cloth
      into a round shape.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Place  the  pudding  into  a  pot of boiling water, which should come
      halfway   up  the  side.   Cover  and  simmer  gently  for  4  hours.
      Occasionally check and top up the water if necessary.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  the  pudding  is cooked plunge it into cold water for about one
      minute  to  release  it from the cloth.  Remove the pudding to a bowl
      and untie, cover with a plate and reverse it.  Peel off the cloth and
      place the pudding into a hot oven to dry off the skin.</P>




      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Serve  hot  with  any  accompaniment  to like (custard, brandy butter
      etc.).   Any  left-over  Clootie  dumpling  may  be sliced and fried,
      alternatively wrap in foil and re-heat in an oven (if re-heating in a
      microwave oven do not wrap in foil).</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> NB.   If  this dumpling is being made for Christmas or New Year a few
      silver  coins  can  be added to the mixture (wrapped in foil) for the
      children to find but be careful when serving to young children!</P></font></font>
