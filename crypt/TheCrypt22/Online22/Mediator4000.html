     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Finally,  after  a  few months waiting, Elbox released their Mediator
      4000  "core logic" card.  I ordered mine and it arrived the next day,
      so I opened up my machine and figured out how to install it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  package  came  with  the  Medaitor 4000 itself, the MultiMedia CD
      which has drivers for TV cards, sound cards and 100Mb ethernet cards,
      and  a replacement busboard for my A4000 tower.  The new busboard has
      both seven Zorro II/III slots and five PCI slots, as well as a single
      video  slot.   One  of  the  Zorro III slots is used by the Mediator,
      which  also  connects  to  a  special  PCI  slot,  although there are
      actually still five usable PCI slots in total.  This is one more than
      the  A1200 version of the Mediator, which is a little frustrating for
      some  A1200  owners  who have already got hold of a graphics card, TV
      card, sound card and ethernet card, and so now have no free slots.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  Mediator  has  three  jumpers on it.  One is for setting the PCI
      memory  window  size, which can be either 256MB or 512MB.  Unless you
      have  a  Voodoo 4 or 5, 256MB is the recommended setting.  The second
      jumper  is for controlling the order in which the Mediator configures
      itself  at  boot  time.   You  only need to change this if you have a
      Zorro  III  graphics  card,  which I do.  The final jumper is for use
      with the Shark G4 board that Elbox are set to release.</P>



     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If  you  look  closely at the picture PCI/Zorro busboard, you can see
      that  it  has  a  power  connector labeled "P9".  Presumably this was
      included  to provide another power source for the busboard, so as not
      to  overload  the  power  lines from the A4000 motherboard connector.
      It's probably a good idea too, since you could in theory run up to 12
      cards  at  once.   However,  since  my tower is an RBM Digitaltechnik
      TowerHawk  it uses an ATX PSU, and the P9 connector is from an old AT
      style  supply.   Luckily,  I  had  an old AT supply handy to raid for
      parts, and found the pin outs for P9 in the Hardware Book Online.  P9
      carries  three  voltages:   +5V, GND and -5V.  Fortunately, I noticed
      that  the -5V line is not connected to anything on the busboard, so I
      only needed to supply the other two voltages which I took from one of
      the  standard  5.25" power connectors in my tower.  I quickly made up
      an adaptor cable:</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I removed all my Zorro cards from my computer, and took my old 7 slot
      Zorro busboard out.  The new PCI busboard fitted nicely, although the
      mounting  screw holes did not line up correctly so I had to carefully
      support it with cable ties.  It's fairly solid now.</P>




      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I had feared, the holes at the back of my tower did not align with
      the  slots  on  the new busboard correctly.  They were about 1cm out,
      but  I  had  already planned for this and knew what I had to do.  The
      rear   part  of  the  tower  is  made  of  two  metal  sections,  and
      unfortunatly  it was impossible to move the slot holes or adjust them
      easily,  so  I  simply removed the offending metal crossbeams.  I did
      this  with  my trusty Dremel-clone, and it generally worked out quite
      well.   I  can  still  support the cards with screws, and the lack of
      crossbeams is no worse than most other towers.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After powering up with just the busboard in place, I checked that the
      power connector was okay and nothing was getting hot.  As nothing was
      wrong,  I installed a Zorro card and tried that.  Still all okay so I
      put  in my PicassoIV and made sure I had a picture from it.  Finally,
      I  fitted  the  rest  of  the  Zorro  cards  back in and attached the
      Mediator.   An early startup screen revealed a long list of expansion
      cards,  and  listexp  from the Identify.library package showed up two
      new  Elbox cards.  "Two?" you ask?  Well, the Mediator configs twice,
      once  for  PCI  memory  space  and once for it's own control register
      space.</P>







     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Finally,  I  tried out a PCI 10Mb ethernet card.  I had it working in
      moments,  and  could ping all the other computers on my home network.
      I  am  now  waiting for a Voodoo 3, at which point I will update this
      site again.</P>
