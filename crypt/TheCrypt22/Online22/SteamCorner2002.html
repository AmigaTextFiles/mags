     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Firstly,  a  Happy  New  Year  to  everyone  !  Hello again.  In this
      edition,  we  bring  you  a  closer  insight  about  Chief Mechanical
      Engineers,  footplatemen,  and  a  little railway humour.  Thanks for
      inclusions  go  to  Simon Smalley, Tony Wood, of the Watercress line,
      and numerous others for information gathered.</P>

                             <CENTER>A Footplate Experience</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  steam  loco  requires  a  lot  of  preparation  before  it  can be
      effectively  used.   This  should give you, the reader, an insight to
      what  occurred  "behind  the  scenes",  and  still  does on preserved
      railways; the exception being the call-up.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raising  steam  was the job of lower grades in the "shed".  This is a
      job  which  can't  be  hurried,  as  the  loco  has to expand evenly.
      Usually,  the  loco  had  been  left  with a full boiler and the fire
      "dropped"  into  the  ash-pit  by the last crew.  This practice meant
      that  raising  steam  was  somewhat easier for the improvers, without
      having  to  top-up  the  boiler  as required before lighting up.  The
      water  level  in the boiler could be gauged by means of a level glass
      mounted in the cab.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As steam pressure increased toward working pressure, callers would be
      sent  to  fetch  crewmen  from  their homes or lodgings.  The callers
      would  normally  be apprentices in their first positions in the shed,
      and  had  to  be  fairly fit as little time could be wasted.  Callers
      weren't always popular, either; resulting in a chase back to the shed
      and an alternative "Queen's English" being demonstrated.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once at the shed, the crewmen would sign on, and be allocated a loco.
      They would collect their tokens for the machine and exchange them for
      the  necessary  tools,  lubricants,  etc.   They would then check for
      alterations  of  their  "road" and then on to checking and oiling the
      loco.   This involved lubricating all bearings, checking the fire for
      an  even burn, coal and water levels, etc., steam leaks, washing down
      the  smokebox  platform  and  footplate and fitting lamps to donate a
      light  engine.   The crew would then move the loco to the water tower
      and coaling stage as appropriate, then to the turntable if required.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When  this was completed, the signalman would be 'phoned and the loco
      manoeuvred  to  it's  required  position  on  the instructions of the
      signalman.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It wasn't uncommon for crews to spend considerable hours on duty, and
      the  answer to this came in the form of a firing shovel, cleaned in a
      steam  ejector  jet,  greased, and eggs, bacon and sausages fried and
      served with thick, crusty bread.  Hot drinks were provided by keeping
      a  caddy  on  the  oil-warmer,  which  does a stirling job of warming
      anything.   The  only  problem concerning this variety of cooking was
      that if someone opened the regulator, it went up in smoke !  It seems
      that preservation crews still carry on this legacy.</P>

                                     <CENTER>Fireman</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  fireman  was  a  crucial  part  of  the  team.   He  shared  the
      responsibilities  of  the locomotive and train, and a good crew would
      be  elevated  to  the  position of "Top- link".  The "Top-link" crews
      would  be  selected  for  crack express duties, Royal trains, and the
      like.   Apart  from keeping the fire in good order and keeping an eye
      on  steam  pressure, water levels, vacuum pressure, etc., he was also
      in  charge  of  "taking  water".  This required a watchful eye, as an
      overfill would give the crew an early bath.</P>

                           <CENTER>Chief Mechanical Engineers</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir  Nigel Gresley - Was a protege of Ivatt , who became aware of his
      capabilities,  and  saw  great things coming from the young engineer.
      Having  had  experience  at  the  Lancashire & Yorkshire, following 5
      years  at  Crewe  and  3  years  at  Horwich,  Mr.  H.N.  Gresley had
      eventually  been  elevated  to  the  position  of  Carriage  &  Wagon
      Superintendent within the works of Doncaster in 1905.  Due in part to
      his   progressive   thinking,   Gresley  was  subsequently  appointed
      successor to Ivatt in 1911, which made him a C.M.E.  at the age of 35
      years!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His  first designs were 0-6-0's with 68" wheels which lent themselves
      towards  mixed traffic duties, culminating in the "A" series pacifics
      which  became  a  household  legend  within  their  own lifetime, and
      immortalised  in  railway history by "Mallard".  The only drawback to
      his  three  cylindered locos was that the linkage to the centre valve
      gear  was  prone  to failure.  Like all streamliners, the A4's had to
      lose  part  of  their  dressing,  but  due  to  the  very  nature  of
      construction,  the  loss  was  minimal, and they retained their sleek
      appearance.</P>

  <P>             . 
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir  William  Stannier  -  Originally  of Great Western, produced the
      "Princess" and later the "Duchess" class locos used for heavy express
      duties on the L.M.S.  routes.  The G.W.R.  heritage of these machines
      was  evident  by  the  positioning of the cylinders and the design of
      cross-heads  and  guides.   Various  Black  Fives  bore  the Stannier
      boiler,  and  the same was later employed on the Jubilee class, which
      uprated their power output considerably.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Duchess  started life as a somewhat ugly streamliner, in keeping
      with  the  L.N.E.R.   practice to mark the royal coronation, but this
      was  removed  at the outbreak of WW2 to faciliate easier maintenance.
      This produced a classic outline, which we know today.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O.V.Bullied  -  Produced some of the most unusual and radical designs
      ever  seen  on the British railway network.  His pacifics possessed a
      chain-driven  valve  gear  running in an oil bath, which was prone to
      major  failure  (  also  raising the habit of engines catching fire).
      Other features were Boxpoc wheels which were not spoked but cast, and
      a  squared  air  smoothing  lending  itself  toward  a  modern diesel
      appearance.   His  strangest  design  must have surely been the 0-6-0
      tendered  "Q1",  which  without  running  boards and a square section
      boiler with inside valve gear gave them a skeletal look.  Even though
      he'd  spent some years under Sir Nigel Gresley, this had no effect on
      a  radical  designer,  a man of learning, charm and integrity with an
      extremely  keen  and original mind.  The pacifics eventually lost the
      streamlining  and  troublesome  valve  gear  and  went on to be quite
      remarkable machines right up to the end of steam operation on B.R.</P>

<P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Churchward  &  Collett - Great Western engineers, and traditionalists
      at  that.  The designs from these two men came in all manner of shape
      and  size,  but with one thing in common - copper capped chimneys and
      brass  steam  domes ( reminiscent of their predecessor, Daniel Gooch.
      This  was  a  hall  mark  of  the  Swindon works, the last loco to be
      adorned  this  way  was  922220 Evening Star.  Though being a Riddles
      design,  it  was  built  at Swindon, and emerged in express passenger
      green  with "all the trimmings".  This was the only one of it's class
      so  presented.   The G.W.R.  employees held a tangible pride in their
      jobs;  anything  which  could  be  polished  was, and stations were a
      delight to see.  The accompanying photo shows why Great Western locos
      are still a strong preference with photographers.</P>

<P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Not everything concerning the railways was serious.  It also has it's
      lighter moments, as I've included below!</P>

<CENTER> Dead Sheep (from Tony Wood,  courtesy of the Watercress Line).</CENTER> 
<P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some  years  ago,  a  loco  crew  came upon a dead sheep on the line.
      Fearing  it  may  have been hit by a previous train, they got down to
      investigate, and found the unfortunate animal stiff with rigor mortis
      (and thus having been dead for some time).  Accordingly, they did the
      obvious  thing:   took  it  back to the field and left it standing up
      with one leg supported by a stone.</P>

<CENTER>One can't help but wonder what the farmer thought about this !</CENTER>
<P>

      <CENTER>Tractive Effort (from the author).</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The controls of a steam loco are like those of a sports car - tell it
      to  go,  and it will.  This was proven by a young man trying his hand
      at  the  regulator  of a 2-10-0 Ruddles 9F, whose enthusiasm with the
      regulator  ended  in  a  spectacular  fireworks  display  and a close
      inspection of the coal in the tender for all on the footplate, with a
      panicky dive for the regulator as the 9F went into full gallop from a
      standing start!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well,  I  think  that's  all  for  this  outing.  Next time, it'll be
      signalling,  a  guide of where to take the kids ( and the bigger ones
      ),  and  a  chance  to  have  a  few  of  those  questions  answered.
      Hopefully, I've wet your appetites for something different to do with
      the  family during those long holidays, if only to beat the boredom !
      If space permits, perhaps something on rolling stock, and a flashback
      item.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Bye!</P>
