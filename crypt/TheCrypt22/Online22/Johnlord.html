<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  name is John Lord,  and I live in a town called Gravesend,  in
      Kent,  UK.  I was born in 1947,  so I'll leave you to work out  my
      current age.<font color=yellow> :))</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  have  been  married,  and have a son Richard who  was  born  in
      Gravesend Hospital in 1979,and a daughter Hazel who  was  born  in
      Lewisham  Hospital in 1975.        I live on my own with  a  large
      selection of plants,  mostly cacti.  And often get told off when I
      say,   "I think I might buy that plant".  The answer being,   "You
      aint got the space Dad!",  but I usually find somewhere to put  it
    <font color=yellow>  :)</font></P><font color=yellow>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  taste  in music is very varied,  I like rock through  to  folk
      style,  electronic music to some classical,  old to modern. So you
      could find CDs by Queen,  Pink Floyd, ELO, Dire Straits, Vangelis,
      Mariah  Carey,   Beautiful   South,    Mark  Knofler,   Fairground
      Attraction, Simply Red, and many others.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  sort  of  programs  I  like on tv are Travel  &  Exploration,
      Science & Sci-Fi,  virtually any kind of motor sport,  both 2 &  4
      wheels,  power boat racing.  And other things that catch  my  eye,
      like historical documentaries or costume drama.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animals,  now I like most kinds of animals,  I get a great deal of
      pleasure  being  'hands  on' with them.   For  example  the  usual
      feelings when you play with,  or stroke a cat or dog.  I have been
      very  lucky to go and stay on a farm in Northumberland where  they
      have horses,  sheep,  goats and of course the usual compliment  of
      working border collies and other breeds,  and also many cats.  And
      the  pleasure  from working with the horses,  especially  the  new
      foals is something that I will always remember.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> To  be  accepted  and trusted by an animal is a very  warming  and
      humbling  experience.  And I totally abhor  any  cruelty  directed
      towards them.</P>


                                 <font color=red><CENTER> Amigas & I</CENTER>
<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first Amiga was the good old A500.  It came with only 512K chip
      mem of course,  and had the 1.3 version of Workbench. It came with
      Shadow of The Beast II,  Days of Thunder,  and another game that I
      can't remember the name of at the moment.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After  a  while I upgraded it with an additional 1/2 meg  of  fast
      mem  for about £60,  I think it was,  then later on made it a 2Meg
      machine, (wow, ...massive) ..<font color=yellow> :))</font></P><font color=yellow> 

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">I  kept  this  one for a couple of years,  adding an extra  floppy
      drive to it, but not much else.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">But  after the A1200 had been around for about a year,  I  started
      to  get a little tired of the A500,  you see,  it didn't help when
      my mate came round on one of his weekly visits,  and showed me  an
      A1200 he had bought. So I started looking around for one too.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">I  eventually found one for sale,  and had the chance  to  buy  an
      8Meg  ram  card  (populated)  with it at the same  time.   I  part
      exchanged my A500 for it, and didn't I notice the difference.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> After  the  speed of the old machine this new one seemed lightning
      fast, (especially with the extra fast ram).</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  this machine became the base of what I use today,  I now have
      a  tower  bought  from a local supplier but not  now  advertising.
      Inside on the motherboard,  which is not the original,  because  I
      once  plugged something in to the wrong place and ended up sending
      smoke signals to the neighbours.  But it has all the fixes done to
      it so it should be ok. The add-ons are as follows,</P>
