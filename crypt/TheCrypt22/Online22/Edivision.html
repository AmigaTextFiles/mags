<font color=white><CENTER>by Courtesy of Obligement </CENTER>
<P>



 <font color=white>     1) <font color=yellow>Could  you  introduce  yourself,  and  the  two other founders of
      Edivision (name, age and most famous achievement)?
<P>
<font color=red>      PR: <font color=aqua>  My  name  is  Patrick  Roberts  and  I'm  33.   My  most famous
      achievement  is  surviving  making  Disney's  Dinosaur, were I was an
      effects supervisor.
<P>
 <font color=yellow>      SH: <font color=aqua>  Steven Haun, 35 and my most famous achievement is being able to
      survive Hollywood so far.
<P>
<font color=green>      JE:<font color=aqua>   Jeremy Engleman, 29 and I suppose that would have to be working
      on Riven:  The Sequel to Myst.
<P>
   <font color=white>   2) <font color=purple> How  did  you  discovered  Amiga  computer  and why are you still
      interested in Amiga Community ?


<P>

  <font color=red>    PR: <font color=aqua>  The  first  Amiga  I had was a 500 (couldn't afford a 1000 so I
      just had to drool over friends').  It was the natural progression for
      me  as  before  I  had  a C64, Vic20, and (at work) a PET.  The Amiga
      community  created  software far ahead of its time.  Even now many of
      the  best  applications and games on other platforms come from former
      Amiga  developers.  I like the Amiga community because the people who
      make  it  up were able to recognized and chose the superiority of the
      Amiga  platform  compared  to  competitors  who had better marketing.
      That  spirit  still exists today in the community...  we all know how
      messed up mainstream computing is now and know it could be better.
<P>
  <font color=green>    JE:<font color=aqua>  A 500 as well.  Amigas were certainly ahead of their time.
<P>
 <font color=white>     3) <font color=purple> Are  you  still  using  an  Amiga, and in this case, what is your
      current configuration ?
<P>
    <font color=red>  PR:<font color=aqua>   Due  to  space  limitations  I  had  to loan my last Amiga to a
      friend.  It was an A3000/040-25/CyberGFX.
<P>
 <font color=green>     JE:<font color=aqua>  I still have a 1200 actually, but do not use it at all-more of a
      museum piece really.

<P>

<font color=white>      4)<font color=purple>  Where does the name Edivision come from ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua>  Edivision is a parent LLC for our development labels, the first
      of which is called "Lower Mars"
<P>
<font color=white>      5) <font color=purple> Why did you settled on founding Edivision ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR:<font color=aqua>   We  had  been  negotiating with some console publishers and got
      tired  of  the  politics  so  we decided to create a company we could
      control ourselves.
<P>
 <font color=yellow>      SH:<font color=aqua>  We knew we wanted to create a software company.  We were looking
      into  console games.  Though when we got the opportunity to jump into
      something new, like the Amiga DE, we couldn't resist.
<P>
 <font color=white>     6)<font color=purple>  How  many  people  are  currently working at Edivision (full time
      or/and contractors) ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua>  There  are  currently  only 3 of us part-time.  (We all have to
      keep  our  day  jobs until the DE makes us millionaires :P ) Although
      many  (long)  weeks  we all put in more time after-hours on Edivision
      projects than we do at our current day jobs.
<P>
<font color=white>      7) <font color=purple> Where are you located ?
<P>
  <font color=red>    PR: <font color=aqua>  Studio  City,  CA.  (Part of Los Angeles County/the greater Los
      Angeles area.)
<P>
  <font color=white>    8) <font color=purple> Could you describe the "atmosphere" at Edivision ?
<P>
  <font color=red>    PR:<font color=aqua>  Virtual :P ( We don't have offices yet.).
<P>
 <font color=yellow>     SH:<font color=aqua>  Curious.  We wait to see what will happen in the AmigaDE world.
<P>
<font color=green>      JE:<font color=aqua>   Hopeful.   That  the  platforms  can support and facilitate the
      kinds of things we would like to do.
<P>
 <font color=white>     9)<font color=purple>  You were planning to create 3 development labels.  Could you talk
      about those labels ?  What is currently developed for each ones ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR:<font color=aqua>  We still plan to create 3 labels.  As we grow and bring on staff
      it  will  help  organize  development.  "Jackpot!" is being developed
      under  "Lower  Mars"  which will primarily create first-rate original
      entertainment  titles.  We have a utility label which will come next-
      that  project  is  currently  in  R&D  phases  and  looks  to be very
      exciting.   Finally  we  will  put any games we license under a third
      label.

<P>
 <font color=white>     10)<font color=purple>  Could  you  talk  especially  about  the  slot game you released
      screenshots few weeks ago on amiga.org ?
<P>
<font color=red>      PR: <font color=aqua>  Jackpot!   is  our  first  title.   It's  a  electronic  casino
      simulator  featuring  slot  machines,  video  cards, and video slots.
      There  will  be  a total of 10 different games in the virtual casino.
      We  have  some  really really fun game designs and Jeremy has created
      fantastic graphics for the machines.  Our design goal was to create a
      casino   game   that  would  be  entertaining  for  both  gamers  and
      non-gamers,  and  I think we've done a good job to that end.  Virtual
      casinos  are  among the most popular titles on PDAs and we think ours
      will be better than any of current crop.
<P>
 <font color=white>     11) <font color=purple> When will we see first Edivision products ?
<P>
 <font color=yellow>      SH: <font color=aqua>  We  have to wait until AmigaDE PDA hardware is available to the
      public,  which  should  be Q1/Q2 2002.  Jackpot!  will be released at
      roughly the same time.
<P>
   <font color=white>   12)<font color=purple>  Are you currently looking for game developers ?



<P>
 <font color=red>     PR:<font color=aqua>   Not  right  now.  We are currently negotiating with a couple of
      companies to license titles.  When that happens we will start outside
      staffing.   At  some  point  in the future we also want to be able to
      serve as an incubator for garage developers.
<P>
<font color=white>      14)<font color=purple>  What are the kind of games suited for PDA market, which seems to
      be really peculiar ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua>  PDA  owners  buy games that are commonly familiar (don't need a
      lot of instructions) and can be played in short spurts.  Current golf
      and casino titles are among the most popular for these reasons.
<P>
 <font color=white>     13)<font color=purple>  What is your foresight for the development of the PDA market ?
<P>
<font color=red>      PR: <font color=aqua>  As  the  machines become more powerful and cheaper I think they
      will be what Gameboy fans move up to when they get older.
<P>
<font color=white>      15) <font color=purple> What do you think about other development platform, for instance
      Linux on SL-5000 ?



<P>
<font color=red>      PR: <font color=aqua>  As  opposed  to  the  Amiga DE, they lock you in to a platform.
      With  the DE we can create a title that will run on not only the most
      popular  current  platforms,  but  also  any  capable platform in the
      future.  This gives us a tremendous market advantage over competitors
      who  would need to port their titles for new platforms.  The Amiga DE
      is also much less expensive than most commercial middleware licenses,
      which  provide  only some of the cross-platform benefits of the Amiga
      DE.
<P>
 <font color=white>     16) <font color=purple> Are you planning to advertise for your products in a near future
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua>  Yes.   We will be marketing Jackpot!  when Sharp releases their
      PDA.
<P>
 <font color=white>     17) <font color=purple> Are  you  planning  to release games adapted for other platforms
      that PDA?
<P>
<font color=red>      PR: <font color=aqua>  Possibly in the future, but for now we're just concentrating on
      PDA titles.
<P>
 <font color=white>     18) <font color=purple> Could you talk about your co-operation with Amiga Inc. ?


<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua> Amiga has been great providing us with support.  As for our part
      back,  we'll  be giving Amiga license to distribute many of the tools
      and  libraries  we  create  as  open-source  and  free for commercial
      development.  We also look to grow this relationship even more in the
      future.
<P>
 <font color=white>     19) <font color=purple> "Three  people from Disney" made some concept design of hardware
      for Amiga Inc., some months ago.  Are you those people ?
<P>
 <font color=red>     PR: <font color=aqua>  I was one of them.  Michael Daugherty and Archie Agote were the
      other two.
<P>
<font color=white>      21) <font color=purple> Do  you  have interest in other Amiga related project (AmigaOne,
      OS4, and also MorphOS/Pegasos) ?
<P>
 <font color=yellow>      SH:<font color=aqua>   Due  to  limited  resources,  right  now  we're focused just on
      AmigaDE  and  even  only AmigaDE PDA.  In the future if resources are
      available and it makes financial sense we would.

 <font color=white>     22)<font color=purple>  A message for our readers ?
<P>
<font color=yellow>      SH:<font color=aqua> Stayed tuned!
