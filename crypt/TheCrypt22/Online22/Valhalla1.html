      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pick  up the door key, operate the floor tile in the bottom left hand
      corner  of  the room, pick up the map.  Come out of the room and take
      the  first left, pick up the gold coin.  Go back to the main corridor
      and walk down the wide but narrow room, pick up the silver key from a
      stool,  and  the Talisman of Light from the altar.  Walk up and right
      again, the first door you come to on your left can be opened with the
      first key you found.  Inside take another gold door key.  Come out of
      the room and back the way you came, find the door that is opened with
      the  key you have just found.  In this room operate the floor tile in
      the  bottom  right,  pick  up the map that was beneath it.  Leave the
      room  and turn right, pull the lever which opens the door next to it.
      The room beyond this door is trapped so watch your step, you now have
      the  map but the floor is marked so you may not need it.  Pick up the
      small  chest key, (this fits a chest in another room where a withered
      rose  is  hiding) the grey crystal and at the bottom right right hand
      corner of the room is a lever you should pull.  Leave this room, walk
      up  and  turn right and go in the room you have opened by pulling the
      lever.   Put  the gold coin in the wishing well and take the red gem.
      Take  the stick and operate the floor tile that it was lying on, this
      reveals  a  ring belonging to the Princes father.  Take it and travel
      back  to  the  room  where  you began the level.  Put the ring on the
      identity  stone,  it is exchanged for your birthright which should be
      placed  on  the altar of justice.  This is in the other trapped room.
      You  should  now  have the scales of justice in your possesion.  Give
      these  to the skull that asks "What is your Quest?" He will allow you
      passage  into  another room.  In here there are two crowns, leave the
      jewelled  crown  where  it  is  or you will come a cropper.  Take the
      other  crown instead.  Pick up the strength potion and the chest key,
      then  pull  the  lever.   In  the  next room, drop the red gem on the
      portcullis  that  came  up behind you to remove it.  Leave the poison
      but  pick  up  the plank.  Put the withered rose in the water of life
      and take the fresh rose.  Go back to the trapped room where you found
      the grey crystal and open the chest.  Take cold protection potion and
      another chest key.  Find the door that is opened with the silver key,
      put  the  plank  across  the chasm to get to the chest, inside find a
      chalice  and  a gem.  Travel to the room where the skull is that says
      "Do  You Love Me?" Give him the rose and he opens a door.  Ignore the
      first  portcullis  that  appears  behind you and continue through the
      corridor,  pull  the  lever to open the door.  Inside is the gaurdian
      with  blue eyes, pull the lever, take the gold symbol, then leave the
      room and turn left.  Another portcullis appears in front of you, drop
      the  gem  onto it to get past.  Travel through the door you opened by
      pulling the lever and head back into the room where the skull is that
      asks  "Do  You  Love Me?  Put the crown on Meredith's throne and take
      the  warriors  shield  that  appears in it's place.  Fill the chalice
      with  water  from  the  tap  in  the  same room, then go and find the
      miracle stone.  Put the chalice full of water on the miracle stone to
      turn  it  to wine, present this to the relevant skull who rewards you
      with  a  rubber  soles potion.  Travel to the boulder that has so far
      blocked  your  passage  and  drink  the  strength potion, pick up the
      boulder and put it down were the hole it creates doesn't trap you for
      eternity.   When  the  strength  potion has run out, drink the rubber
      sole  potion.   The  corridor  beyond  is  filled  with  the warriors
      electrocution  devices,  the  rubber sole potion will protect you but
      time  is  short.   When you reach the end of the corridor, insert the
      stick  in the hole in the wall to make a lever which you have to pull
      to  open  the  door  below.   Take  the  warriors  sword then put the
      warriors  shield on the warriors tomb to disarm the passageway.  Pull
      the  lever  which  opens the door opposite.  Before entering the room
      make  sure  you have found the gem in the U bend of the passageway so
      you can disarm the portcullis.  In this room place the gold symbol on
      the  engraved  altar  then  travel  back the way you came and put the
      warriors  sword  on  the  bloodstone, this action covers the sword in
      blood  and  is the perfect gift for the skull who asks you for blood,
      he  opens  the  door to the next room.  Inside here find the gaurdian
      with  the  red eyes.  Take the chest key.  Open the relevant chest in
      which  you find the a door key and an unlit candle, the key opens the
      door  at  the end of the now disarmed passageway.  Inside four skulls
      all  ask  you  for the talisman of light, give it to the skull in the
      bottom left of the room and he allows you passage into the next room,
      all  the  others will send you screaming to your death.  Next door is
      the  gaurdian  with the green eyes, put the grey crystal on the stone
      of  two colors which turns it into a yellow crystal.  Take the credit
      card off the floor and hurry back to the room where the warriors tomb
      is located.  Insert the credit card in the electrical machine to open
      yet  another  door.   In  here, take the chest key and place the cold
      protection  potion  onto  the  altar decorated with a black and white
      circle take the fire protection potion that appears in it's place and
      take  the  rock  off the stool.  Drink the potion and take the eye of
      the beholder from the hot coals in the room opposite.  Put the eye in
      the  water  of  beauty  and  take  the  green crystal.  Return to the
      gaurdian  with  the green eyes, face it and insert the green crystal.
      You  can  now  take the first of the four orbs which you place on the
      relevant  altar  in  the  large room where the four altars are found.
      Your chest key fits the chest in the first trapped room, take the jug
      of  infinity and the piece of coal, travel down to the second trapped
      room  and  put the coal on the crystal flame, take the black crystal.
      Fill  the  jug  of infinity with water from the tap, then travel back
      down  the passageway to the room where the warriors tomb is situated.
      Insert  the  black crystal in the gaurdian.  You now have access to a
      small  room, pull the lever which opens the door across the chasm and
      put  the  unlit  candle  on the fire stone to light it.  The skull in
      here asks you for the password.  Pick up the lit candle and return to
      the chasm room.  Put the lit candle opposite the other candle and the
      chest  opens.   Take  the  red  crystal,  insert this in the relevant
      gaurdian  to  glean the second orb.  Cross the chasm and don't forget
      to  pick  up the plank as inside the next room another chasm opens up
      behind  you.   Take the second gold symbol and a gem.  Put the symbol
      on the second engraved altar in the room where the eye was and a door
      opens  into a room where the infinity stone is found.  Put the jug of
      infinity  on  here  and  take the gem of infinity.  Operate the floor
      tile  in  the  top right hand corner of the room and take the dagger.
      Go  and find the skull that asked you for the password, face him then
      look at the gem of infinity.  He allows you to enter a room where you
      find  a  stick and an altar with world war engraved onto it.  Put the
      dagger  on here and take the poppy.  Give this to the skull that asks
      for  rememberance,  he  rewards you with a parchment, this is full of
      clues to help you, so read it well.  Put the stick in the hole in the
      room  where  you  found the eye and operate it.  This opens the other
      door  behind which is very little apart from a stool.  Place the rock
      on  here  to  gain  access to the room where the gaurdian with yellow
      eyes  is  lurking.  Insert the yellow crystal and take the third orb.
      Put  the  parchment  on  the  altar  of  sadness  which  is  near the
      bloodstone and take the tears of loyalty, place these in the water of
      hope  in  the second trapped room and take the blue crystal.  Go find
      the gaurdian with the blue eyes and grab his orb.  You have found all
      four   orbs  and  if  you  haven't  allready,  place  them  on  their
      appropriate  altars,  the  portcullis  in  front of the last gaurdian
      descends  so  you  can  insert the gem of infinity, your last task in
      level one.</P>
