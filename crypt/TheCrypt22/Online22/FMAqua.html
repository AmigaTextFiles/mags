     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Kelly  Samel from the Canadian company who developed AQUA had this to
      say  "Emerald  Imaging  is  pleased to be working with FORE-MATT Home
      Computing  in  the  world-wide  distribution  of  Aqua.  Working with
      FORE-MATT will ensure that Aqua is available world-wide for all Amiga

      dealers,  including  FORE-MATT  Home  Computing and directly from our
      website.   It's  all  about  opening  up  choice and offering quality
      software and service to Amiga customers and dealers.  We feel we will
      succeed  in  this  goal  thanks  to  Aqua  gaining  a  wide  scope of
      availability and appeal."</P>
