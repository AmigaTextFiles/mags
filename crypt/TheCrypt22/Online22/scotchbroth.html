                <font color=aqua><CENTER>This is surely one of the worlds greatest soups!</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inter-change  the vegetables and meat at will but do not leave barley
      off  your  list  of  ingredients.   Scotch Broth has been called "the
      porridge  of  the  evening"  in  so  far  as  saying  that it is good
      rib-sticking stuff that can be a great meal on its own.</P>

                                  <CENTER> <B>Ingredients</B></CENTER>
<P>
        <CENTER>¼lb. pearl barley</CENTER>
       <CENTER> ¼lb. dried pies</CENTER>
<CENTER>½lb. mutton or braising beef steak</CENTER>
        <CENTER>water</CENTER>
        <CENTER>2 tablespoons salt</CENTER>
       <CENTER> 3 leeks</CENTER>
        <CENTER>3 carrots</CENTER>
       <CENTER> 1 turnip (swede)</CENTER>
       <CENTER> 1 small white cabbage or 5-6 leaves of kale</CENTER>
<CENTER>1 onion</CENTER>
       <CENTER> 1oz. parsley</CENTER>
       <CENTER> A little black pepper</CENTER>
<P>
                                   <CENTER><B>Directions</B></CENTER>
<P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Before  going  to  bed  soak  the barley and dried peas in water.  It
      doesnt  really  matter  what  the  temperature  of the water is but I
      prefer to set the barley and peas going in boiling water.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  next day place the beef in a saucepan, cover with cold water add
      the  salt  and  bring  to the boil.  Simmer gently for about an hour.
      Whilst  the meat is cooking chop up the carrots and turnip into small
      cubes.  Also chop the onion, leeks and cabbage (or kale) finely.  Add
      the soaked barley and peas to the boiling mutton or beef and then add
      the prepared vegetables and allow the mixture to simmer for a further
      hour.   If  the  level  of  the  liquid should fall too low add extra
      boiling water.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Fifteen  minutes  before  the  end of the second hour add the chopped
      fresh parsley together with a little freshly ground black pepper.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  broth  can  be  served straight away but tastes even better upon
      re-heating  the  next  day  so  never make small quantities of Scotch
      Broth,  always  plan  on  two  days  worth.   It is said that in some
      households  the  broth  pot  is constantly on the stove and is merely
      added to as required.  Personally I prefer my broth during the winter
      months only but that is perhaps just a modern taste.</P>
