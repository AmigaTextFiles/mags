                <font color=purple><CENTER>A Big welcome to this ..Our first Issue of 2002.</CENTER>
<P>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  we  hit  the New Year (02) Loads of changes started taking place,
      not  just  within  the <font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua> ..But also in<font color=lime> RIYAN Productions <font color=aqua> and the
      Amiga Scene.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua><font color=lime><font color=aqua>

                              <font color=green><H1> <CENTER>RIYAN Productions:</CENTER></H1>

       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">As  we  saw  in  the New Year ..  We were hit by two of our long term
      Members deciding to call it a day or move on to greener pastures.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes  sadly  we  have lost the services of both Craig Daines and Steve
      Hyde.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Steve  Hyde (Staff Writer).  Was a Member of the original CRYPT Team,
      and  had  his own unique style of writing.  Steve was also one of the
      first  to  come  back  when  Ray  and I decided to re-issue the<font color=red> CRYPT
      Magazine.</font></P><font color=red>


      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Steve  has been a close friend of mine for a number of years, keeping
      in  contact  both  by  letter and telephone (Something that certainly
      brightened up my days<font color=white>:)</font></P><font color=white>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Unknown  to  a lot of people, Steve, sadly lost his wife in 2001.  He
      decided at that time to continue with his work at the<font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua>, however,
      as  time progressed Steve is trying to rebuild his personal life, and
      in doing so is finding less and less time for computer work.</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Steve mate!  You will be sadly missed by all the Team Members, but we
      respect your wishes and hope you will find happiness.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Craig  Daines  (Technical Editor).  Another original<font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua> Member who
      returned  upon  our  re-issue.   Craig  is  one  person  with  superb
      knowledge  of  all  things  Amiga.   Sadly in January this year Craig
      informed  us  that  due  to the inactivity in the Amiga Scene, he was
      finding  it  harder and harder to find things to write about, and had
      decided  to  leave  the  post of Technical Editor and move on to Beta
      testing that wonderful Amiga game DYMamite.</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Our  heartfelt  thanks  to these two good friends and our best wishes
      for the future.</P>



     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Now most hobbyist type magazines would crumble at the loss of two Key
      Members.  In fact I have seen Magazines close for a lot less, but not
      so  the <font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua>.   We have a wealth of talent not only within our team
      but also in our readership.</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> At  this  point,  Ray  and  I  decided  not  just  to fill the vacant
      positions but to take the opportunity for a slight re-organisation of
      <font color=lime>RIYAN Productions.</font></P><font color=lime>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Technical  Editor (Amiga):- This post has been filled by Francis Loch
      one  of  our former Staff Writers.  Francis has a fantastic knowledge
      of the Amiga and is also a skilled programmer.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Technical  Editor  (PC)  :- This NEW Post has been taken by Ian Urie,
      Ian  was  of  course  one  of  our Staff Writers, And has a wealth of
      knowledge not only of the PC but also of the Amiga.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff  Writer  :- Bruce Steers.  Bruce is well known in Amiga circles
      and  has  written  several excellent programs.  I am sure we will see
      some excellent material from him in issues to come.</P>



      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff Writer :- Kathy Danby.  Kathy is another Amiga enthusiast, that
      is  well  known  ...Originally  from  Manchester, but now residing in
      Orkney.   Even in this issue Kathy has added her own blend of writing
      skills to produce some excellent articles for us.</P>


                              <font color=red><H1><CENTER> The CRYPT Magazine</CENTER></H1>

                       <font color=white><CENTER>Yep! Changes afoot here as well :)</CENTER><P>

       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firstly  you  will  notice  that  the <font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua> now has a larger content
      relating to the PC format.  We offer no apology for this.  Many Amiga
      supporters  now own a PC, either running under Amiga emulation or (As
      I do) have both platforms (PC and Amiga).</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you  are  an Amiga owner ..And you are considering upgrading your
      machine  to  a  PC  ...   Hoping to run Amiga emulation, or even just
      replace  your  existing  Amiga, Then we at the CRYPT can give you all
      the help and advice you need.</P>

                       <font color=red><H1><CENTER> The CRYPT (DMC Amiga only version)</CENTER></H1>

      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly after many years of faithful service, we have decided that this
      will  be  the Last issue of the<font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua> to appear using the DMC package
      (Disk Magazine Creator)</font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This  decision  was  taken  for several reasons:  For an example this
      issue is huge ..7 floppy disks.  This has increased our costs and the
      costs  of  those  readers  not  on  line.  The postage alone for this
      amount  of  disks  is crippling and it is just not viable to continue
      distributing the magazine in this format.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Another  reason  was  the  limitation of the DMC package.  Only using
      Pictures/Graphics  of  16  colours  was a massive drawback.  The fact
      that  DMC has difficulty with expanded Amigas or OS 3.9, and the time
      taken to develop 3 different versions of the Magazine, all meant that
      something had to give.</P>





                            <font color=purple><H1> <CENTER>So what for the Future?</CENTER></H1><P>

       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The <font color=red> CRYPT  <font color=aqua> will  still  be available as a FREE Download from our Web
      Site  ..   As a "Zip" file, This allows Amiga or PC users to download
      our  HTML  version  and read it off line via there preferred browser.
      For  those  readers  NOT  online.   The<font color=red> CRYPT <font color=aqua> will still be sent out,
      however  now  it  will  be  on a CD-ROM and will be the HTML version.
      Again easily read via an Amiga/PC browser.</font></font></font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua><font color=red><font color=aqua>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  this  means  is that as we are only producing one version of the
      magazine,  we  can  spend more time looking/writing bigger and better
      articles for YOU the readers.</P>



                                 <font color=red><H1><CENTER> THE CRYPT 22.</CENTER></H1><P>

       <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  current  issue  of the <font color=red>CRYPT <font color=aqua> contains several new features.  We
      have  a  large  readership  of ladies, so we have included a new page
      entitled <font color=red>CRYPT CUISINE.</font></font></font></P><font color=red><font color=aqua><font color=red>




                                 <font color=purple><CENTER>Valhalla Games.</CENTER><P>

      Vulcan  Software.   These  were the first ever speech adventure games

      and  required  to  run  the game) ...Then download the first level of
      Valhalla "Lord of Infinity", again completely FREE.</P>
