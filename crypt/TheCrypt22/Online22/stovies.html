     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  the  past when money and food were in short supply Scots know how
      to  make  the  most  of  their  meagre  resources, stovies are a good
      example  of  a  peasant  dish  that  combined any left-over meat with
      plenty  of  potatoes,  the  mainstay of the crofters diet in the last
      century.   Being  mainly  potato  it  provided  energy in the form of
      starch  and  bulk  to fill empty stomachs.  Despite the dishes "poor"
      origins  it  is very tasty, filling and often served with oatcakes at
      ceilidhs (country dances) and evening wedding receptions.</P>






     
                                 <CENTER> <B> Ingredients</B></CENTER>
<P>
      <CENTER>2  oz.   beef  dripping  (sunflower  oil  may  be substituted for the
      dripping)</CENTER>
      <CENTER>4 tablespoons of good gravy (water may be substituted)</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 2 medium onion, finely chopped </CENTER>
<CENTER> 2 lb. peeled and roughly sliced potatoes</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Left-over roast beef, chopped</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Parsley, chopped</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Salt & pepper</CENTER>
<P>

                                   <CENTER><B>Directions</B></CENTER>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Cook  the onions in the dripping until they are soft but do not brown
      them.   Add  the  potatoes to the onions and mix well.  Cover the pot
      and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so as to prevent
      sticking.   The  gravy, meat, salt and pepper should now be added and
      mixed  well.   Again  cover  the  pot  and cook slowly until the thin
      potatoes  are mushy and the thicker cut ones soft - an hour should be
      sufficient  (this  part  of  the cooking can be done in a large Pyrex
      dish  in the oven, which will give a delightfully browned and crunchy
      topping).   The  dish should be garnished with the parsley and served
      with oatcakes and a glass of milk.</P>
