     <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Let  me start off by wishing everybody in the Amiga community all the
      best in 2002!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  you know, on November 1, 2001 Hyperion Entertainment entered into
      a  license agreement with Amiga Inc.  to produce Amiga OS 4.0 for PPC
      based systems.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Since  my  presentation in Cologne at the Amiga 2001 show on November
      17-18,  very  substantial  progress  was made which I am now ready to
      share with you.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of you have expressed some misgivings about the lack of progress
      reports  on  OS  4.0  development  but  I  hope  I  can count on your
      understanding as all of us have been extremely busy, even through the
      holiday  season,  to  bring  you  what  is  unquestionably  the  most
      ambitious OS upgrade since Amiga OS 3.0.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now I know that many of you are sceptical because of the scope of the
      project and because similar promises were made in the past.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To those people I would like to point out that Hyperion Entertainment
      does not enter into contracts lightly and that we have a track-record
      carrying  out  commercial  development and contract-work for Windows,
      Mac, Linux, Amiga and Amiga DE/Elate.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We  have brought together a truly impressive development team of some
      25  people  building  on  the  OS 3.5 and 3.9 development team whilst
      adding several well-known and respected Amiga developers to the mix.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I'm  very  pleased  to  say that Dave Haynie has agreed to serve as a
      technical consultant.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You'll be hard-pressed to find a more experienced team for the job!</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The feature-set of OS 4.0 has now been finalised to a large extent.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can't guarantee that every single feature listed here will make it
      in  the  initial  release  of OS 4.0 but this the feature-set that we
      have contractually committed to delivering.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  will  also note that for the first time in many, many years very
      substantial work is being done on Intuition, one of the core elements
      of  the Amiga OS.  Having a PPC native version of Intuition available
      will make a very noticeable difference speed-wise.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  intend  for OS 4.0 to be disk-based or at least partly disk-based
      and  partly flashrom based even for current Amiga's.  More about that
      in a later update.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  also  intend  for OS 4.0 to be installed effortlessly from CD and
      from scratch without the need for an existing OS install.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we have taken on more work (Intuition etc.) and folded some of the
      functionality  originally  planned  for  OS  4.2  into  OS  4.0, this
      inevitably  means  the  original  February  release-date  might  slip
      somewhat  but  all  in  all  we  believe  that the end-result will be
      technologically more satisfying.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Come  end  of  January, I hope to have the biggest chunk of the legal
      work  for  OS  4.0  behind me which will allow me to provide you with
      more regular updates.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  know  full well that your patience has been sorely tested over the
      last  years  so I understand your impatience and even your scepticism
      but  I  can assure you that the Amiga OS is in good hands and that we
      will deliver.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In closing, I would like to invite everybody out there who (out of an
      understandable  frustration  with  the neglect of the Amiga OS by its
      respective  past owners) decided to take matters in his own hands, to
      work with us, rather than against us.</P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT">Exec Second Generation (Exec SG)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exec  is  the  kernel  of the AmigaOS and is currently written in 68K<BR>
      assembly.   Exec  is being re-written in C and new functionality will
      be  introduced  to allow the deployment of OS 4.x on any suitable PPC
      hardware.  The following features are planned:</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * Hardware abstraction layer</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * Virtual memory</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * New library interface</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * Resource tracking and management</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">* Optional memory protection</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * WarpOS backwards compatibility</P>



      <P ALIGN="LEFT">68K "Just in Time" emulation</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> PPC native TCP/IP stack</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  implemented as a single shared library</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  compatible  with the Amiga standard "bsdsocket" API, as defined by
         the AmiTCP product</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  *  enhanced  API  for  more  control  over  the  inner  workings  and
         configuration</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  built-in DHCP client (e.g. for cable modems)</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  Internet Superserver (inetd)</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  IP filtering and networking address translation</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  drivers  for  asynchronous  PPP  (dial-up networking) and PPP over
         Ethernet (for ADSL and cable modems)</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> * AmiSSL V2.0</P>



     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> PPC native filesystem (FFS2)</P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> FFS2  is  a  fully backwards compatible re-implementation in C of the
      Fast  File System.  It supports media > 4 GByte, and a new variant of
      the  file/directory  name  storage  format which allows for long file
      names (up to 108 characters).</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  Recovery and Salvage tools</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Comprehensive  suite of salvage and recovery tools including Salvage,
      Undelete,  Unformat,  Repair,  RDBSalv, ReOrg/Defrag, Check Integrity
      etc.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  PPC native RTG system</P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The PPC native RTG system (based on Picasso 96 V3) allows for the use
      of modern graphics cards on the Amiga.  Drivers for all current Zorro
      II/III  cards  as  well  as  drivers  for the Permedia 2/3, Voodoo 3,
      Matrox  G450/G550  and  ATI  Radeon  are  planned.  An arithmetically
      optimised PPC native version of layers.library is also planned.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Warp3D</P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> New  version  of  Warp3D,  the powerful yet low-level 3D API which is
      both  available  on  the  classic Amiga and intent/Amiga DE and which
      allows   developers  to  rapidly  migrate  3D  content  between  both
      platforms.   Drivers for Permedia 2/3, Voodoo 3, Matrox G450/G550 and
      ATI Radeon are planned.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> OpenGL 1.3 support (Mesa 4.0)</P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> OpenGL  is  a  cross-platform  (Mac,  Linux,  Windows,  AmigaDE etc.)
      high-level  3D API originally developed by Silicon Graphics.  Support
      for  OpenGL  1.3  will be provided by porting the open source project
      Mesa  (which  now  passes all SGI compliance tests) which will sit on
      top  of  Warp3D  so  that  graphics-card  functionality not currently
      offered by the OpenGL API may be supported nonetheless.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">  PPC native RTA system (AHI)</P>  
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Retargetable Audio System allows the use of plug-in soundcards (PCI
      or  Zorro II).  AHI by Martin Blom is currently the de facto standard
      on  the  Amiga  and a PPC native version will be offered with support
      for  a  wide  variety  of soundcards including but not limited to all
      current  Amiga soundcards and the Soundblaster 128 and Live (EMU10K1)
      cards.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> PPC native Intuition and Reaction</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reaction  is the BOOPSI based GUI system for the Amiga, introduced in
      OS  3.5  and  extended  in OS 3.9.  Moreover a new preferences system
      will allow the user to change more aspects of the GUI.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Other features:</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  Drag and Drop support</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> *  New "ghosted" look</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  *  Full-user control of Workbench palette</P>



      <P ALIGN="LEFT">SCSI drivers for SCRIPTS based SCSI controllers</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> WarpInput API (working title)</P>
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> WarpInput  is  an  API  for  multimedia  controller  devices (akin to
      DirectInput  on Windows) which allows a programmer to provide support
      through one API for a wide variety of input-devices such as keyboard,
      mouse,   joysticks  (analog  and  digital),  track-ball,  Playstation
      controller etc.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Minimal USB stack</P>
