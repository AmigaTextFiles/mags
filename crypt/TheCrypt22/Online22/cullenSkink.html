                       <font color=aqua><CENTER> (Finnan haddock and potato soup)</CENTER>
<P>
                                   <CENTER>Serves 4-6</CENTER>
<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cullen skink has its roots in Cullen, a small town on the Moray Firth
      Coast  and is traditionally made using Finnan haddock on the bone but
      a  boneless smoked haddock or other smoked white fish can be used but
      do  avoid  any  fish  that has been chemically smoked and then dyed a
      lurid yellow colour.</P>

                                  <CENTER> <B>Ingredients</B></CENTER>
<P>
      <CENTER>1.5 lb. peeled potatoes.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 1 onion, finely chopped.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> 2 pints water.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>1 lb. Finnan haddock or other smoked white fish.</CENTER>
    <CENTER>  Milk.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Salt and pepper</CENTER>
<P>



                                   <CENTER><B>Directions</B></CENTER>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put  the  potatoes  and  onion in a large pot with the water and cook
      until  the  potatoes are almost soft.  Lay the Finnan haddock on top,
      put  the  lid  on  the pot and cook for a further 5 minutes until the
      fish  is  just  cooked.   Remove  the  fish, skin, bone and flake the
      flesh.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partially  mash  the  potatoes and onions in the cooking liquor (some
      prefer a "lumpy" soup while others like a smoother base).  Return the
      flaked  fish to the pot, mix thoroughly and add enough milk to create
      the  desired  consistency,  either a thickish stew- soup or a thinner
      soup.  Season the Cullen Skink and serve with bread.</P>
