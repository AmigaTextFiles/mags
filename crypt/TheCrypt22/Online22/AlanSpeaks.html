      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First  of  all  thanks  to everyone for their patience.  We have been
      working  very  hard to get something demonstrably working rather than
      just  announcing  more  promises.   Ideally  on  Friday we would have
      announced  that the A1 was going to be at the show, but at that point
      the board was locked up in British customs.  We didnt pick it up from
      UPS's  Durham  depot  (120  miles  from the show) until 7:30 Saturday
      morning  and had no idea whether it had survived the journey from the
      other  side  of  the  world  until  we  configured it at the show and
      switched it on.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly,  Fleecy and I were plannning to sit down and make sure that
      we  issued a jointly acceptable, coordinated, news release on the A1.
      But he got snowed in, in Cumbria, so we can't now do that until later
      in  the week.  Expect a major web site update on both our and Amiga's
      sites next Monday.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  in  the  meantime  I'm going to repeat here some of the things I
      said  at Alt-Woa as some of the 'authoritative' postings on this list
      (& ann) have been off in the realms of fantasy and bear little if any
      relationship to what I actually said.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> But first a bit of of background.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  main feedback that has come out over the last year can, I think,
      be summarised as follows:</P>
      
      CPU speed concerns<BR>
      Memory speed concerns<BR>
      Provision of legacy peripherals (FDD/Serial/Parallel/kb/mouse)<BR>
      Provision of integrated peripherals<BR>
      AGP speed<BR>
      Will it run Linux?<BR>
      But I dont have/want/will never buy an A1200<BR>
      Will it fit in in an EZTower mk1-5/RBM/xyz tower?<BR>
      It costs too much (interesting this one as the price has never been
      announced) and, of course<BR>
      Where is it?<P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  October 2000 when we laid out the design for the A1, there was no
      commercially  available 'northbridge' chip (the interface between the
      CPU,  memory  and PCI bus) at the relatively small quantities that we
      needed  at  an  economic  price.   'Southbridge' chips were available
      (these  handle  the  system timing, interrupts etc and, traditionally
      also  embed  the  lower  speed  peripheral functions such as IDE, USB
      etc),  but clearly these do not come with a built in A1200-PCI bridge
      -  which  would  have to be built in custom logic.  It therefore made
      economic  sense  to build a custom southbridge chip - but without the
      integrated peripherals (these were available on separate chips at low
      cost  anyway)  which  incorporated the A1200-PCI bridge.  Things were
      going  nicely  until  May/June  .  .  .  .  and you know the rest, or
      most of it anyway.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the time OS4 development had been signed off in early November the
      world  had  moved  on.   Commercially available PPC northbridge chips
      were  available,  and  coupled  with off-the-shelf southbridge chips,
      were  able  to  deliver better price performance than the original A1
      custom  chip  design,  and (since the big boys had already been using
      them  successfully) without the risk of bugs intrinsically present in
      any  custom  logic  implementation.   This meant that the only custom
      logic function needed was the PCI to A1200 bridge.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alongside  this  many  people  had  expressed  a  wish only to have a
      stand-alone   A1   board,  without  the  need  (or  ability)  to  run
      hardware-hitting applications.  In addition Hyperion have been making
      better  than expected progress in decoupling the chipset dependancies
      in the OS with a result that it will cease to be reliant on the Amiga
      chipset  quite  soon  now.   (Of course hardware hitting applications
      will  still  to  a  greater or lesser degree need access to a genuine
      Amiga  chipset).   Given this, we thought it would be sensible to try
      to  provide  Amiga  chipset  availability as an a option, so that the
      main  A1  board  would  not  have to carry the cost of providing this
      connection  -  in  terms  of  PCB  and  component  real-estate and in
      requiring  a  custom tower to mount it in.  The upshot is that Escena
      has  come  up  with  a  solution which allows the bridge to the A1200
      chipset  to  be  made from a PCI card, via ribbon cable, to the A1200
      edge  connector.   The use of a ribbon cable also solves the 'will it
      work  in  an  xyz tower' problem, as there is (within limits) quite a
      wide range of A1 & A1200 relative board positioning that can be used.
      Theis A1200 bridge will be an additional cost item for those who need
      it.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So with Escena concentrating their efforts on the bridge card, and us
      deciding  to  use  off-the-shelf north and south bridge parts for the
      main board it made sense to subcontract the design and manufacture to
      experts  in  this  field, who, surprise, surprise, are far east based
      (hence  the  problem  with customs on Friday).  The board (currently)
      runs  an  open  firmware-compatible bios and runs PPC linux (which is
      how  we  know  that  the  hardware  works  properly  before  OS4.0 is
      released).</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  terms of timeframes the board is now ready to go into production,
      with  a lead time of 4-6 weeks.  However we will not press the button
      until  we  can  be sure that OS4 will be ready to run on the board in
      the  same  timeframe.  OS4 is scheduled to go into beta during March,
      and we will make A1 boards available to help with this process.  When
      we  get the thumbs up from Hyperion we will start production and they
      will be with your local dealer around 6 weeks later.</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  terms of specification the entry level board will run a 600MHz G3
      CPU  and  will  come with this soldered in place, thereby keeping the
      costs  as low as possible.  After the first production run we will be
      producing boards - obviously at a higher cost - with a cpu carrier so
      that  cpu's  can easily be interchanged to suit your speed and pocket
      requirements.   As G4's fall in price we may also offer a soldered in
      place  G4 cpu option as well.  What happens if you buy an entry level
      board  and  want  to upgrade it in a year or so's time?  Well exactly
      the  same  as when you bought a similarly priced accelerator a couple
      of  years  back and want to upgrade to a faster one.  You either sell
      it privately or trade it in to the dealer where you purchased it.  In
      fact  in  the PC market, depite all processors being socketed, hardly
      anyone  ever  changes  the  cpu to improve the computer - they nearly
      always  have  to  buy  a (at least) a new motherboard as well.  We're
      just being upfront about it!</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So lets revisit that feedback list again:</P>
      
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">CPU speed concerns   -- G3/G4 to their current clocking limits</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Memory  speed  concerns  --  133MHz  FSB (DDR doesn't help PPC's I am
      told)</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Provision  of  legacy peripherals (FDD/Serial/Parallel/kb/mouse) - On
      board</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Provision of integrated peripherals - 2xUSB (motherboard) + 2 more on
      headers; LAN; AC97; MC97; UDMA100</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> AGP speed - 2x (although this is still a red herring in my view)</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Will it run Linux?  - Yes</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">But I dont have/want/will never buy an A1200 - Fine by me</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Will  it fit in in an EZTower mk1-5/RBM/xyz tower?  - Yes (subject to
      xyz definition - not sure about wooden towers)</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It  costs  too much (interesting this one as the price has never been
      announced)  -  A1 including 600MHz G3 cpu at current component prices
      and  exchange rates GBP 350/USD500/Euro 600 excluding local taxes and
      shipping.   And  before  anyone  (who  probably has no notion of real
      manufacturing  and  development  costs)  pipes up that they can buy a
      xzzz  PC  motherboard  for  $2.49 from Walmart remember this is for a
      board  being  manufactured  in  the (very?) low thousands, not by the
      million.   (And  don't forget that a 240MHz 603 ppc blizzard with 060
      cost  around ukp550 ex tax when they were last available - those were
      the days ;-) )</P>
      
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Where  is  it?  - In my office running Turbo Linux at the moment.  In
      your dealer as soon as OS4 is ready.</P>
