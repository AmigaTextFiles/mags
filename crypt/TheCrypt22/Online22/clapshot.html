<P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peel  the  potatoes  and  swede.  Cut both into roughly the same size
      pieces.   Put  into a deep pan with the onions.  Add boiling water to
      cover  and  simmer gently until the ingredients are just soft.  Drain
      off the cooking liquor.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mash  everything thoroughly, adding chives and enough milk and butter
      to  make  a  light  consistency.   Season  well with salt and pepper.
      Serve with cheese as a meal, or with haggis.  Clapshot will accompany
      many stews or fried meats.</P></font></font>
