<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Convenience  Store  -  the corner
shop.  Everyone's got one, quite local
to  them, usually on the corner of the
road.    Always  there,  always  open,
except when you run out of milk at 2am
or  the  cat's  just come in and wants
feeding, then they're closed.  We take
them  for  granted, and then moan when
they   close   down  because  the  new
supermarket   that   opened   recently
that's  about  2 miles away, has taken
all  the custom, and they can't afford
to compete and stay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  not  easy to run a little corner
shop  - ask anyone who's tried it, and
they'll  tell  you  all  about  it.  I
know, I manage one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  shop opens from 7am until 10pm at
night,  every  day, seven days a week,
all  year  round.  There's no rest for
the  wicked  -  just that I'd like the
opportunity  to  be  wicked  once in a
while.  :-)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  hope  you  all  had  a  very  happy
Christmas and I wish you good luck and
happiness during this year.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Talking  of  Christmas  -  this season
starts  as  the school summer holidays
end.   The  little treasures return to
school,  and  almost  immediately, the
shops  fill  up with tinsel, cards and
presents   to  buy.   Christmas  trees
start  appearing and festive songs are
heard  as  early  as  the beginning of
October.  Not for us, though.  We like
to  retain  normality  for  as long as
possible,  and  it  comes as a welcome
break  for  customers who begin to get
Christmas  fatigue  by  November.  Our
Christmas   displays   start   at  the
beginning  of December, although we've
had  the  stock  since October, and by
the  end  of  that month, I've made my
Easter  Egg  order.   We  always  know
Christmas  week  has  arrived,  as the
Easter  Eggs  are delivered that week,
which  we  always  hold back until the
New   Year   is  over.   We  swap  the
Christmas   card   display   for   the
Valentine display!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Christmas  lunacy  period is now over,
thank goodness.  It may be madness for
the  customers,  as they grab the last
minute   items   they  have  forgotten
during  their  massive shopping sprees
at  the supermarkets, but it makes for
total craziness in a small store which
doesn't hold much in the way of stock.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Typical  items  which people forget to
buy  (and  I know it will include some
of you reading this), are as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tin  foil  - for cooking the turkey in
Cranberry  sauce  - for dolloping onto
your  plate Gravy - for disguising the
taste of undercooked/overcooked turkey
Stuffing  -  for filling the bits that
are  hollow  Crackers  -  the  pulling
variety,  for  the  table.   Custard -
either  powder  or ready-made, for the
pudding/trifle  Milk  -  to  make  the
custard  or  tea/coffee  Cream  -  for
desert</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you  forget  anything  next  year,
(which you won't, as the list is above
to    remind   you),   remember   your
convenience  store,  and come early on
Christmas  Eve  to  make  sure there's
something  left  to  buy!  We even had
someone  eager  to  buy  some  of  the
decorations   which  we  used  in  the
store!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not  forgetting  the  mad  clamour  on
Christmas  Day  for batteries, for the
toys    which   came   without   them,
cigarettes   to  calm  the  adults  on
Christmas  Day,  last minute Christmas
cards and presents for people you only
hear  of  at  that time and you forgot
all    about    them    until    their
card/present  was  opened.   We  had a
queue  already waiting when we arrived
to open the store!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then  there's  the  alcohol - and very
upset  people  who  can't get it.  The
average   person   has  no  idea  that
Christmas   Day   is   subject   to  a
different  rule  regarding the sale of
alcohol,  set by law.  Alcohol is only
allowed  to be sold between 12 and 3pm
on  Christmas  Day, this is one reason
why  you only find your local pub open
then;  it's  nothing  to  do  with the
landlord not wanting to open, and have
a  day off, it's down to the licencing
laws.   We have to fend off very irate
customers  who  want that bottle for a
present for someone they want to visit
before  lunch.   No  sale  -  not even
"under  the  counter"  stuff.  I'm not
very sure where they think we keep it!
There's no room under our counters for
anything else but videos.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  had a few laughs at the expense of
numerous  folk  who  came  dashing  in
during the four hours we were open for
gas  top-ups  and  electricity  cards.
Most  had  assumed  the other half had
bought  some  or that they had enough,
to  find that as the meal was cooking,
their utilities had stopped.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  even  had  a  few lucky people who
wanted  to  claim  their winnings from
the  lottery, only to be told that the
lottery  terminal was closed.  Lottery
employees  were entitled to have a day
off too!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boxing  Day  was also busy, but we had
expected that.  What customers weren't
expecting  was  that  there  was  very
little  left  to  buy!   We  had  been
restricted  to  one delivery per week,
due  to transportation, and as fast as
we   had  stocked  the  shelves,  they
emptied.   We  managed  to restock and
then  New Year hit us, and exactly the
same happened.  It has taken two weeks
to restock to pre-blitz levels!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But,  as  usual,  the  winter  holiday
season   has   left   us   with  staff
shortages.   Our  little  shop  is now
manned  by  only 7 staff, and we begin
the  hunt  for new members, whilst the
staff  left  work like trojans keeping
the store open.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  is  not  the  time  for  finding
reliable staff either.  Most who apply
are suffering from empty coffers after
Christmas,  and  will  only stay until
they have cash in their pockets again,
which  could, if you are not sharp, be
at  your  own  expense, not just mine.
The  quickest  way  to re-fill pockets
for    some,   will   be   to   either
short-change  the customer, or to take
money  from the till, which is usually
not discovered until they finish their
shift, never to return again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For   those   who  read  the  previous
edition,  and  wondered  - yes, we did
sell   all   of   the  sherry  damaged
chocolates, and we didn't lose or make
any  extra  money on them either!  One
of  the assistants found them all in a
box  in  the  warehouse, and as we had
run  out  of  boxes  of  chocolates on
Christmas  Eve,  put  them  out on the
shelves.   In two hours, all had gone,
which  was  a  bonus  and  came  as  a
pleasant surprise to me, especially as
the  previous  evening  had  seen  the
disastrous  theft  of  six  bottles of
champagne  and  boxes of chocolates to
accompany them!  Shoplifters have gift
lists as well!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Watching  shoplifters in action can be
both  amazing  and  funny, except when
you  have  to  count the cost of their
antics.  To show you what I mean, take
these incidents for an example.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two teenagers came in with a large bag
between  them  and  tucked  themselves
down  the  household  aisle, whereupon
they  started  filling  the  bag  with
boxes  of  washing  powder.  They then
struggled  to  pick  up  the  bag  and
nonchalantly  walk  out  of  the store
with  it.   A  sharp  eyed supervisor,
though,  had  spotted  them  and  duly
reported  them  via  telephone  to the
police, giving an accurate description
of the pair of them, which enabled the
police   to  pick  them  up  promptly.
Supported  by  in-store CCTV evidence,
the   pair   were  given  a  suspended
sentence  and  had to pay compensation
to us.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  have  also  have  the  most stupid
shoplifters  ever  trying  their luck.
One  evening,  a  teenager came in and
was   spotted   stuffing   packets  of
sausages  up his jumper.  His exit was
blocked  and  he  was challenged as he
tried   to  leave  the  store  without
paying for anything.  He tried to make
a  dash for it, but the supervisor was
too  quick  and  grabbed  his  jacket,
spilling  the packets of sausages onto
the  ground.   He was held fast by his
jacket,  so  wriggled  out  of it, and
after thumping the supervisor, ran for
it.   The cashier had hit the security
button  in  the  shop, which calls the
police  immediately,  while a customer
picked   up   the   sausages  and  the
supervisor  walked  in with the jacket
and  handed  it  to  me, rather like a
trophy.   It  was  discovered  that he
hadn't taken the full priced sausages,
but  the  ones  which had been reduced
for  a  quick  sale.   The jacket felt
rather  heavy  on  one side, which was
caused by a mobile phone in the inside
pocket,  which the police examined and
used  to  call  him on his home phone.
When the police explained they had his
phone,  he  denied it was his at first
and  then  said he didn't want it.  By
this  time,  the CCTV footage had been
scrutinized   and,   as   the   police
recognised  him,  they  went  round to
arrest  and  charge  him  for assault.
After  release,  he  came  back to the
shop   and  ended  up  being  arrested
again,  this  time for criminal damage
and   threatening   behaviour!    That
little  episode  cost  him six months,
spent  at  Her  Majesty's Pleasure, at
one of the top-class establishments.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  best  of  the  lot  has to be two
local  drug  addicts, who shop-lift to
fund  their  habit.   Teenagers again,
known  to  all  the  staff  and  local
police alike, but they are very smart,
and  usually  know  where  to  target.
They  decided to try their luck in the
store  and,  noticing the cameras, the
tallest  one  of  them  reached up and
moved  the  one covering the chocolate
boxes,  so  it  faced  in  a different
direction.   Unfortunately,  he  chose
the  wrong  direction  to move it, and
unwittingly  targeted  the  other one,
having   a   grand  time  raiding  the
chilled  food  section.   We  couldn't
have  wished  for a better video as it
clearly  showed  him placing the goods
in  his  jacket and down his trousers!
When questioned after arrest, he named
his  accomplice  and  his  haul which,
fortunately  for  us, held up in court
and  the  pair  received 6 months on a
drug   rehabilitation   program  in  a
centre away from the area.  Sadly, the
detention  did  not work, and they are
both  still  offending,  although  not
together.   I  doubt  they  trust each
other now.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We get less shoplifting incidents than
larger  stores,  but  CCTV coverage in
towns   can  drive  the  desperate  to
out-of-town  areas.   In  our area, we
have  the  reputation  of  "the police
shop",  as  we do report all incidents
and  press  charges whenever possible.
The  general public could do much more
to  help  by  refusing to buy anything
from  someone  selling produce door to
door.     Coffee,    cheese,    bacon,
sausages,     chocolates    of    many
varieties,  washing  powder  and  baby
products   are   prime  examples.   If
offered  anything like this, please be
public  spirited  and phone your local
police, offering a description and any
other   details   they   may  require.
Ultimately,  we  all  suffer, as costs
have to be recovered, so prices go up!</P>
