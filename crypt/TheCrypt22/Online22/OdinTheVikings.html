                                 <font color=yellow><CENTER>The Norse gods</CENTER><P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At   the   end   of  the  Viking  age,
Christianity was generally accepted in
the  Nordic  countries.  It replaced a
heathen  religion,  with a pantheon of
gods  and goddesses who each had power
over their own domains.  Odin, old and
wise,  was  the chieftain of them all.
Thor  was  the  god  of  the warriors,
while the goddess Froy was responsible
for  the  fertility  of  the  soil and
livestock.  Loki was a trickster and a
sorcerer, unreliable and distrusted by
the   other   gods.    The   gods  had
dangerous  adversaries  - the jotuns -
representing  the darker side of life.
The  heathen  gods are best known from
descriptions  written  down  in  early
Christian  times, and perhaps coloured
by  the new faith.  Farm names such as
Torshov,  Frøyshov  and  Onsaker  have
kept their original heathen god names.
Present day Norwegian place names with
the  last syllable "hov" indicate that
there once was a heathen temple at the
site.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  gods  had  human traits, and like
their  Greek  counterparts  on Olympus
they  lived  a raucous life.  The gods
fight,  eat  and  drink.   Mortals who
fell  in  battle, went straight to the
table  to  feast  with  the  gods, and
burial techniques clearly tell us of a
need for the same paraphernalia in the
life after death as here on earth.  In
the  Viking  age,  the  dead  could be
buried  or  cremated, but burial gifts
were  necessary  in  either case.  The
amount of equipment the dead took with
them  reflects their status in life as
well  as  different burial traditions.
In  Norway, the burial traditions were
especially  rich.  As a result, graves
are  a  prolific  source  of knowledge
about   the   everyday   life  of  the
Vikings.   Everything provided for use
in  the  afterlife  provides us with a
window into the world of the Vikings -
even  though  time  has taken its toll
and  often  only  remnants are left of
the buried objects.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The   grave  remnants  supplement  our
material  from excavated living sites.
In  these sites - both in towns and on
farms  -  we find misplaced or damaged
articles,  remains  of  houses,  waste
from  food  making  and craftsmanship,
and  in  the graves we uncover some of
the  finest  personal  effects  of the
deceased.    A   violent   society  An
indication  of  the  violent nature of
society  is  the  fact that nearly all
the  graves  of males include weapons.
A well- equipped warrior had to have a
sword,  a  wooden  shield with an iron
boss  at  its  centre  to  protect the
hand,  a spear, an axe, and a bow with
up  to  24  arrows.   The  helmets and
coats  of mail with which most Vikings
are   commonly   portrayed  in  modern
pictures,   are   extremely   rare  in
archaeological material.  Helmets with
horns,   ubiquitous   in   present-day
depictions,   have  never  been  found
amongst relics from the Viking period.
Even  in  the  graves  with  the  most
impressive  array  of weapons, we find
signs  of  more  peaceful  activities:
sickles,  scythes,  and hoes lie along
side  of  weapons.  The blacksmith was
buried  with his hammer, anvil, tongs,
and file.  The coastal farmer has kept
his  fishing  equipment  and  is often
buried  in  a boat.  In women's graves
we   often  find  personal  jewellery,
kitchen articles and artifacts used in
textile  production.   Women  too, are
often   buried   in   boats.    Wooden
articles,  leather goods, and textiles
generally  do not survive the soil, so
there are many gaps in our knowledge.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  a  smattering  of graves, the soil
type   has   been  more  conducive  to
preservation.  In many areas along the
Oslofjord,  we find blue clay directly
underneath  the turf, dense and nearly
impermeable  by  water and air.  A few
graves  are  well  preserved  after  a
thousand years, and we have retained a
whole  spectrum  of articles placed in
the   pit.   The  treasures  from  the
enormous   Viking   ship  graves  from
Oseberg, Tune, and Gokstad - which can
be  seen  at the Viking Ship Museum at
Bygdøy in Oslo - are prime examples of
what gifts can be preserved for future
generations,   given  the  right  soil
conditions.   We  do  not know who the
dead were, but they obviously belonged
to the upper echelon of their society.
Perhaps   they  belonged  to  a  royal
family which, a few generations later,
unified Norway as one nation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  graves  at  Oseberg,  Gokstad and
Tune   have  recently  been  dated  by
analysis  of  the  annual rings in the
oak  material.   The  Oseberg ship was
built  around 815-820 A.D.  The burial
has  been  dated to an exact year - it
was  in  834.   The  Gokstad  and Tune
ships were constructed in the 890s and
were  placed in the graves right after
900  A.D.   In these three graves, big
ships were used as grave repositories.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only  the  hull  of  the Tune ship has
been  preserved,  and  the  grave  was
robbed   earlier  of  nearly  all  its
items,  but  enough remained for us to
see  that  the  ship was originally of
the  same  fine  quality  as  the  two
others.   The  Tune  ship was about 20
metres  in length.  The Oseberg ship's
length  is  about  22  metres  and the
Gokstad  ship  is  24 metres long.  At
the time of burial, the ship was drawn
up  on  land  and  placed in a pit.  A
burial  chamber was constructed behind
the   mast,  where  the  deceased  was
placed  to  rest  in a bed, dressed in
finery.    Copious   provisions   were
placed  in  the  ship, dogs and horses
were  sacrificed,  and  a large burial
mound was piled on top of the vessel.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  Arab  travelling  in Russia at the
end of the 9th Century happened upon a
group  of  Vikings  who  were  in  the
process of burying a chieftain in this
manner.   Ibn  Fadlan made note of his
observations,   and  his  journal  has
survived.   The  deceased  chieftain's
ship  was pulled ashore, and valuables
were  placed  aboard.   The corpse was
dressed in fine clothing and placed on
board  in  a  bed.  A slave woman, who
had  chosen  to  follow  her master in
death  was  sacrificed  along  with  a
horse  and  a  hunting  dog.  The ship
with  its  contents  was burned, and a
burial  mound was constructed over the
ashes.   We  have  finds  of  cremated
ships  graves  in the Nordic countries
and  in Western European Viking sites,
but   the   large   graves  along  the
Oslofjord  were  not put to the torch.
In  the  Gokstad ship a man was found,
and  the  Tune ship probably carried a
man  a  well.  However, two women were
buried  with  the  Oseberg  ship.  The
skeletons  are of a 50-60 year-old and
a   20-30   year-old.    We  can  only
speculate   as   to   which   was  the
companion    and    which    was   the
noblewoman.    Both  the  Oseberg  and
Gokstad graves were plundered by grave
robbers,    so   the   jewellery   and
luxurious  weapons,  which surely have
been  there,  were not excavated.  But
articles of wood, leather and textiles
- of no interest to the thieves - have
survived.    There   are  remnants  of
similar  graves in other locations and
it   appears  to  have  been  standard
practice  to  include  sacrificed dogs
and   horses,   fine   weapons,   some
nautical  equipment such as oars and a
gangplank,  balers,  cooking  pots for
shipmates,   a  tent  and  often  fine
imported  bronze  vessels.   Without a
doubt,  these  once contained food and
@5drink  for  the deceased.  The Oseberg
grave  contained  no trace of weapons,
reasonably  enough for a female grave,
but  all  the other standard equipment
followed.   In  addition,  the central
figure  had  been given articles which
testify   to   her   dignity   as   an
administrator  and a wife on a wealthy
farm.   We  have  to assume that women
have  had  the main responsibility for
carrying  out  farm  work when the men
were  off  on  Viking  journeys.   The
woman  from  Oseberg  was,  like  many
contemporary  women,  an authoritative
and highly respected lady, whether she
sat  with  other  women  at a spinning
wheel or loom, or watched over work in
the  fields, or supervised milking and
the  making  of cheese and butter.  In
addition  to the ship, she has brought
along a wagon and three sleighs.  Both
on land and water, she was prepared to
go   in  style.   Enough  horses  were
sacrificed  to  draw the wagon as well
as  the  sleighs.   A tent and cooking
utensils,     tools     for    textile
production, chests and small boxes for
valuables,  a  breadboard,  milk pails
and ladles, a cutting knife and frying
pan,  shovels  and  rakes, a saddle, a
dog  collar and much more was found in
the  grave.   Her  provisions included
two  slain oxen.  A dough of rye flour
was  placed  to  leaven  on  the large
wooden  breadboard,  and  in  a finely
decorated bucket, apples were included
for   dessert.   Many  of  the  wooden
articles were ornamentally carved.  It
appears as if a number of artists were
at   work  on  the  farm.   Even  such
utilitarian things as the sleigh poles
are  ornately  carved.  Aside from the
Oseberg  find,  our  main knowledge of
Viking art comes from metal jewellery,
where   the  format  is  modest.   The
choice   of  motif  is  the  same  for
woodcarving.   The  artists  have been
preoccupied   with   animal   figures.
These  are  imaginary animals, twisted
and   braided   together  in  a  tight
asymmetric  arabesque.  These carvings
are   superb   examples   of  advanced
craftsmanship,  so  the  Oseberg  wood
carvers  must  have been as handy with
chisels  and  sheath  knives  as  with
swords and battle axes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The man buried in the Gokstad ship has
also  had  the  service  of  a  gifted
woodcarver,  even  though  the find is
not  so  rich  in ornamentation as the
Oseberg grave.  The Oseberg ship has a
low  freeboard  and  is less seaworthy
than  the ships from Tune and Gokstad,
but  it certainly could have managed a
North  Sea voyage and could be typical
of  the  ships which were used for the
first  Viking  attacks around the year
800.   A  copy  which  has  been built
proved  to  be  quick to the wind, but
was  not easy to manage.  The Oseberg,
Gokstad  and  Tune ships were probably
the  private  vessels of rich persons,
rather than longships for transporting
warriors.   The  Gokstad  ship is very
seaworthy.  This has been demonstrated
by  replicas  which  have  crossed the
Atlantic  in  modern  times.  The hull
design  makes  the  ship fast - either
under  sail  or  when 32 men pulled on
the  oars.  Even with a full crew, the
Gokstad  ship  drew  no  more than one
metre  of  water,  so  it could easily
have been used for assaults on foreign
shores.    It  is  possible  that  the
Vikings'  experiences through frequent
sea  voyages  in the early 9th Century
led  to  a  rapid  evolution  in  hull
design.    If   this   is   a  correct
assumption,   then   the   differences
between   the  Oseberg  ship  and  the
Gokstad  ship  might  be  a  result of
three generations of experience in the
North  Sea  and  hours  of  discussion
between      shipbuilders      seeking
improvements.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1000  years  of development The Viking
ships  were  clinchbuilt.   The  ships
used  for travelling to distant shores
were  a  result of a thousand years of
experience   in   the   Nordic   area.
Shipbuilders   strove   to   construct
lightweight   and   flexible  vessels,
pliant to the forces of sea and wind -
working  with  the elements instead of
against  them.  The hull of the Viking
ships  is built on a solid keel, which
together  with  a  finely  curved bow,
forms  the  backbone  of  the  vessel.
Strafe after strafe was fitted to keel
and stem and these were bolted to each
other  with  iron  rivets.   This hull
shell     provided     strength    and
flexibility.   After  the  shipbuilder
had given the shell its desired shape,
ribs  made from naturally curved trees
were  fitted and these gave additional
strength.   To  increase  flexibility,
strafes  and ribs were bound together.
Cross   supports   at   the  waterline
supplied  lateral  support,  and extra
solid logs braced the mast.  The ships
sailed  were squarerigged on a midship
mast.   In a calm, or against a strong
headwind, the crew could man the oars.
As   the   Viking  period  progressed,
different    types   of   ships   were
developed.   There were ships intended
for  battle which were built for speed
and  a  large  crew.   There were also
ships   built  for  commercial  trade,
where speed was less important.  These
had  a  greater  girth  to permit more
cargo.   Trade  ships  did  not have a
large   crew,  and  they  were  better
suited  for  sailing  than for rowing.
Christianity  takes  over  The  Viking
raids  tapered  off  around  the  year
1000.     The   Vikings   had   become
Christians,  and  the conversion had a
restrictive  effect  on  their urge to
plunder.   Denmark,  Sweden and Norway
had become separate kingdoms generally
united  under  single  monarchs.  Life
was   not  always  peaceful,  even  in
Christian   kingdoms,  but  wars  were
steered  by  the shifting alliances of
the   kings.   Countries  could  enter
wars,  but  the age of private battles
was  gone as was that of colonization.
The trade relations established in the
Viking   period   continued,  and  the
Nordic  countries emerged as a part of
a Christian Europe.</P>
