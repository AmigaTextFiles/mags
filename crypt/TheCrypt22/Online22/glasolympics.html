      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE  image  of Glasgow as no mean city is alive and  well  on  the
      Internet.   The city's initiative in mounting  a  bid  to  host  a
      future Olympic Games is thus characterised<font color=white>:</font></P><font color=white>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Opening Ceremony<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>  The Olympic flame will be ignited by  a  petrol
      bomb  thrown by a native (preferably from Castlemilk area) wearing
      the  traditional  custome   of   shell  suit,   baseball  cap  and
      balaclava.  It will burn for the duration of the games in a  large
      chip pan situated on the roof of the stadium.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In  previous  Olympics,    Scottish   competitors  have  not  been
      particular succesful.  To redress the balance,  some  events  have
      been altered to the advantage of Glasgow athletes.</P>

<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 100 Metres Sprint<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>  Competitors will have to hold a video recorder
      and a microwave oven,  one under each arm, and on the sound of the
      starting  pistol  a police dog will be released  from  a  cage  10
      yards behind the athletes.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua> 

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">100  Metres  Hurdles<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>  As above but with added obstacles  such  as
      hedges, garden walls, old age pensioners.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">Fencing<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>   Entrants will be asked to dispose  of  as  much  stolen
      jewellery, and car radios as possible within the time allowed.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

     <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Boxing<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>   Entry  is  restricted to husband and  wife  teams.   The
      husband has to drink 15 pints of heavy beer.  He returns  home  to
      be  told by his wife that she hasn't made his tea.  The bout  will
      then commence. (Whatever happened to Zero Tolerance - Ed?)</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

      <font color=yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT">Modern  Penthatlon<font color=white>:<font color=aqua>  Mugging,  breaking and entering,  joy-riding,
      breach of the peace, and peeing up closes.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>

<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Closing Ceremony<font color=white>: <font color=aqua> The Olympic flame will be extinguished  by  the
      athlete  in the shell suit dropping an old washing-machine  on  to
      the  chip  pan  from  an  adjacent block of flats.   Juan  Antonio
      Samaranch,   president  of  the International  Olympic  Committee,
      closes the games and invites the youth of the world to assemble in
      four year's time in Edinburgh for the next Olympiad.</font></font></P><font color=white><font color=aqua>
