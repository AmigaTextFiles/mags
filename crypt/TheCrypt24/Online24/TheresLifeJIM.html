<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For decades now,  questions have been asked about other life-forms
and  U.F.O.'s.  In fact,  strange sightings in the skies have been
known  from  the  very earliest days.  These  were  most  probably
comets, or other space debris, but were they all?</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have taken photographs of strange flying objects 
    and told obscure stories of their occupants and of even being taken to be 
    experimented upon. Most of the photos have since been proved to be fake or 
    explainable, and tales of abductions or other encounters dismissed and the 
    persons involved ridiculed. But what of the others?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although some reports, after investigation, are found to 
    be nothing unusual and have reasonable explanations, some sightings remain 
    a mystery, leaving many unanswered questions.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term UFO, an Unidentified Flying Object, is given to 
    anything that flies which seems strange, or behaves in an unlikely manner, 
    and has given rise to many a strange tale over the past hundred years.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All reports mention little or no sound, tremendous speeds, 
    sudden appearance and disappearances, bright lights, or spectacular halts 
    and hovers, all unknown in current air transport. Some also produce an electrical

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UFOs gained the name ~Flying Saucers" in 1947, when a pilot, 
    Kenneth Arnold, spotted 9 craft flying in formation between the Cascade Mountains 
    in America. Astonished, he reported what he had seen when he landed. He described 
    their movement as similar to "a saucer skimming across water". Journalists 
    reporting the incident nicknamed the craft as "flying saucers" and the name 
    had stuck. Since that time, most reported sightings are saucer shaped.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all are described that way, however. Some are cylindrical, 
    or spherical, and some are reported as a glowing orb. There have also been 
    several sightings of V- shaped craft or V-formations. A V-formation of red 
    and white lights was seen in Arizona in 1997, which obscured the stars for 
    the distance of a mile. In 1951 a Texan college student took a photo of a 
    V-shape of blue lights near Lubbock, but investigators found a rancher who 
    had also seen the lights, and recognised them for what they were - plovers, 
    birds known to reflect the lights of cities they fly over with their white 
    breasts.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all these craft show up on radar either. Many reports 
    of sightings are given by people who are trained to examine the skies; experienced 
    pilots or air traffic controllers, people who have learned to differentiate 
    between normal and the abnormal. Many others can confirm their sightings, 
    as in the reported sighting in June 1954 of strange metallic shapes which 
    followed alongside an aircraft as it flew across the Atlantic. The passengers 
    gave the pilot's story credence, but the episode was never fully explained.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1986, a Dassault Mirage III fighter plane was surrounded 
    by twelve mysterious objects when over Sao Paulo. The pilot was alerted by 
    the Air Force, who had picked up the anomaly on radar. The pilot, however, 
    couldn't see anything unusual. Only when the mystery objects speeded up and 
    overflew the plane, could the pilot see them. He described them as similar 
    to multi-coloured ping-pong balls. Another Brazilian reported an explosion 
    over the beach in Ubatuba. The witness saw a 'flying disc' explode. Metal 
    fragments of the disc were recovered and analysed by scientists. They were 
    found to be made of a pure magnesium, made in an unknown way.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UFOs not not common just to the United States. There have 
    been reported sightings from all over the world, and not just by one or two 
    people at a time. Below are some of the major reports from around the world, 
    seen from the ground.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belgium saw a wave of sightings lasting three full months. 
    It started on 29th November 1989, when two Sergeant Majors from the Belgium 
    Gendarmerie were on patrol at dusk that day. They were travelling down the 
    road from Eupen to Kittenis when they noticed something strange. A slow moving 
    dark triangular object was hovering two hundred yards from the road at about 
    one thousand feet above a field and shining three powerful lights down from 
    its underside. In the centre of the three lights was a larger coloured light 
    which pulsed from red to orange. It was silent except for a low humming sound. 
    Suddenly the craft swung round and overflew them and travelled slowly to Eupen, 
    where it stopped again and hovered over the dam at Gileppe for 45 minutes. 
    When it moved again, it headed toward Baelen and Spa, and disappeared.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two Gendarmes alerted the Royal Belgian Air Force at 
    Beirset, which along with the Glons and Butgenbach radar stations, had already 
    detected an anomalous blip on their radar screens. They had ruled out ghost 
    contacts from thermal inversions, unusual electromagnetic interference and 
    other radar signals. Aachen and Maastricht air bases were notified and an 
    AWACS - an airborne warning and control system aircraft - was sent from Gelsenkirchen. 
    By this time the flying triangle had been spotted by a further 19 gendarmes 
    attending an event near Eupen. Other witnesses from the surrounding areas 
    had also called the gendarmerie to report seeing a UFO. As all the descriptions 
    were identical, there was no doubt that all were seeing the same object. The 
    sightings covered a two-and-a-half hour period. Just over an hour later, the 
    first two gendarmes saw another flying triangle much larger than the first. 
    It appeared at ground level from behind a wood, and climbed slowly following 
    the road. Both sightings were also witnessed by the Belgian military. In December, 
    the flying triangle was spotted again by hundreds of Belgians, who all reported 
    identical descriptions, just like the earlier sighting.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next few months, the Belgian Air Force were scrambled 
    to intercept the flying triangle, but each time, the craft was too fast for 
    them. Even NATOs F-16s were not able to cope with speeds of well over their 
    capabilities of 1,250 miles per hour. There were also a few false alarms, 
    which turned out to be lights from laser displays. Plans were drawn up to 
    respond immediately, should the vessel appear again, but only if confirmed 
    by radar and/or gendarmes. Through the night of 30th March 1990 and the early 
    hours of the following morning, these plans were put to the test. A citizen 
    of the Wavre region, 14 miles south east of Brussels phoned at 11.00 to say 
    he had just seen the triangular craft. The gendarme ran outside, and then 
    ran back to the phone to confirm the sighting. He called the radar station 
    at Glons, who confirmed they had it on radar at an altitude of 10 thousand 
    feet. NATOs radar station at Semmerzake also confirmed the finding and notified 
    the Air Force. The radar scans from both stations were compared and matched 
    with those from the earlier sighting at Eupen. Two F-16s took off and intercepted 
    the craft over Brussels. Several times, both aircraft locked their weapons 
    onto the craft, but before they could fire, the craft sped away "like a dancing 
    bee". Both pilots were highly trained and experienced, but found the craft 
    an impossible target with acceleration above 46G and such abrupt halts, that 
    any human pilot attempting such manoeuvres would have been killed. After an 
    hour, it simply disappeared. Many videos and photographs were taken that night, 
    and have been extensively analysed, including thousands of statements made 
    by witnesses. Authorities have no doubt that, failing any rational explanations, 
    they were indeed, looking at a craft beyond the capabilities of mankind. The 
    Belgium Minister of Defence said in Parliament that "the government did not 
    know what these craft were. This is quite astonishing as all over the world, 
    the existence of UFOs has always been denied.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK Three years later exactly to the day, 31st March 1993, 
    the flying triangle was spotted over the Midlands of the UK. The descriptions 
    were similar to the previous sightings over Belgium and in America. RAF Cosford 
    personnel also witnessed it, although the radar showed nothing. The meteorologist 
    at RAF Shawbury, a few miles away, saw it heading straight for the base, where 
    it came to a stop, and shone a beam of light down to the ground, sweeping 
    the area, as if looking for something. Then the light went out, and the craft 
    flew slowly away over the base. The Ministry of Defence ordered a full investigation, 
    but no feasible explanations could be found, despite extensive research and 
    questioning. The British government were forced to admit that they could offer 
    no explanations. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Was the craft the same as had been observed over Belgium, 
    and will it appear again? Mexico Mexico City citizens were preparing to witness 
    an unusual spectacular on the afternoon of 11th July 1991, of a total eclipse 
    of the sun, lasting for 6 minutes. Millions of people stood waiting and watching 
    for a natural phenomenon to take place, and were totally unprepared for the 
    drama which unfolded during the eclipse. Just as the eclipse had started, 
    a shiny metallic object appeared close to the eclipsing sun, and hovered there 
    for half an hour. After a television appeal for photographic evidence, the 
    TV company was snowed under with spectacular video footage which clearly showed 
    the craft during the eclipse. Further evidence was submitted of other sightings 
    over other cities in Mexico, both at the same time and on other occasions 
    afterwards. Mexicans were gripped with UFO madness. All videos were analysed 
    and digitally enhanced, and clearly show a metallic solid disk, and have not 
    been tampered with. Several videos show smaller craft alongside it which had 
    been previously invisible to the naked eye. Again, all craft appear to have 
    reached incredible speeds, far in excess of human capabilities. Again no rational 
    explanations have been made as to the origins of these craft. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">France During Janauary 1981 in Trans-en-Provence, a village 
    in southern France, Renato Nicolai was absorbed in completing a building near 
    his home, when he was disturbed by a strange noise. Startled, he looked up 
    to see a strangely shaped object in the sky above a nearby hill, descending. 
    Curious, he stopped work to watch the object, which looked like "two bowls 
    turned one on top of the other". He thought it was a military craft in distress 
    as it appeared to be falling from the sky. He made his way closer as the craft 
    hit the ground with a thud, before he realised that it had landed on small 
    legs. There was no smoke or flames, and it just sat on the hill. As he watched, 
    it made a shrill whistling noise and shot upwards and away at a remarkable 
    speed, after picking up a small amount of soil. He made his way to the spot 
    and found clear marks where the craft had landed. He told his wife, who naturally 
    did not believe him, until he showed her the marks. They then phoned their 
    neighbours, who also came for a look, who summoned the gendarmes. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the gendarmes arrived, they took statements and samples 
    of soil and plants from the area to send for analysis in Toulouse. Further 
    investigations showed where the craft had hit a wall upon landing. After analysis, 
    the samples and reports were sent to the UFO investigation bureau, GEPAN. 
    Investigators arrived at the site a month after the event, but nothing was 
    visible. They filed a report, indicating that the soil in the immediate area 
    appeared to have been crushed, as if a very heavy weight had been applied 
    at the spot. Soil samples showed that the area had been heated to 600 degrees 
    C, leaving deposits of iron, zinc and phosphates. Most of the plants in the 
    immediate area seemed to have been stripped of 50% of their chlorophyll, with 
    an artificial biochemical aging of the leaves.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The biochemists were baffled, and stated that they "had never 
    come across anything of the like on the planet". Another similar case to the 
    above occurred in October 1982. A strange egg-shaped craft was seen flying 
    over a French garden. It stopped over an amaranth bush for twenty minutes 
    before shooting skywards. On examination, the bush had been dehydrated, seeds 
    had ripened and burst, and the plant was left a dark brown colour. GEPAN were 
    called in, who took samples to compare with the earlier incident, but no further 
    conclusions were made public.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Australia Australia's most famed UFO sighting was on 20th 
    January 1988. The Knowles family, 3 brothers and their mother, along with 
    the family's two dogs, were travelling from Perth to Melbourne across the 
    Nullarbor Plain along the Eyre Highway, to visit some relatives. They travelled 
    through the night, to avoid the heat of the day. Around 1.30 am, the car radio 
    started picking up strange interference, before losing all signals. Around 
    15 minutes later, they saw something ahead of them on the road. At first, 
    they thought it was a truck with only one headlamp working. As they got closer, 
    it was clearly a truck, driving erratically on the wrong side of the road 
    - but the light was a glowing ball above the truck! Alarmed, they manoeuvred 
    their way around the truck and carried on. A little way further ahead they 
    saw a car with a similar hovering ball light above it. They began to follow 
    the car, intrigued. Unfortunately, the ball of light changed direction and 
    started to chase them. Although they tried to outrun it, the ball had soon 
    caught them, and landed on the roof of the car with a loud bang. Although 
    they still struggled to outrun it in panic, they did not realise that the 
    ball of light had picked up the car and it was no longer on the road at all.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mother wound down the window to get a better look at 
    the object and touched something warm and spongy, like a suction pad. When 
    she withdrew her hand in horror, it was red, swollen and cold, and she began 
    to scream. The inside of the car smelt of "decomposing bodies" and everything 
    was covered in a black, ash- like substance. Everything started to happen 
    as if if time was in slow motion, their voices sounded slow and distorted. 
    Then the ball released them. Only then did they realise they had been off 
    the ground, as a rear tyre burst through the impact, and they were jolted 
    around. They slammed on the brakes, stopped and ran for cover in some nearby 
    bushes. There, they watched the ball of light, fearfully. It seemed to be 
    searching for them, circling the area, using a sort of searchlight. As day 
    dawned, it vanished. They described it as "resembling an egg in a cup" and 
    it made a low humming sound. Their voices were still strangely distorted, 
    lasting for quite some time, as they changed the wheel. Things were just returning 
    to normal, when the ball returned. They scrambled into the car and raced off 
    towards the nearest service station which was twenty five miles away. The 
    ball followed, only disappearing as they reached the service station. There, 
    they told staff and truck drivers what they had experienced. At first, the 
    tale was taken as a joke, until the mother's hand was examined, which was 
    still swollen. Their dogs had also started to lose large clumps of hair.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 30th January, the Knowles family were interviewed by a 
    member of the Victoria UFO Research Society and their car was inspected. Although 
    the radio was now working perfectly, there were marks on the roof which correlated 
    with the story. Samples of the ash-like dust were tested and found to contain 
    large amounts of iron oxide, often produced by worn brake pads. One of the 
    truck drivers they had spoken to was a keen racing driver and he said it looked 
    more like silicon, and had a strange feel to it, totally unlike brake dust. 
    A sample was sent to NASA in California, who reported its findings. It certainly 
    did not come from brake pads and was made up mainly of silicon, carbon, oxygen 
    and potassium, with a trace of astatine, which is a radio-active chemical 
    only produced synthetically and was still radio-active, long after the event, 
    when it should have decayed. This helped to explain the mother's swollen hand. 
    The rear tyre which had burst was also examined. It had blown in an unusual 
    way. Normally, when a tyre bursts under similar circumstances, it would have 
    split apart, but instead, it had ripped all the way round the circumference. 
  </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite all the evidence, the event has been dismissed as 
    a hoax and several theories put forward. Either the tale had been invented 
    for insurance purposes to claim for the damage to the car, as they had all 
    fallen asleep, or the long drive through the desert had given them all collective 
    hallucinations. Other explanations for the ball of light include a meteorite, 
    a stray missile from Woomera Test Range in the desert, or some kind of electrical 
    storm or electrically charged tornado. Even the marks on the roof of their 
    car have been dismissed as being caused by a roof rack, which the Knowles 
    family state they have never fitted. Whatever the theory, it is certainly 
    clear that something strange happened that night, and for the Knowles family 
    it was a very real experience.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland Some places seem to have more encounters with UFOs 
    than others. These are called "window areas". Scotland has had a far share 
    of sightings in an area called the Bonnybridge triangle.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Comfort Inn in Falkirk stages official UFO weekends because 
    of interest in the area. These have been very successful, attracting UFO spotters 
    from as far as America and Japan, hoping for a glimpse of the strange lights 
    or craft which are often reported in the area. It is all due to an article 
    written in the 26th September 1992 edition of the Scottish newspaper, The 
    Scotsman, by Albert Morris, entitled "Where on earth did the Martians go?", 
    the content of which was the falling of UFO reports. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It drew attention, however, to the fact that Scotland lays 
    claim to two of the UKs window areas. Other newspapers, as well as TV and 
    radio, ran further articles implying Scotland's skies were teeming the UFOs. 
    The result was that Bonnybridge became a UFO hot-spot for hunters of aliens. 
    This was encouraged by the local council as a tourist attraction and appointed 
    Billy Buchanan as UFO officer, who started to investigate witnesses stories. 
    A wave of sightings had begun in March 1992, when three people walking down 
    a back road to Bonnybridge were scared by a huge blue light which made a whirring, 
    rattling sound when it came out of roadside trees. Buchanan appealed for more 
    witnesses and within a week, he had twenty two cases on record. Before long, 
    he had organised open meetings in the town hall, and demanded government action 
    regarding the Bonnybridge sightings. Pennines A tenth of all U.K. encounters 
    happen in a narrow moorland area in the Pennines, in a triangle stretching 
    between Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester, with the most intense stretch lying 
    between Bacup and Todmorden. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Strange encounters and supernatural happenings have been 
    happening in this area for centuries, and it is not surprising that UFOs feature 
    amongst the reports. Balls of light have been associated with the Devil's 
    Elbow, and Pendle Hill, close to Bacup, was believed to be home to "demons", 
    and ~witches" were tried there. A hundred years ago, a local constable reported 
    seeing a strange airship over Pendle Hill, and there was a report in 1977 
    of UFOs hovering at the summit of Pendle Hill. On 24th January 1979, Mike 
    Sachs and his wife, from Bacup saw a strange orange object flying silently 
    and slowly over the Rossendale Valley. As they watched, it descended, stopped 
    and hovered, then changed course and shot off at high speed. Judging from 
    it's position, Mike thought the object had landed in a nearby quarry, so set 
    off there with his camera to investigate. As he neared the quarry, he could 
    hear a strange voice saying "Portakabin, Portakabin" over and over in his 
    head.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he looked down into the quarry, he could set a group 
    of lights resembling a Portakabin, but when he returned the next day, he could 
    find no building anywhere in the quarry and nothing which could have looked 
    like a Portakabin. Other people had also reported seeing the strange object, 
    including two policemen. On another occasion, Alf Kyme spotted a dome-shaped 
    object surrounded with red rings descend into the quarry. A local taxi driver 
    had chased it until it reached the quarry, but lost sight of it there. The 
    Ministry of Defence claimed that all sightings were of a 'special exercise', 
    but the base commander at Upper Heyford denied the knowledge of any Air Force 
    activity in the area during those times, according to his records. The last 
    witness claimed to have seen the UFO whilst on Blackpool pier, with an RAF 
    jet chasing it. The strange craft dropped into the sea, and when the jet abandoned 
    the search and left the area, the craft rose from the sea, and shot off vertically 
    into the sky. The government hold all such reports for thirty years, before 
    being released to the public, so researchers will have to wait until 2009 
    for further details.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Russia During the days of the Iron Curtain, most UFO sightings 
    were thought to be new Russian craft being tested. After 1991, and the dismantling 
    of the Soviet Union, the KGB released files showing that, they too, have had 
    their fair share of UFO encounters. On 3rd February 1995, Privates Schepen 
    and Zhabanov from the Russian Army on guard duty at the Guzev fuel depot saw 
    a luminous dot flying low and parallel to the ground for several minutes around 
    midnight. A faint click, similar to a cigarette lighter was heard but on investigation, 
    there was nothing suspicious. Then they became aware of a bright light above 
    them, a luminous dot of green, similar to a flare with a tail like a comet 
    was seen for a few seconds travelling at great speeds at 18 metres from the 
    ground, before splitting into two parts. One part seemed to "go out", but 
    the other, larger one, descended and turned into a small dot, then also appeared 
    to burn out, before disappearing from sight. The following morning, two other 
    soldiers guarding another post at the depot saw something similar, although 
    they both reported a ball of light flying above the depot. He also said that 
    he knew of reports regarding similar events at the depot in December 1983. 
    No investigation had provided any explanations, but it was confirmed that 
    experimental aircraft were not being tested in the area at that time.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another incident was recorded in 1983, this time near Kursk 
    in central Russia, at a top-secret installation, by a high ranking officer. 
    At 6 am on 17th October, he saw a UFO, round with a bright halo around it, 
    with a darker centre, sporadically moving, changing altitude and brightness, 
    and occasionally emitting a beam of light down to the ground. It did not show 
    on radar, but observers from other cities who also saw it, said it was not 
    a star, due to it's erratic movement and the beam of light.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During 21st September to 28th October 1989, a large number 
    of UFO sightings were reported around Vorenezh, three hundred miles from Moscow. 
    In the Western Park, six landings and a hovering UFO were reported, including 
    the appearance of walking beings. A wealth of witness statements and videos 
    were collected, particularly from pupils at a nearby school. Inspection of 
    the 'landing site' revealed imprints indicating an object weighing eleven 
    tonnes had landed there, along with an incredibly high level of magnetism.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lieutenant Colonel Kornienko reported an encounter on the 
    night of 5/6th May 1985 of an object behaving strangely in the sky over Khabarovsk. 
    It was cigar shaped flying fast vertically emitting pulses of light from beneath. 
    On 23rd May 1985, a similar object crashed into the forest there around 4 
    am as reported by a senior navigator programmer and a meteorological section 
    engineer. It was elliptical, emitting light beams up and down of a dull white 
    colour, the lower beam being much more distinct, and moving at a high altitude 
    and speed.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hasan Kayumovich Rakhimov was on guard duty at Post Seven 
    of a military base, when a ball of yellow-blue colour, the size of a football, 
    suddenly appeared 30-40 metres from him. It was 19-20 metres above ground, 
    but appeared to bounce up and down as high as 50-100 metres as it hopped around 
    the base, before moving toward the dog breeding quarters and disappearing. 
    Could it have been ball lightning? Another sighting only a few weeks before 
    by two civilians out fishing on a lake in the same area, states they saw a 
    UFO around 8.30 at night, moving at a higher speed than any aircraft. It had 
    a searchlight beam but the beam did not reach the ground, but appeared to 
    scatter. The craft was clearly visible against a starry sky. As it came closer 
    to them, the engine on their motor boat stopped. After restarting, the engine 
    glowed from the ignition coil sockets before stopping again. By this time 
    the UFO was above them. As the UFO flew south towards Vladivostok, they spotted 
    a satellite above it, which moved at the same speed in the same direction 
    as the craft. They continued watching until the searchlight beam was switched 
    off, and the UFO was no longer visible. Were both sightings connected in some 
    way?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flying triangles have also been reported over Russia. One 
    report, made in September 1990, states that one attacked a radar station at 
    Kuybishev in Samara. The report was made by Corporal S. Dudnik, who was on 
    duty at the time. He described it as a large, black triangular craft, around 
    50 feet in length down each side, which landed slowly and vertically around 
    160 yards away from him, making a rattling noise. A flash of light came from 
    the centre of the object, which shattered the radar antennae behind him. He 
    could see no opening, but it seemed to be aiming at the target, and he was 
    directly in the path of fire. Nothing appeared to happen to him, but the antennae 
    collapsed and began to burn brightly. An inspection team examined the steel 
    parts of the collapsed radar antennae which appeared to have melted, who could 
    give no explanation of how a beam of light or energy could have done the damage.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">East Anglia Rendlesham Forest is vast pine forest near Ipswich, 
    which stretches across Suffolk, down to the coast at Orford Ness near the 
    nuclear power station at Sizewell. Orford Ness is known for it's lighthouse, 
    but also has other mysterious buildings belonging to America's National Security 
    Agency and used for research purposes. Nearby are RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge, 
    which at the time, were rented by USAF. On Christmas Day 1980, a UFO was spotted 
    by Gordon Levett, from Sudbourne, who was in his garden with his dog. When 
    his dog started barking frantically, he looked around and saw a UFO flying 
    directly toward him, shaped like "an upturned mushroom, glowing with a phosphorescent 
    green- white light. It stopped and hovered over him, around roof top height, 
    then glided silently toward RAF Woodbridge. In the early hours of Boxing Day, 
    the Webb family were returning from a Christmas party, driving down the road 
    through the woodland between Woodbridge and Orford, when they spotted a huge 
    white light through the trees, before plunging into the wood. They were used 
    to aircraft in the area, but this light was very different from normal air 
    traffic, and it was silent. The family were puzzled as to what it was. USAF 
    security patrolmen, Budd Parker and John Burroughs were on duty at the east 
    gate of RAFWoodbridge, and also saw the light in the sky, which, they said, 
    looked like a Christmas tree. When it plunged into the forest, at first they 
    thought an aircraft had crashed. Then they realised something odd was happening. 
    The craft had drifted downwards, under control, and there was no explosion, 
    or impact sound. All they could see was a mass of flashing lights. They phoned 
    headquarters, to be told that no aircraft should have been in the area at 
    that time. Base security despatched two men, Sergeant Jim Penniston and Herman 
    Kavanasac, to investigate. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A courting couple, hoping darkness would cover their lovemaking, 
    were disturbed by a bright light, and then the sound of something heavy crashing 
    to the ground less than half a mile from them. They just had time to hurriedly 
    dress when a military jeep came hurling down the forest track, lights flashing 
    and sirens blaring, toward the crash site. They realised something serious 
    had happened and fled.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Penniston and Kavanasac saw strange coloured lights flickering 
    through the trees and told Parker and Burroughs that a plane had crashed in 
    the forest and was burning furiously. They were not convinced, and explained 
    that what ever it was, had landed not crashed. Penniston took command and, 
    with Parker left manning the gate, led them all out into the forest. Radio 
    contact with base began to break down, the further they went into the wood. 
    Their radios were swamped with static as if they were in a massive electrical 
    field. Kavanasac remained at the edge of an access route, where his radio 
    still operated, to act as communications relay. Penniston and Burroughs continued 
    on.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They were sure they would find an aircraft ablaze, but as 
    they approached a clearing, the air was full of static electricity, causing 
    their hair to stand on end, and their skin to tingle. There they saw a strange 
    craft, around the size of a tank, conical and hovering about a foot above 
    the ground on beams of light. It seemed to be made of moulded dark glass and 
    had strange markings in black on the side, and it was bathed in a glowing 
    aura. Although he had no ideas, it was Penniston's job to ascertain what the 
    object was. As he tried to approach it, he was caught in a type of force field. 
    He found walking very slow, similar to wading through treacle. As he neared 
    the craft, it suddenly shot up in the air amidst a bright flash of light, 
    leaving him open mouthed in surprise. All the birds in the area left their 
    roosts and deer fled in terror. The hard light of the following morning provided 
    visible proof of the visitation; a large swathe of damaged trees in the area, 
    along with extraordinarily high levels of radiation detected by an A10 fighter. 
    Three indentations were found in the frozen soil which bore out the story 
    of craft having landed. Plaster casts were taken of the imprints, however, 
    little interest was taken in further investigations. The following night a 
    party was underway at RAF Bentwood, when the after dinner speeches were interrupted 
    by the night security officer, who informed senior officers that a report 
    had been received from a patrol near Woodbridge that the craft had returned. 
  </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A team of highly skilled airforce personnel was formed to 
    investigate. Between them they carried a dictaphone, geiger counters, and 
    gas powered arc lights. Burroughs was selected as part of the group. As they 
    approached the wood, no lights were visible, although they knew the craft 
    was there. Radio communications were swamped with static, as before, and a 
    relay was set up. The arc lights proved troublesome, and more had to be acquisitioned. 
    Notes were made on the dictaphone as they proceeded. The only lights were 
    from the stars and the lighthouses. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The geiger counter was employed and showed high readings, 
    getting stronger as they advanced. An infra red night vision detector picked 
    up heat or some form of energy source, with samples being taken of vegetation. 
    Burroughs led a smaller team deeper into the woods, and around 2 am he reported 
    back that they had found something. It was a glowing, flashing red light, 
    resting on a mist-like pillar, centrally split like light through a prism. 
    The light grew and changed shape as it approached. The form changed to that 
    of a large eye with a dark pupil. They chased the light through the woods, 
    and a field for more than an hour. Without warning, the object took off into 
    the air, then shone a beam towards the ground. Pursuit was now futile, so 
    the weary and wet men made their way back to base, where the light could clearly 
    still be seen over Woodbridge, the laser light shining down into the security 
    area. Civilians in the area also witnessed the strange phenomenon, hampering 
    the military's attempts to deny the occurrences.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone has their own theories. Me? I have yet to see a 
    UFO, but I have an open mind on this subject. Unless you can tell me differently..........</P>
