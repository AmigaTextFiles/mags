 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had been teaching my three-year-old daughter, Caitlin, the
 Lord's Prayer. For several evenings at bedtime, she would
 repeat after me the lines from the prayer.</P>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, she decided to go solo. I listened with pride as she
 carefully enunciated each word, right up to the end of the
 prayer:</P>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"> <I>"Lead us not into temptation,"</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> she prayed,</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"> <I>"but deliver us some E-mail.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Amen."</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One Sunday in a Midwest City, a young child was "acting up"
 during the morning worship hour. The parents did their best to
 maintain some sense of order in the pew but were losing the
 battle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Finally, the father picked the little fellow up and walked
 sternly up the aisle on his way out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Just before reaching the safety of the foyer, the little one
 called loudly to the congregation, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>"Pray for me! Pray for me!"</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

 those who put trash in our baskets."</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT"> A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were
 on the way to church service,</P>

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preacher was wired for sound with a lapel mike, and as he
 preached, he moved briskly about the platform, jerking the mike
 cord as he went.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then he moved to one side, getting wound up in the cord and
 nearly tripping before jerking it again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After several circles and jerks, a little girl in the third pew
 leaned toward her mother and whispered,</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>"If he gets loose, will he hurt us?"</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
