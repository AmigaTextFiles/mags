<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recording Industry Association of America, National Music Publishers'
Association Reach Settlement with Audiogalaxy.com</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New York, NY, June 17, 2002 - The recording industry, music publishers and
songwriters announced today that they have reached an out-of-court
settlement with Audiogalaxy.com, the Napster-like clone, which requires
Audiogalaxy to stop the infringement of copyrighted works on their
peer-to-peer network.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement follows a lawsuit filed in late May accusing Audiogalaxy of
facilitating and encouraging widespread copyright infringement - a last
resort step after repeated efforts to warn the firm of their liability were
ignored or resulted in ineffective attempts to fix the problem. The suit was
brought by the Recording Industry Association of America <FONT COLOR=SILVER>  (<B>RIAA</B>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, on behalf
of its member labels, and the National Music Publishers' Association
<FONT COLOR=SILVER>(<B>NMPA</B>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, on behalf of the music publisher principals of its licensing
affiliate, The Harry Fox Agency, Inc.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The settlement reached would allow Audiogalaxy to operate a "<I>filter-in</I>"
system, which requires that for any music available, the songwriter, music
publisher, and/or recording company must first consent to the use and
sharing of the work. The other key provision of the agreement is for
Audiogalaxy to pay the music publishers and recording industry a substantial
sum based on Audiogalaxy's assets and interest in resolving this case
quickly.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>"We are pleased to settle this case quickly. This is a victory for everyone
who cares about protecting the value of music," said Hilary Rosen, Chairman
and CEO of the RIAA. "This should serve as a wake-up call to the other
networks that facilitate unauthorized copying. The responsibility for
implementing systems that allow for the authorized use of copyrighted works
rests squarely on the shoulders of the peer-to-peer network."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>"The message is clear - there is no place on the Internet for services that
exploit creators' work without fair compensation," added Edward P. Murphy,
President and CEO, NMPA. "Such services hurt creators and hurt the
legitimate Internet businesses that wish to comply with the law and
compensate the creators. The swift resolution of this matter is thus a
double victory that creators and legitimate Internet businesses should join
in hailing."</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>   (more)</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
