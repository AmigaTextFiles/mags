    <font color=red size="+4"> Using Nero, The CD writing program </font> 
  </center></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the joys of using a computer today is having a CD-writer onboard.</p>
  <p>This allows you to do a variety of tasks that a few years ago would have been 
    out of reach of most people. Nowadays a fast writer will cost you approx..£60.</p>
  <p>A lot of newcomers find difficulty in using their writer, so I’ll do a quick 
    run down on how to create a music CD.</p>
<p>For this article, I’ll use Nero, which is one of the more popular CD writing 
  programs around. </p></blockquote>

<p>Nero came with my Liteon  CD/Rw drive. As you can see from the grab above, 
  it shows it as bundled.</p>
<p>Once Nero is installed you’re ready to go. You can always look in the preferences 
  of the program if you feel confident about playing about with the settings. 
  I’ll show some grabs of the preferences, but, in the main, I’ve left them at 
  the defaults. </p>
<p>The defaults mean that the program is ready to go once installed and I believe 
  you should only alter them if you really know what you are doing!!!</p>
<p>Ok, first screen. Alter the times if you wish for warnings on how full the 
  CD is.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>Let’s have a check at what plugins are installed. As you can see, I’ve  got 
  MP3Pro installed as well.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=296
src="Images/nero006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>I’m safe, I’ve no unsupported plugins installed………..and I doubt you will have 
  either. So, no point in having a grab of that bit .</p>
<p>You can alter where you wish Nero to cache its temp files…..make sure if you 
  alter this that you have enough space to handle them.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Yup, even though I tend to mangle it, I use English.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>I’ve stuck with the default sounds, though you can uncheck them if you don’t 
  want disturbed by the noise.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>I’ve left most of these at the defaults as well, I really don’t see much need 
  to alter them. However, if you really don’t want to confirm deletes etc, uncheck 
  them. It’s quite easy to click on a wrong file, however, so you could end up 
  losing something you didn’t want to.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero014.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>The buffer should be left alone unless you know what you’re doing!!!</p>
<p>Again, Nero tends to give helpful hints on the displays.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero016.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
  <p> Again……left at default. Leaving it at defaults means that if you put an audio 
    CD in the drive (say you’ve got two drives) and drag a song onto the display 
    , it can look up the title and automatically name it for you.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero018.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
  <p>Nero automatically ejects the CD after burning it, you can alter this behavior 
    as well…….</p>
<p>Overburning, again, is for experts. If you must  alter this, you may end up 
  with a lot of Frisbees.</p>
<p> <img width=398 height=496
src="Images/nero020.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>Ok, that’s a very fast look at the preferences, there are a helluva lot more 
  things to alter in this program. One of the many reasons its so popular.</p>
<p>Back to the normal browser window.</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=356
src="Images/nero022.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>Click on the new compilation icon……shown highlighted</p>
<p>This brings up the wizard………</p>
<p> <img width=447 height=374
src="Images/nero024.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>Nice and easy……….</p>
<p> <img width=447 height=374
src="Images/nero026.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>Decide what you want to do……I want an audio CD……</p>
<p> <img width=447 height=374
src="Images/nero028.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>D’Oh! Not only does it show you the burn icon…..it even tells you where it 
  is. </p>
<p>Making your compilation is a simple matter of dragging tracks , whether they 
  be in Wav, Mp3, etc onto the audio1 window.</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=356
src="Images/nero030.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>Keep doing this until you have all the tracks you want or you have exhausted 
  the space on the CD you are going to burn. The line at the bottom tells you 
  how much time your compilation is going to play for.</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=356
src="Images/nero032.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"> </p>
<p>That’s the really simple method done, more or less, it just remains to press 
  the burn icon.</p>
<p> <img width=447 height=374
src="Images/nero034.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1041"> </p>
<p>I use just the Burn option ……I don’t (usually) create coasters, so I don’t 
  bother testing the compilation.</p>
<p>There, that was very easy……..</p>
<p>As I said, Nero is a wonderful program, nice and easy to use for beginners.</p>
<p>But, it can do a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Again, this is very graphic intensive, but I may as well show you some more 
  of the options you can use.</p>
<p>We made our compilation, but just suppose………</p>
<p>we downloaded most of these songs.</p>
<p>They’ve come from various sources and the volumes of the songs are all different. 
  You don’t want to constantly fiddle with the controls while you’re listening 
  to your Cd, so what can we do to rectify that?</p>
<p>Lets go back to the  main display.</p>
<p>Right click on one of the songs………and select properties.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=367
src="Images/nero036.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1042"> </p>
<p>Here you can alter the pause between tracks……</p>
<p>In the indexes part, you can alter where you want the track to be read as the 
  start e.g. a live track with speech at the start.</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=367
src="Images/nero038.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1043"> </p>
<p>Filters…………</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=367
src="Images/nero040.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1044"> </p>
<p>Read the part describing normalise……..ring any bells?</p>
<p>Yup, Nero can do an awful lot to help make your compilation sound great.</p>
<p>And that’s the easy part!!!</p>
<p>If you remember, you selected properties by right clicking on the file in the 
  compilation……..lets try selecting audio editor instead……..</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=420
src="Images/nero042.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1045"> </p>
<p>Wowsers, this should keep you busy for a while trying out everything on this!!</p>
<p>From here you can equalise the song…….</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=428
src="Images/nero044.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1046"> </p>
<p>You thought the song could use more bass and treble……..why not give it some, 
  then?</p>
<p>How about noise reduction……….</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=269
src="Images/nero046.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1047"> </p>
<p>Chorus……..</p>
<p> <img width=554 height=205
src="Images/nero048.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1048"> </p>
</center><blockquote>
<p>You can much of anything to your song in this part of the program…….in fact, 
  you could end up staying in this part for days, rather than just burning a compilation 
  to listen to.</p>
<p>Nero’s audio editor is a multi featured  program in its own right. Most people 
  using Nero don’t bother either reading or trying out some of its options. Hopefully, 
  this has shown some things you didn’t know about Nero.</p>
<p>If you only want to burn a compilation…………..use the simple method, but if you 
  want more out of the compilation, be prepared to wade through all the options 
  until you find what you want to do…….and how to do it.</p>
<p>Enjoy!!! </p>
