<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<FONT COLOR=AQUA> <P ALIGN="LEFT">One evening a grandson was talking to his grandfather about current
 events.</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">He asked what he thought about the shootings at schools, the computer
 age, and just things in general.</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The granddad replied, "Well, let me think a minute ...  I was born
 before television, penicillin, polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox, contact
 lenses, Frisbees and the pill."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> "There was no radar, credit cards, laser beams or ball-point pens.
 Man had not invented pantyhose, air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes
 dryers, well the clothes were hung out to dry in the fresh air and man
 hadn't yet walked on the moon."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Your grandmother and I got married first-and then lived together.
 Every family had a father and a mother, and every boy over 14 had a
 rifle that his dad taught him how to use and respect.  And they went
 hunting and fishing together.  Until I was 25, I called every man older
 than I, 'Sir' -and after I turned 25, I still called policemen and every man with a
 title, 'Sir.'"</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Sundays were set aside for going to church as a family, helping those
 in need, and visiting with family or neighbors."</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"We were before gay-rights, computer-dating, dual careers, daycare
 centers, and group therapy."</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Our lives were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and
 common sense.  We were taught to know the difference between right and
 wrong and to stand up and take responsibility for our actions."</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Serving your country was a privilege; living here was a bigger
 privilege.  We thought fast food was what people ate during Lent.
 Having a meaningful relationship meant getting along with your cousins."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Draft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the evening
 breeze started."</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Time-sharing meant time the family spent together in the evenings and
 weekends-not purchasing condominiums."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "We never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters,
 yogurt, or guys wearing earrings.  We listened to the Big Bands, Jack
 Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios.  And I don't ever
 remember any kid blowing his brains out listening to Tommy Dorsey."</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"If you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk.
 The term 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of.  We had
 5 & 10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and
 10 cents."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Ice cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were
 all a nickel.  And if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your
 nickel on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "You could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600, but who could afford one?
 Too bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "In my day, 'grass' was mowed, 'coke' was a cold drink, 'pot' was
 something your mother cooked in, and 'rock music' was your grandmother's
 lullaby."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "'Aids' were helpers in the Principal's office, 'chip' meant a piece of
 wood, 'hardware' was found in a hardware store, and 'software' wasn't
 even a word."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "And we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady needed
 a husband to have a baby."</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "No wonder people call us 'old and confused' and say there is a
 generation gap and how old do you think I am - ????"</P>
