<P><FONT color=#00ffff>Despite the amount of mud that's slung at Microsoft these 
days, there can't be many folk who honestly think the PC is really worse off as 
a result of the company's efforts. In the early days PCs were awkward to use and 
new hardware was very difficult to get working and the lack of common standards 
often meant that getting information from one computer to another was a 
nightmare.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00ffff>Like it or not, the fact is we don't have to mess around 
  just to get a simple program running, or create a script of instructions to 
  get online is largely thanks to Windows. I have to admit that some early versions 
  of Windows were a pain in the arse to use and an unexpected system crash at 
  best lost all your unsaved work. In the worse case you could be faced with a 
  complete reinstall of the OS! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00ffff>Things have changed now with the recent release of Windows 
  XP, the most stable of all Microsoft's operating systems. I have been using 
  Windows XP for nearly eight months now with out one single crash or system lockup. 
  So what's so special about XP? Well in reality Windows XP is a Windows NT chassis 
  with a Windows ME body, but out goes the old bulky and slow DOS engine and in 
  comes a lean, mean and fast integrated DOS. Windows XP is NOT just another upgrade, 
  it is a brand new, completely rewritten operating system. Let's now take a look 
  at it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#00ffff>So what does Windows XP look and feel like? Lets run it 
  and see. Firstly after Windows XP has loaded we are presented with the Logon 
  Screen. As you can see I have set up Windows XP with four user accounts, one 
  for each member of the family and each protected by its own password.</FONT> 
  <font color="#00FFFF">This allows each member of my family to have in fact their 
  own personal computer set up as they wish and running their own choice of software.</font> 
  <font color="#00FFFF">It's like having 4 separate PC's.</font>

    </tr>
</Table>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">The new start menu is your launch pad and takes you to 
  where ever you want to go on your PC. This is one of the first improvements 
  you will notice over previous versions of Windows. It uses an intuitive approach 
  to get you where you want faster. The programs you use frequently are recognized 
  by Windows XP and are positioned more prominently in the menu. Even the button 
  to open the start menu has been made bigger and more noticeable.</font></p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF">Access to other parts of your PC have also been improved. 
  Items such as the Control Panel, My Documents and My Computer are quicker to 
  locate. You can also open up My Pictures and My Music without having to trawl 
  through your hard drive with Explorer.</font></p>

  <tr> 
    <td colspan=1 ALIGN=CENTER bgcolor=red><font size="+1"color=white><b>Control Panel</b></font> </td>
  <tr valign=top> 
    </tr>
</Table>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">The Control Panel is the toolbox, if you 
  like, within Microsoft Windows XP, and this is where you will find the utilities 
  you need to master your PC, whether you want to change a setting or fix a problem. 
  In the past the Control Panel was something of a mystery to most PC users. It 
  contained dozens of icons but with no hint as to what they would do or what 
  they were for. This meant that a lot of simple problems took a long time to 
  fix and often needed the help of an expert friend.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">Thankfully this has all changed in Windows 
  XP, and now anyone can harness the power of the Control Panel, even complete 
  beginners. In fact, the increased importance of the Control Panel in every day 
  use is highlighted by the fact that it now has its own entry in the Start Menu, 
  as well as a couple of shortcuts to it within My Computer.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">The Control Panel provides you with the 
  ability to to add and remove programs and hardware, change the appearance of 
  your Desktop, manage your network and internet connections, configure your sound 
  properties, set up new user accounts, maintain your PC and adjust the regional 
  settings such as time and date. This redesigned interface means that you can 
  achieve the results you want without any fuss or bother.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">Keeping up to date.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">The Control Panel is also the centre for 
  keeping Windows XP up to date. The <b>Windows Update </b>function monitors your 
  PC and the Microsoft web site while you're on line. When it finds new patches 
  and fixes for your hardware or software it offers to download them automatically.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">The Control Panel Options.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">The Control Panel has a whole new look to 
  fit in with the rest of the operating system. You have the option of viewing 
  the contents of the Control Panel on one of two ways. Firstly there is the <b>Classic 
  </b>view in which you can see all of the control icons at once as with previous 
  versions of Windows. Secondly there is the<b> new Category </b>view which works 
  in a slightly different way. The Control Panel is broken down into entries and 
  categories - for example, in the <b>Appearance and Themes </b>category, you 
  will have the option to change your screen saver and Desktop.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF">Let's take a tour of the Control Panel and 
  see what it does in more detail.</font></p>

  or you may chose from several built in ready to use themes. In the screengrab

<P align=left><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">See Basic Information About Your

<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">From here you can find out what processor

  hardware profiles, check on memory settings and change the amount of virtual 
  memory your computer uses. Windows XP now allows Remote Assistance, this facility 
  can be selected from here and will allow a friend also running Windows XP remote 
  online access to your computer. You find out who are your friends are if you 
  decide to use this !!</font></P>
<P align=left><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">Adjust Visual Effects.</font></P>
<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">This <b>Category </b>allows you to customize 
  the way that Windows XP looks and runs. You can select from many options and 
  adjust either for appearance or performance or both. You may even decide to 
  let Windows XP decide what's best for your computer. I decided to uses this 
  option and found it speed up tasks no end !.</font></P>
<P align=left><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">Free Up Hard Disk Space.</font></P>
<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">This <b>Category</b> is the familiar Disk 
  Cleanup utility that allows you to delete temporary internet files, off line 
  web pages, other temporary files and generally free up hard disk space. Nothing 
  new here other than the new GUI that Windows XP uses.</font></P>
<P align=left><font size="+1" color="#D7289A">Rearrange Items On Your Hard disk 
  To Make Programs Run Faster.</font></P>
<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">When I first saw this <b>Category</b> I thought, 
  &quot;This is something new&quot;, however it is the old Disk Defragmenter program. 
  However it does need to be used from time to time especially if you are adding 
  and deleting items and in my case there are 4 users. The Disk Defragmenter has 
  an Analyze option and it only takes a few minutes to see if your hard drive 
  would benefit from its use. Windows XP will tell you if your hard disk requires 
  defragmenting or not. Remember to set aside some time if you have a large hard 
  disk as defragmenting a 80 gigabyte drive could take several hours. Again a 
  nice GUI.</font></P>

<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">One of the biggest headaches with any computer 
  system is setting up and getting a printer to work properly. This burden is 
  taken off the Windows XP users shoulders by the program within the Printers 
  And Other Hardware category. Here you can view what printer drivers are already 
  installed by clicking on View installed printers or fax printers or click on 
  Add a printer. This will take to straight to and install printer Wizard where 
  you only have to follow the simple stages to get the job done. It could not 
  have been made easier for you. </font></P>

<P align=left><font color="#00FFFF">Other devices and hardware can be added just

  have connected at bootup so you really not have to come here to install it. 
  However there are many other Wizards to be found here to fine tune the device/hardware 
  you have just installed. I added a twin fire button joystick with throttle controls 
  along with a Gravis GamePad Pro controller (Same as Playstation) and was able

  here that you can change the accounts details to suit your families requirements. 
  Passwords, names and restrictions on accessibility can be changed here. The 
  restriction on accessibility would be very useful if you wanted to restrict 
  a very young member of your family from playing a very violent game that was 
  installed on your hard drive. You have have work files that you don't want other

  explain now that I have only scratched the surface of the Control Panel and 
  there are many other finer details that I have omitted for that of space. Also 
  remember that Windows XP is a complete package and includes other suites of 
  software such as Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, Microsoft Works 2000 and 
  many other programs that have been revised to take full advantage of the new 
  Windows XP operating system.</font></P>
