<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>You know in the past month or so, Several people I have talked to,
Have  been  concerned  at the High cost  of  their  24/7  Internet
access,   So  much  so  that at least  three  people  I  know  are
concidering  going  back to paying per  call  and  limiting  their
Internet access to after 6pm and Weekends only.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>This  started me thinking about my own account (24/7  Blue  Yonder
£20  per month).  Slightly more expensive than most,  But  I  have
always had good service and see no need to change.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Now  £20  per  month IS a lot of money to certain  people  (Myself
Included) and perhaps it could be better spent elsewhere.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>However  after thinking a great deal about my use of the Internet,
I  have  come  to  realise  that the outlay  of  £20  is  actually
recouperated just by the Savings I can make on line.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>In  the  rest  of this article,  I but scratch the surface  of  my
Internet  use,  But have selected several instances where  You  or
anyone can/Could save cash by using the Internet.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Email<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :-</font></B></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior  to  going on line,  I used to purchase at least  £1.50p  of
postage stamps per week ...Around £6.00p per month.  Email has all
but taken over from Letter writing and high postal charges.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However this is not the only way I save money by using email.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Technical help Phone calls cost an "<I>Arm and a Leg</I>" ..Up to £1.00 a
minute!  ..  However most companies will happily respond  to  your
email queerie at no extra cost to yourself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mailing lists are another great source of Free information. Select
a    list    concerning   a   subject   close   to   your    heart
Computing/Gardening/ Caravanning etc. Most people on these Mailing
lists  may  possess a greater knowledge than you and will  happily
assist with any question you may have.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  do  realise  that  certain people are concerned  about  passing
Credit card details over the Internet,  However Handing your  card
to a Waiter in a Resturant can be just as dangerous.</P>

Racing circuit (<I>Some 30 minute drive from our house</I>).</P>

house  in an area you don't know ..  Or perhaps Friends or  Family
have just moved home to a New housing Scheme.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes we can purchase Town Street Maps .. However these are normally
outdated  when  you  buy them,  They might contain  several  Blank
Streets,  Meaning that when the Map was printed,  the Street names
had not been decided.</P>
