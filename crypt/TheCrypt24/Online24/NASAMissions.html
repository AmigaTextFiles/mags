<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  is  a compilation of material relating to NASA and sightings by
astronauts  of  UFO's.   The  material  contained herein is not of an
original  nature but can be found in the sources listed at the end of
the  article.  There has been much discussion on astronaut sightings,
to  help stimulate discussion and get us all up to speed on the topic
I  thought  it  would  be  informative  to  collect all the available
material.   I  have  attempted  to  collect the facts and present the
opinions both pro and con conserning each incident.</P>


  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you were on a mission to study the inhabitants of the planet 
    we call earth would you not be interested in the primitive attempts at early 
    space travel. It seems that UFO's have been especially interested in following 
    our space program. Just what do our astronauts know that they aren't talking 
    about? What did we find when we went to the moon? The astronauts that returned 
    from the moon seemed to be profoundly changed by the experience. Why did we 
    seemingly abandon our space program following the lunar landings? Why did 
    the Russians not even attempt to go to the moon? Was being second so bad or 
    were they warned away from that goal. These are all profound questions which 
    I cannot attempt to answer. But let's examine the evidence that has been collected 
    and then each come to our own conclusions.</P>

    this flight He did in fact take a picture of a tracking ballon which was ejected 
    from the capsule. This picture which was enlarged and photographed through

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On his final orbit Cooper radioed Muchea tracking station 
    near Perth Australia that he was being approached by a greenish object moving 
    east to west. This is unusual in that it is the opposite direction from most 
    manmade orbits. More than 100 persons saw the object on tracking gear. Following 
    the mission newsmen were informed that they would not be allowed to question 
    Cooper on this aspect of the flight.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also reported that a voice transmission was picked 
    up on a special frequency which could not be correlated with any known language.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that Cooper has publically denied having 
    seen any UFO in connection with this flight. He did confirm that he saw the 
    Aurora Australis which was multi-colored and may have been taken by some as 
    a UFO sighting.</P>

    Later over the Caribbean both astronauts report seeing two more objects. One 
    of the movie frames was released to the press and has been reprinted in many 
    books including Frank Edward's book "Flying Saucers Serious Business". The 
    photo shows an egg shaped object with a comet like trail or glow coming out 
    of it. The movie camera was using 16mm Eastman color film shooting at 6 frames 
    per second. The object was yellow - white in color. In the transcript that 
    follows McDivitt is reporting to the Capsule Communicator.</P>

    that what he saw was a manmade satellite which was probably not acknowledged 
    for defence security reasons. Unlike many of the astronauts McDivitt has been 
    willing to speak about his incident with the public and press.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supposedly two ufo's hovered overhead as Armstrong prepared

    they claim to be some of these photographs in their June 1975 issue. They 
    claim to have gotten the pictures from a Japanese source.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thats interesting because I recall watching the broadcast 
    of this historic event on the Canadian network coverage. You know I seem to 
    recall them discussing at some point a light which kept appearing while the 
    astronauts were actually on the surface. I recall thinking that it was really 
    interesting and then it just seemed to be dropped. I dont think that I am 
    that senile yet . Do any of you reading this have similar recollections. If 
    so please let me know.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One explanation for the halo's seen around or near some of 
    the Appollo astronauts was that it was gases being vented from their backpacks. 
    I have one picture which was reported to be something unusual in close proximity 
    to one of the astronauts. It would clearly appear to be coming from the backpack

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good uses "SAGA UFO SPECIAL 3" as a source for this quote. 
    The following is an excerpt from the transcript of the Apollo 11 technical 
    debriefing.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>The first unusual thing that we saw I guess was one 
    day out or something pretty close to the moon. It had a sizeable dimension 
    to it, so we put the monocular on it.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Collins: <I>How'd we see this thing? Did we just look out the 
    window and there it was</I>.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>Yes, and we weren't sure but what it might be the 
    S-IVB. We called the ground and were told the S-IVB was 6,000 miles away. 
    We had a problem with the high gain about this time, didn't we?</I></P>
  Collins <I>There was something. We felt a bump or maybe I just imagined it.</I> 
  <p></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Armstrong: <I>He was wondering whether the MESA had come off.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Collins:<I> I don't guess we felt anything.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aldrin: <I>Of course, we were seeing all sorts of little 
    objects going by at the various dumps and then we happened to see this one 
    brighter object going by. We couldn't think of anything else it could be other 
    than the S-IVB. We looked at it through the monocular and it seemed to have 
    a bit of an L shape to it.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Armstrong:<I> Like an open suitcase.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>We were in PTC at the time so each of us had a chance 
    to take a look at this and it certainly seemed to be within our vicinity and 
    of a very sizeable dimension.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Armstrong: <I>We should say it was right at the limit of the 
    resolution of the eye. It was very difficult to tell what shape it was. And 
    there was no way to tell the size without knowing the range or the range without 
    knowing the size.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>So then I got down in the LEB and started looking 
    for it in the optics. We were grossly misled because with the sextant off 
    focus what we saw appeared to be a cylinder.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Armstrong: <I>Or really two rings.</I></P>
  P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>Yes.</I> 
  <p></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Armstrong: <I>Two rings. Two connected rings.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>Yes.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Collins: <I>No, it looked like a hollow cylinder to me. It didn't 
    look like two connected rings. You could see this thing tumbling and, when 
    it came around end-on, you could look right down in it's guts. It was a hollow 
    cylinder. But then you could change the focus on the sextant and it would 
    be replaced by this open book shape. It was really weird.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Aldrin: <I>I guess there's not too much more to say about it 
    other than it wasn't a cylinder.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Collins: <I>It was during the period when we thought it was 
    a cylinder that we inquired about the S-IVB and we'd almost convinced ourselves 
    that's what it had to be. But we don't have any more conclusions than that 
    really. The fact that we didn't see it much past this one period - we really 
    don't have a conclusion as to what it might have been, how big it was, or 
    how far away it was. It was something that wasn't part of the urine dump, 
    we're pretty sure of that.</I></P>

  <BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the middle of one evening, Houston time, I found myself 
    idly staring out the window of the Columbia and saw something that looked 
    a bit unusual. It appeared brighter than any star and not quite the pinpoints 
    of light that stars are. I pointed this out to Mike and Neil, and the three 
    of us were beset with curiosity. With the help of the monocular we guessed 
    that whatever it was, it was only a hundred or so miles away. Looking at it 
    through our sextant we found it occasionaly formed a cylinder, but when the 
    sextant's focus was adjusted it had a sort of illuminated "L" look to it. 
    It had a shape of some sort - we all agreed on that - but exactly what it 
    was we couldnt pin down. We asked Houston some casual questions: "How far 
    away is the Saturn third stage?" The response was in the vicinity of six thousand 
    miles. That wasn't it.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could possibly have been one of the panels of the Saturn 
    third stage which fly off to expose the LM and cannot be traced from earth. 
    We could see it for about forty-five seconds at a time as the ship rotated, 
    and we watched it on and off for about an hour. We debated whether or not 
    to tell the ground we had spotted something, and decided against it. Our reason 
    was simple: The UFO people would descend on the message in hordes, setting 
    off another rash of UFO spottings back on earth. We concluded it was most 
    likely on of the panels. Its course appeared in no way to conflict with ours, 
    and it presented no danger. We dropped the matter there.</P>

  <BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On day out on the earth moon leg of the trip the astronauts 
    radioed Mission Control that two flashing lights had appeared off the bow. 
    of their capsule. After rejecting the possibility that the objects could be 
    spinning pieces of the Apollo booster rocket the capcom suggested that they 
    could be the jettisoned protective panels. One of the astronauts replied " 
    Gee that could be, but one of those lights just shot out of here at tremendous 
    speed ".</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">James Oberg writes concerning this the following explaination 
    which certainly sounds reasonable. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take the Apollo 12 case. In this famous incident the initial 
    reports are indeed true, as the astronauts jokingly asked the earth about 
    some flashing lights. When told that they were probably tumbling pieces of 
    space debris (which do in fact accompany the Apollo in the vacuum of space 
    on the way to the moon), the crew accepted this and began discussing how far 
    away they would be. When asked how fast the pieces had broken off the rocket 
    the previous day, the astronauts replied that when they had turned their Apollo 
    around some pieces were flying off at a very fast velocity. That had been 
    the day before! The flashing lights out the window didn't go anywhere but 
    gradually faded out as the day went by. What happened was that UFO researchers 
    ( I use the term loosely) had simply misunderstood the space jargon and had 
    completely missed the gist of the conversation from Apollo, and had then (probably 
    quite honestly, with good intentions and closed minds) reworded the phrases 
    to make them "clearer" to the general public. In fact they had totally altered 
    the meaning.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this incident it should be trivial to get to the root 
    of the matter. All we need is the tape of the actual conversation or the true 
    unaltered transcript. We could then see if Olberg is right on the money or 
    not.</P>

    voice analysis the results of which are unknown at this time to the author.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gordon Cooper was one of the best trained US astronauts having 
    flown on Mercury 9 and Gemini 5. Yet he was not selected to fly an Apollo 
    mission. It is speculated that Cooper did not play the game correctly when 
    it comes to the UFO situation. It is interesting that Cooper has developed 
    an interest in ancient civilizations and in fact participated in an expedition 
    to South American that discovered the remnants of a very old and advanced 
    civilization dating back over 5000 years. One is tempted to ask why the sudden 
    interest on the part of a former astronaut in "ancient astronaut" type endevours.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fellow officer once said of Cooper. "We all knew where 
    Gordon was going to end up in ten years. He was going to be Chairman of The 
    Joint Chiefs of Staff. (what happened that he didn't?)</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July 1960 Cooper was interviewed by Yvonne S. Durfield 
    and had this to say about UFO's. "I don't take UFO's seriously. I would be 
    very skeptical." In March 1978 Cooper stated to the National Enquirer "UFO's 
    are definately real" It is interesting that his two flights into space occurred 
    between the dates of the two interviews. Cooper went on to make a written 
    statement to the United Nations supporting Grenada's Prime Minister Eric Gairy 
    proposal that the UN establish a UFO agency.(1979?)</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his book MJ12 & THE RIDDLE OF HANGER 18 Beckley quotes 
    Cooper as saying "UFO's are, I believe, very likely travellers from some other 
    planet; visitors from some other world that is hundreds of thousands of years 
    more advanced than we are, and they certainly have a far more efficient sytem 
    of propulsion than we have."</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During an interview on the Merv Griffin Show, Merv asked 
    the following of Gordon Cooper. "There is a story going around, Gordon, that 
    a spaceship did land in middle America and there were occupants, and members 
    of our government were able to keep one of the occupants alive for some period 
    of time. They've seen the metal of the aircraft and know what the people look 
    like - is that a credible story? To everyones surprise Cooper answers with 
    a straight face "I think it's fairly credible. I would like to see the time 
    when all qualified people could really work together to properly investigate 
    these stories and either refute or prove them." Later the next morning Lee 
    Spiegel a UFO researcher and aquaintance of Cooper talked to Cooper on the 
    phone. During this conversation Cooper admitted that he could have revealed 
    further information on the Merv Griffin Show but did not because he did not 
    want to raise too many official eyebrows.</P>

    WHY DID IT END SO QUICKLY ?

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The solar system held no limits, we were bound for the stars. 
    The plaque read "HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH SET FOOT UPON THE MOON ...... 
    WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND" We said that this was "One small step for 
    a man....one giant leap for mankind" Then shortly thereafter it all came to 
    a screeching halt. What had been a burning ambition was now just a smoldering 
    ember. Had we shot the whole wad on one quick try. Why did not only the US 
    but also the Soviet Union cancel its ambitious moon plans. Why did both nations 
    suddenly limit themselves to relatively low orbit missions. Did Apollo find 
    something totally unexpected out there that made us change our grand plans 
    ?</P>
