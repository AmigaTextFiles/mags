<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Highland pubs always ask for plenty of water when drinking the local single malts, this tells the locals that you like it so much that you want to make it last longer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After your first sip announce to everyone in the bar in a loud voice, "<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>This is pish!</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" from the Gaelic Piesh Na' lavvy meaning Water of God. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is a cable car from Edinburgh zoo to the top of Ben Nevis.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Because of its height it offers all year round skiing and there is a revolving restaurant on the roof of the castle.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often you will see men in bowler hats marching about playing the flute and banging a drum. This is a multi denominational religious ceremony and the object of this procession is to collect pictures of religious leaders which must be stuck to the drum. Any images, particularly those of the Pope, will be greatly appreciated.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a nocturnal thistle called a "Spiky Jessie" which is found on Calton Hill in Edinburgh. As these flowers only open at night a trip up the hill is recommended. Just tell a taxi driver that you want to go up Calton Hill to take pictures of the Jessies coming out and he will be happy to oblige. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Latin inscription on Edinburgh's coat of arms says "<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>You'll have had your tea?<FONT COLOR=AQUA></font></I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The most popular hotel in Glasgow is called The Bar L.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Old people are banned from Scottish towns on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
If you see any, gently restrain them until a police officer arrives. This may also provide an opportunity to get a hat as a souvenir. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Glasgow operates a policy of plain clothed street bankers. As it is well known that carrying small change can tear people's pockets, these bankers will approach tourists and ask if they have any spare change. Once given this money they will exchange it for coins or notes of a higher denomination. In order to deter criminals, these Bankers often dress in a scruffy unkempt manner but they are all highly trained in finance. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Edinburgh Zoo has an adopt an animal scheme and tourists may take home any
animal they wish. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At many beauty spots you will find musicians playing the bagpipes. They are employed by the Scottish Government to provide tourists with spending money which can be found in bowls beside them. Feel free to take as much money as you want.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">William Wallace escaped the army of Oliver Cromwell by jumping over River Forth at Perth on a motorbike.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you go to a concert by The Royal Scottish National Orchestra it is considered impolite not to shout "<FONT COLOR=WHITE>Hoots!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>" during quiet sections of music.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Celtic are known as the Gers due to being formed by Gerry O'Malley a Fruit importer who was the first man to introduce citrus fruit to Scotland. So if you walk into a pub filled with people wearing green and white say "<FONT COLOR=LIME><I>Up the Gers, I'm proud to be an orange man!<FONT COLOR=AQUA></font></I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" and you will receive a warm welcome. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
