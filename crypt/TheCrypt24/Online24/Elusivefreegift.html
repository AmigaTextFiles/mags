<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">How easy is it to get something you don't actually need or want?  In our
case, 
harder than you would actually believe!  Allow me to explain.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It all started with the washing machine deciding that, although 
    it would wash clothes, it didn't want to empty itself of water to allow access 
    to the clothes therein. On closer inspection, the fault was finally traced 
    to an inoperative water pump, having emptied and cleaned the filter, and finding 
    lots of small articles which we didn't know had gone missing, along with a 
    considerable amount of small coins amounting to £6.52 in total. Having decided 
    that a replacement pump for the washing machine was uneconomic due to the 
    age of the appliance, we applied ourselves to the task of finding a replacement.

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last few years, appliances added to our kitchen 
    had changed from white to cream or brown, and, having recently had new kitchen 
    units fitted in keeping with this colour scheme, we wished to find a new washing 
    machine which would harmonise. Manufacturer was not really important, although 
    both of us had strong views on what not to get, from previous experience. 
    So we start looking for a machine which washes clothes and comes in a cream/brown 
    tone. Simple, right?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. Not exactly. We looked in catalogues to try to get an 
    idea of price and models on offer, then we went looking in the shops to get 
    a better price. After visiting several outlets, it became clear that you could 
    get any machine you wished in any shade. Of white - only. Footsore and frustrated, 
    we went home.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Determination to find something to do the washing with, other 
    than by hand or using someone else's machine, drove us out again, before we 
    were swamped under an ever increasing mound of dirty, smelly items (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>especially 
    the socks from our ten- year old lad</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), who's also a muck 
    magnet. A new retail park had opened recently a few miles out of town, so 
    we went to browse, and listen to the spiel from the ever- so-helpful sales 
    assistants hoping for commission. There are washers with dryers, washers that 
    wash whiter than white, washers that think, washers that can hand wash (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>). 
    In fact, washers that do everything short of collecting the clothes for you, 
    driving them inside and making you a cup of tea while you watch. All in varying 
    shades of white - polar white, white, silver white, white, off-white, white, 
    white with a bluish, or pinkish, or greenish tinge, and white. Don't forget 
    the white. Oh, and sometimes in a grey colour, sorry, Silver. (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>And 
    white.</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we found one in cream - except it's not called cream 
    any more. It's called Natural Linen, but it's two shades of cream; a very 
    light coffee colour for the upper part and the lower part could best be called 
    buttermilk. It's the closest we have seen in a colour we like. It's about 
    the same size as the old one, so it should fit in the space allotted for it. 
    The price is reasonable too. Several places had it, so we chose the outlet 
    with the best price, as you would expect. We tell the sales assistant that 
    we will return the following day, with cash to purchase it.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following day, only one of us went, but taking the muck 
    magnet along. We thought it had better meet the person most likely to give 
    it the hardest work. If it didn't turn white from fright, or leave the building, 
    it could very well be the right model for us. We duly waited for the same 
    sales assistant to become free, introduced the muck magnet, and went to examine 
    the machine, which didn't flinch. Sold. Muck magnet noticed the special offer 
    of a double duvet which came free with the machine. Why, when you have recently 
    bought one, do you find one as a free gift? Don't need one now, he was reminded. 
    However, the sales assistant was pleased we had noticed, as she had forgotten 
    to mention it. Still don't need one, I said, I'd much rather have a new kettle 
    (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>in cream, of course</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), instead. 
    Can't be done, it's the manufacturer's offer, not the shop's offer. Shame. 
    Not to worry, she explains, we don't have any kettles in cream (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>surprise, 
    surprise</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), and you could always save the duvet and use 
    it as a present for someone. </font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Eventually the deal is done. A date is set for the delivery 
    and fitting of the new machine, including collection of the old one, on Wednesday 
    afternoon, three days away. The duvet will arrive with the machine. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We go home and wait. Wednesday is our joint day off work. 
    The day when we pay bills, go shopping, and generally try to fit everything 
    we can into 24 hours. This particular Wednesday, however, had everything crammed 
    into the morning, after I had had to go to work for two hours to cover for 
    sickness. The afternoon was kept aside for the receiving and installation 
    of the New Appliance. We spent an hour making a pathway free of obstacles 
    through the house into the kitchen. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cleared the unit under the sink of items, so it was easier 
    to fit the hoses, and shifted the table and chairs to make more room. Then, 
    with a well earned cuppa, sat and waited for it's arrival. And waited. And 
    waited. And got anxious and phoned the shop. </P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"When is it likely to arrive?"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Don't worry,"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> was the reply,<FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
    "the order has been confirmed by the manufacturer, and it will come in their 
    own vehicle, sometime before 5 o'clock. It's early yet, only 2.30, so give 
    it time."</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">At 3.30, we decided to allow Murphy's Law to intervene, as it 
    will, and start to mow the lawn. Whenever we try to do this sort of thing, 
    something always impedes progress. Not this time. The lawn looked splendid, 
    as did the flower- beds, freshly denuded of weeds. Still, no washing machine. 
    Well, we had tried. </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">At 4.45, the shop was called again. <FONT COLOR=LIME>"Where 
    is it? The sun has shone all day, there's a pile of clothes needing washing, 
    which would dry on such a day, and no machine to do it in."</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Don't worry,"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> they say,<FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
    "this manufacturer has been known to deliver up to 6 o'clock. Besides, we're 
    certain it will arrive as the duvet has been delivered to the shop." <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    Apparently, it was their offer after all, and it has arrived, and we could 
    collect it whenever we wished. We're not bothered, we just want the machine. 
    So we wait.</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">At 5.45, we phone again. Now they're getting worried. Duvet, 
    or no duvet, there's no machine on the horizon. They decide to call the manufacturer. 
  </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The phone rings; no joy, just an answer machine - the manufacturer 
    has office hours of 9 to 5 and everyone's gone home. However, someone else 
    remembers that deliveries can happen up to 7 o'clock when it's particularly 
    busy, such as Christmas. </P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"But it's not Christmas," <FONT COLOR=AQUA>we remind them, " 
    <FONT COLOR=LIME>"although it's coming quicker than the machine." </font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Miracles can happen. We can always deliver on another day, 
    if it doesn't arrive", they offer. "Name a day."</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Our next day off is next Wednesday,"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> we say. 
    </font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=Purple> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"But you don't want to wait until next Wednesday!"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    they say. Too right, we don't! </font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"We close at 8 o'clock, please phone if you don't receive it 
    by then"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, they suggest. <FONT COLOR=LIME>"But.....how?.."<FONT COLOR=AQUA>and 
    the line has gone dead, as they've rung off.</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">At 5 minutes past 7, the phone rings again. This time there's 
    a different voice on the end of the line.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=Yellow> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"I've got a washing machine on board for you. But I can't find 
    your address on the map. Can you direct me?<FONT COLOR=AQUA>~ We shout for 
    joy. It's the deliverer, and he's lost.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">One set of quick instructions and he's on his way. Except he 
    goes straight past the house and seems to be on his way to the motorway! Luckily 
    he's worked out that the houses seem to be getting fewer and turns around, 
    just as we are getting back on the phone. </P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Good morning,"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>he calls, jumping down from 
    the cab.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=PURPLE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Morning?" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>we say. (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>Is 
    this guy a complete nutter</I>?<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"It will be, when we get home"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, came the cheery 
    reply. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"We started at 6 this morning, and we've still got 
    two more machines to deliver in another town, before we can set off home. 
    We'll just fit your's and we'll be off."</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He and his mate quickly off-load the machine, do a very smart 
    swap around with the old one and re-fit. A quick test, stop a leak, and they're 
    away, leaving us to admire the machine and then scurry around finding things 
    to wash. It's very quiet compared to the old one, and doesn't dance around 
    the kitchen - doing the washing is not as entertaining as it was. We used 
    to enjoy the waltz on wash day and wonder where the machine would end up next. 
    Now we can have a conversation whilst washing, without having to resort to 
    sign language to make ourselves understood. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember to let the store know it has arrived, and they 
    offer to deliver the duvet having volunteered one of the assistants who passes 
    our house on the way home for the assignment. That's very kind of them, we 
    think. Top marks to all at the store. Mental note made to send a letter of 
    commendation to their head office for quality of service.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has all gone very smoothly so far, apart from the wait. 
    Again we sit and wait for someone, but we know it should be shortly after 
    8 o'clock, so it shouldn't be too long.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">How wrong can you be? After waiting until 10.30, and having 
    completed three wash loads, we assume he has forgotten to pick up the duvet 
    before leaving work.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">We didn't need it anyway, so there's no panic.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I phoned the store the following day to enquire regarding 
    the duvet, to be told the reason for non-delivery was due to not being able 
    to locate our road. As it was still in his boot, I gave precise instructions 
    to our address and was promised delivery that evening after 8. It didn't arrive. 
    I was getting annoyed now, being unable to pick it up ourselves, due to work 
    commitments, but thought that things could have gone awry, and as there was 
    no hurry, it could wait. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It didn't arrive Friday night either, but that could have 
    been due to said gentleman having made plans for that evening - important 
    date, night down at the pub with mates, something interesting on TV, last 
    episode of favourite serial, funeral of goldfish, etc.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Nothing arrived on Saturday either, so late in the afternoon, 
    the store had a visit from my other half, in his company vehicle which happens 
    to be a 24 foot tilt-and- slide recovery truck, with which he inconveniently 
    closed the car park. It certainly gained the attention of the store staff, 
    who became very anxious to help.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The duvet, it appeared, was missing, gone, not to be found, 
    absent without leave, presumably still recumbent in the boot of sales assistant's 
    car, who was not present and appeared to be un-contactable, either by home 
    phone or mobile. Enter the store manager, who was enlightened to our plight 
    and the circumstances of the free duvet. An offer was made to deliver the 
    duvet, when work allowed, and of course, the car park was re-opened, after 
    the manager had made suitable soothing and apologetic sounds. </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Exit one recovery driver to wait, and wait, and wait. All of 
    Saturday, and Sunday, and Monday. We didn't want it anyway, but now there's 
    a principle to be considered. I'd rather have had a kettle - regardless of 
    the colour.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I could have picked that up on the day I paid for the machine, 
    and I'll need a new one shortly. Kettles have a hard life in this household 
    - it's all those cuppas whilst you're waiting for deliveries.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tuesday morning dawns wet, very wet in fact. Grumbling as 
    I go to work, getting wet and uncomfortable, only to find that as the day 
    wears on, the rain gets heavier and heavier. No chance of getting any washing 
    dry today, then. Doesn't matter, I'm at work anyway. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Halfway through the morning, I receive a phone call from 
    the other half, who's on a break, having called in home for a change into 
    dry clothing. There had been a knock at the front door, and, having opened 
    it, he found a very wet and bedraggled youth, standing on the doorstep in 
    the teeming rain, wearing a very apologetic look, and holding what looked 
    suspiciously like a duvet in his hand! </P>
  <FONT COLOR=Silver> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Mrs. Green?" </P>
  <FONT COLOR=RED> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Emmm. No. Not unless the surgeon's knife slipped."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    quipped the other half.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Mrs. Green's residence, then?" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>he asked, uncertainly.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=RED> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yup."</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Then I have her free duvet here!"</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Then keep hold of it tightly then. This thing seems to have 
    a habit of eluding everyone; we don't want it going missing again."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    He handed it over, gripping it tightly, grinning like a Cheshire cat.</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"And now we've got it, we're going to nail it to the mattress, 
    so it can't escape!"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">There's just one problem. We don't know whose mattress to nail 
    it to. So it sits, still in it's plastic covering, until we decide who the 
    recipient will be.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyone want a well travelled 10.5 tog double duvet in exchange 
    for a working kettle in cream? A personal swap is recommended, due to it's 
    previous record. </P>
