<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>The  "Stella"  awards rank up there with the  Darwin  awards.   In
1994,  a New Mexico jury awarded $ 2.9 million U.S.  in damages to
81-year-old Stella Liebeck who suffered third-degree burns to  her
legs,   groin  and  buttocks after spilling a  cup  of  McDonald's
coffee  on  herself.</I> </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>This case inspired an annual award - The "Stella" Award 
    - for the most frivolous lawsuit in the U.S. The ones listed below are clear 
    candidates. </I></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> <I>All these cases are verging on the outright ridiculous and 
    yet (<font color=white>in the good old USA<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>) with the right 
    attorney you could win anything!</font></font></I> </P>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Kathleen Robertson of Austin Texas was awarded $780,000 by a 
    jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was 
    running inside a furniture store. </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the 
    verdict, considering the misbehaving little b@stard was Ms. Robertson's son.

  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>2. June 1998:<BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A 19 year old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical 
    expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the 
    wheel of the car, when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hubcaps.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>3. October 1998: <BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> A Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania was leaving a house 
    he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get 
    the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. 
    He couldn't re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage 
    locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation. Mr. Dickson found 
    himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi 
    he found, and a large bag of dry dog food.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused 
    him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of half a million dollars.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 4. October 1999:<BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas was awarded $14,500 
    and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's 
    beagle. The beagle was on a chain in it's owner's fenced-in yard.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog 
    might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was 
    shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun. </P>

    Lancaster, Pennsylvania $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it at 
    her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>6. December 1997:<BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware successfully sued the owner 
    of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window 
    to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> This occurred while Ms Walton was trying to sneak through the 
    window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was 
    awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>Mr Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City.<BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> In November 2000 Mr Grazinski purchased a brand new 32 foot 
    Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having joined the freeway, he 
    set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into 
    the back and make himself a cup of coffee.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Not surprisingly the Winnie left the freeway, crashed and overturned. 
    Mr Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the handbook that he couldn't 
    actually do this. He was awarded $1,750,000 plus a new Winnie. (Winnebago 
    actually changed their handbooks on the back of this court case, just in case 
    there are any other complete morons buying their vehicles).</P>
