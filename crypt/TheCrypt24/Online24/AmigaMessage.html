<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would first like to thank all of you who expressed your concern and 
shared your support for Gary Peake and his family when you learned of 
his heart attack. I can now share with you that Gary is looking 
forward to returning to work in the next couple of weeks. He, of 
course, was trying to send e-mail from the hospital (at one point, he 
thought that the beeping of a heart monitor was the logon sounds of a 
modem), but fortunately with his hands and legs restrained, as well 
as some very effective tranquilizers, they were able to keep him from 
the computer. Having said that, I wanted to personally thank each of 
you on behalf of Gary and his family for your kind words and support.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an amazing time for Amiga, and the Community. You have all 
been patient, more than understanding, and have dealt with more 
misinformation, disinformation and rumors than any one group of 
people should, ever. Yet, and happily, we are moving forward and 
gaining momentum. Admittedly, we have not been very public about many 
of our plans and activities, to date, but they are many and we are 
pleased to be bringing this news to you, The Community, as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One request: If you find this information as positive as we do, share 
it with someone. Call or e-mail your friends, Amigans who are 
interested but might not be following the news as closely as you and 
let them know that change is in the wind: that new, interesting, and 
most importantly: REAL opportunities will soon be here for all of us 
in the Amiga Community.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all see and hear hype everyday. We know it well, sometimes quite 
instinctively. What you are to read is not hype. These are true and 
sustainable facts. Reality. The real skinny. We could not sustain and 
maintain the hard work and dedication of the members of the Amiga 
Family, those people whom are working so hard to bring you real 
products, if there were not real opportunities for us to make a real 
difference and a real change for the better.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Did you notice the incessant use of the word "Real"? Good. Because 
what this Update is telling you is real.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quite frankly, I enjoy the almost daily updates showing where you can 
find Amigas today at work and play. I find it so exciting, and yes, 
rewarding, to learn how some are using Amithlon to bring Amigas back 
into usage, in places where they have not been in some time. I see 
new sales, a new sense of opportunity and a new spirit emerging. A 
spirit that challenges conventional thought and challenges us at 
Amiga everyday. We are here because of you. Your desire for new Amiga 
products, your desire that this platform, this valid, vital and 
pioneering computing concept should not be swept aside has fueled our 
desire to succeed and grow. We have survived when so many others have 
failed, because of you, The Amiga Community and the way you have 
challenged us to "deliver the goods". Because of that challenge, we 
owe these exciting opportunities, this "<I>Delivering The Future</I>" to you.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Now, let's roll up our sleeves and get started. We have a lot of news 
to share with you</I>:</P>

<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Party Pack purchasers? This is for you!</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of you received your Party Pack and in the very near future you 
will be able to use the discounts that are associated with your Party 
Pack purchase. Each of you will receive an e-mail explaining your 
options, and the process is simple:</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> <I>You may purchase the products directly from Amiga at the 
discounted price and the products will be shipped to your door.</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">or</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> <I>Once you have purchased either the AmigaOne with OS 4.0, or if you 
purchase just OS 4.0, send us a copy of the receipt along with the 
front page of your SDK manual and Amiga will send you back a check 
for $100.00!</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">or</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> <I>Let us know the retailer that you will be using and we will get 
them the $100.00 so you do not need to worry about it.</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not a bad deal at all. Each of you have had the chance to work with 
AmigaDE and many of you have become developers of Amiga Anywhere 
content, because of the party pack. Now soon you will be able to get 
$100.00 back when you purchase a new AmigaOne system.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">AmigaOne and Amiga OS 4.0 ? Update</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were more than impressed with the response to the AmigaOS 4.0 
screen shots and the live demonstration of the AmigaOne boards. We 
sometimes have trouble understanding how so many people, people 
interested in the Amiga platform and the progress we are making in 
bringing it back to market can stay hidden for so long. However, the 
facts are that we must make certain production decisions based on 
projected product sales volumes, and how quickly we can receive a 
return on investment. That's Business 101. So, one of the challenges 
for us is we decide on a number of units to build and then we see, 
from web hits and direct inquiries, that there are 5 times as many 
people who are interested in the AmigaOne than we knew were out 
there. You can file that under "<I>Beyond Our Expectations</I>".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AmigaOS 4.0 is going to include many of the features that were 
originally planned for later versions of the desktop AmigaOS. With 
the need to rewrite certain portions of the code, the Hyperion team 
has decided to go ahead and fold in a great many more of the features 
that they were planned for OS 4.1 and OS 4.2 into OS 4.0. Ben Hermans 
and the team have been doing a great job of keeping us up to date 
with screen shots, updated product features and current development 
roadmaps. I know that we will have more updates, regarding real 
development and feature details from Ben and Hyperion very soon, and 
trust me when I say that we are chomping at the bit to share these 
details with The Community. Right now, according to our last 
conference call with the AmigaOS 4.0 team, at Hyperion, we can see 
the exceptional progress and the feature set that is being included 
with this release is fantastic. This has been driven by you the Amiga 
community, and I know that you will all be very happy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AmigaOne boards are in the hands of the AmigaOne developers and the 
integration work is moving ahead quickly, but with the full 
realization that rushing the release to the public will afford no one 
any real benefits. Alan and his team at Eyetech has done a great job 
of "keeping their eyes on the prize". We are really pleased that the 
hardware is out there, and that the Amiga community is going to have 
the first new hardware designed for them, with their own operating 
system, in a long, long time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are real Amiga products from Amiga and their associated partner 
companies. Yes, it has taken longer than any of us had predicted. We 
too have shared your anticipation and yes, impatience, but some 
things can only be done one way: The Right Way. Having said that, we 
know that with the results that we are seeing, I believe that you 
will share this with your friends and other members of the Amiga 
family with us.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Amiga Community will soon have a brand new platform. You will 
soon begin working with the most sophisticated Amiga Operating System 
yet developed. There is great care and attention being paid to 
Getting It Right, with the features and benefits that you have told 
us that you, The Community, want in a new Amiga. However there is a 
considerable challenge that goes along with all of these activities 
and we are going to need your help in helping us make a determination 
regarding certain business decisions that will be made quite clear 
further on in this update.</P>

<HR WIDTH=25% COLOR=BLUE>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Anywhere/AmigaDE ? Why are there two?</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There needs to be some clarification of these two products: Amiga 
Anywhere is a subset of the complete AmigaDE. In speaking with 
customers and potential partners we learned that they were looking 
for the content, and not the complete DE for their environments. The 
idea was to have as minimal a build as possible for these devices. So 
Amiga created the Amiga Anywhere Content Engine. This is a series of 
lightweight products that offer the binary portable attributes of the 
complete DE, while delivering the features and products in a much 
smaller form factor. Development is continuing at a rapid pace with 
these products and we currently offer an Amiga Anywhere Content 
Engine for PocketPC, and Pocket PC Phone edition devices, and shortly 
for Smartphone, Embedded Linux, and Symbian devices. This will allow 
AACE content to run on all of these various products and devices 
opening up even wider audience to which we can introduce Amiga.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development is moving ahead quite well on both the complete DE and 
AACE, and you will see some new partner announcements in the very 
near future. These are customers who are going to deploy AACE and the 
associated content in a variety of interesting products.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is presently one other question about the current Amiga 
Entertainment Pack for Pocket PC devices, and why there is limited 
content for it. This is because we were creating a game console type 
of experience with this first release, and that it was designed to be 
closed. The idea was to pop the card into the device and begin 
playing a game, without taking the resources from the relatively 
limited memory in the device.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be an exciting promotion/contest that we will be 
announcing later in the week with regards to AACE and the 
Entertainment Packs. We assure you, this will be a great deal of fun, 
and we look forward to introducing Amiga to several new customers who 
are currently using PocketPC and PocketPC Phone Edition devices.</P>
<BR>

<HR WIDTH=25% COLOR=BLUE>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Amithlon Update ? Yes there is an update!<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (Cue Trumpets!)</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very pleased to announce that we have entered into contracts, 
and yes they are signed, with Bernd Meyer, regarding Amithlon. In 
fact we have been testing a new version in-house for several weeks 
now, and this is a great product. As you may remember I was the first 
person to show Amithlon to the public, at the AmiWest 2001 Show, and 
the reaction was simply amazing from the people there. Since then, we 
are seeing deployment of Amithlon in many new places where Amiga's 
once roamed and seeing new life for Amiga, with Amithlon. Please know 
that we have been working with Bernd for several months so far, and 
we see Amithlon as a great product with a long, robust future for 
both Amiga and Bernd. You can see the press release here.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=25% COLOR=BLUE>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Challenge and the Opportunity!</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now before the naysayers out there begin complaining about this and 
start making rude noises, I want to explain the very real situation 
before us: Let it be known now that Amiga does not make money on the 
following. In fact we will lose money, just as we did on the party 
packs. However it allowed us to show to our board and our investors 
that we should pursue building a new Amiga computer. Now we are at 
that same crossroads again, but in a way that is more complex.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>How many AmigaOne's do we build and order?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to properly plan, budget, and order for the production of the 
AmigaOne. To do that, we need to get a good idea of how many units we 
need to order, build and prepare to support etc. You get the idea.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who tell us to plan for 2,500 to 3,500 units. However 
over 50,000 people downloaded the OS 4.0 screenshots. These were not 
50,000 hits, these were 50,000 different people. Then you have others 
who tell me that we are looking at 10,000 units to prepare for. This 
is great because there are certain economies of scale, economies that 
benefit everyone, that come into play at 10,000 units. You have all 
seen how chip prices work: once you are able to order 10,000 of the 
chip prices you are able to receive better pricing, and then, prices 
start coming down. Everybody benefits.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we find that there are currently over 30,000 subscribers to 
Amiga related magazines. Add to this the fact that we know that there 
are thousands out there who are quietly watching and waiting to learn 
more about the release of the AmigaOne before they respond. Then this 
last week we learned that there was a very large electronics chain in 
Europe who is interested in carrying the line again if there is 
enough interest for these new products.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>So as you can see, this is a real issue before us:</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to come up short on supply for you, the customers, and 
yet it is growing quite difficult to judge how many AmigaOnes we 
should build. You can tell, as we do, that there is a big gap between 
the numbers and we want to make sure that we have the products ready 
when you want them, in sufficient numbers, as you should not have to 
wait. We also do not want to go into a situation of oversupply, 
either. We thought about putting up a survey, but then we know that 
there are some who will try and maliciously effect the results and 
that could, and most likely would, cause us a whole new subset of 
problems relating to the release of the AmigaOne/AmigaOS 4.0.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, we have decided to have some fun with this survey and we 
sincerely think that we have developed a way for everyone to 
participate and will give us some real numbers and an ability to 
better budget and track the real intentions of the community.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">So with no small amount of fanfare, here is what we are going to do:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The AmigaOne,/AmigaOS 4.0 "<I>Free Stuff</I>" Early Promotion<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (catchy isn't
it):</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Here is how it works:</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Customers who are interested in purchasing an AmigaOne/AmigaOS 4.0 
pre-loaded will be able to purchase a $50.00 off coupon for $50.00! 
This way we have a very strong idea regarding how many boards we need 
to produce.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not enough you say! Okay, how about this: For every $50.00 discount 
coupon you will receive a free shirt announcing to everyone that you 
are part of the future. So for $50.00 you get a $50.00 off coupon and 
a free shirt.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still not enough? Okay how about this: When we reach 2,500 orders we 
will have a random drawing for 4 free AmigaOne/AmigaOS 4.0 systems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that there is more of you out there than that so if we reach 
5,000 orders we will give away 10 AmigaOne/AmigaOS 4.0 systems. 
That's riiiiight. 10 people who order their discount coupon and get 
the shirt will get an entire Amiga One/AmigaOS 4.0 system for... 
Free. That's Free. As in Free. No Cost. A former price, dead on the 
bottom of its cage. Or something like that.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some optimists in the office that believe that there are 
10,000 people who are looking to own the first new Amiga system in 
more years than we can count, so if we have 10,000 orders we will 
give away 20 AmigaOne/AmigaOS 4.0 systems and 5 Amiga-enabled cell 
phones!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One last level: If we reach 25,000 orders Amiga will give away 50 
Amiga systems, 15 Amiga Cell Phones, and a trip for 2 to either 
Hawaii or Florida.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK one more - hit 50,000 orders Amiga will give away 100 systems, 100 
Amiga Enabled Cell Phones 3 trips for 2 to either Hawaii or Florida.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over 50,000 and I will come up with something even better, because at 
this level we can show the world what you have been telling us for 
some time, that Amiga is a sleeping giant ready to awaken and take it 
rightful place - being in the lead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Cell phones, and the Amiga systems will be shipped as soon as 
they are available.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you do not win in the drawing, you simply take your coupon and 
wear your shirt into your local Amiga reseller, and you will receive 
$50.00 off when you purchase your new system.<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (Amiga resellers: we 
will be sending you the details on how all of this fun and free stuff 
is going to work).</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now since we need to be placing the orders in the not-too-distant 
future, this promotion will run from today until July 7th, with the 
winners being announced at AmiWest in Sacramento.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So while I know that there are some people who will make rude noises 
and fabricate all kinds of specious claims and others will try and 
use this as a method to attempt driving the community apart even 
more, I hope that the rest of you, the majority of you, can see 
where, with this news and this promotion, we can go together. 
Developers are going to be watching also to see if this is a system 
that they wish to continue developing for, and others who have left 
are going to be watching to see if they want to return to development 
on the Amiga platform. So the stakes are real. But we can face them 
together and succeed.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>AmigaOne and OS 4.0 are the beginning to a new future, and it is real.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To all of you who are thinking of attending AmiWest 2002, in 
Sacramento CA, please come and join in with all of us who will be 
attending, as I will be there and it is going to be great fun 
learning who in the audience may be a winner. It is also one of my 
real rewards of my job to meet you, the members of The Amiga 
Community. You also never know what I am going to announce and we 
could have some real surprises.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Or I just may hang around for the food.</I><FONT COLOR=BLUE> :<FONT COLOR=RED>-D</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=RED>

<FONT COLOR=Aqua><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>It is time to start having some fun!</I></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=Aqua>
