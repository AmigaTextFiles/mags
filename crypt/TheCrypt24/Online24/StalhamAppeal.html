<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Norfolk County Council have given the railway this M&GN station, provided we remove it from the site at Stalham before March 31st 2002, when the site is due to be redeveloped. The railway has accepted the offer and intends to re-erect the station at Holt. We also hope to salvage 200 feet of platform edging from the site, together with the porters office and a timber building.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dismantling of the station is well under way but the major costs will be in the transport of the materials and the rebuilding of the station and porters office at Holt. We will need to replace about a third of the original bricks together with a substantial part of the woodwork. An initial estimate is that we will need about £50,000 to complete the job and restore this typical wayside station to its original condition. The intention is for the station to be entirely gas-lit, as it was originally. The building still has its original fireplaces, cupboards, desks and even an original chair. We already possess the majority of the remaining internal fitments to replicate the original although if you have any item that you would care to donate we would be pleased to consider it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The intention is to have the station on a staggered platform at Holt, adjacent to our 'new' signal box, where it will replicate a typical M&GN country station and complement the rural location in which it is set. This will act as a counterpoint to the pavilion style station at Sheringham.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
