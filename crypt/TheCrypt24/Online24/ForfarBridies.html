<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <I>These are said to have been made by a travelling food seller, Maggie Bridie of Glamis (in the days when the county of Angus was called Forfarshire). They were mentioned by J M Barrie (author of Peter Pan) who was born in Kirriemuir in that county. The original recipe used suet but since that is not always to everyone's taste, you can use butter or margarine.</I></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remove any fat or gristle from the meat and beat with a meat bat or rolling pin. Cut into half-inch (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>1cm</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add the salt/pepper, mustard, chopped onion, suet (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>or butter/margarine</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and stock and mix well.</font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prepare the pastry and divide the pastry and meat mixture 
    into six equal portions. Roll each pastry portion into a circle about six 
    inches in diameter and about quarter of an inch thick and place a portion 
    of the mixture in the centre. Leave an edge of pastry showing all round. Brush 
    the outer edge of half the pastry circle with water and fold over. Crimp the 
    edges together well. The crimped edges should be at the top of each bridie. 
    Make a small slit in the top (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>to let out any steam</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>). 
    Brush a 12 inch square (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>or equivalent area</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) 
    baking tray with oil and place the bridies in this, ensuring that they are 
    not touching.</font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Place in a pre-heated oven at 220F/120C/gas mark 8 for 15 
    minutes then reduce the temperature to 320F/180C/gas mark 4 and cook for another 
    45/55 minutes. They should be golden brown and if they are getting too dark, 
    cover with greaseproof paper (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>vegetable parchment</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>).</font></font></P>
