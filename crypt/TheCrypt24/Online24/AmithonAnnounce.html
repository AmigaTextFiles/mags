<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">June 23, 2002 - Snoqualmie, WA and Melbourne, Australia - Amiga, Inc. 
today announced the cross licensing of Amithlon 2.0. The agreement 
was made with the author and the inspiration behind Amithlon, Bernd 
"Bernie" Meyer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the agreement, Amiga will license Kickstart 3.1 and 
portions of Amiga OS 3.9 to be distributed as part of Amithlon 2.0. 
In turn, Amiga will actively promote and license Amithlon 2.0 to OEM 
customers looking for an Amiga emulator on x86 platforms.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill McEwen, Amiga President and CEO, said,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Bernie has been a good 
friend and partner to Amiga. I first demonstrated a beta version of 
Amithlon almost a year ago at the Sacramento show. Even then the 
quality of the product and its potential were obvious to me. Since 
then it has become a more polished, a clear reflection of the passion 
and skills that Bernie brings to the table.</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I have also been impressed by the moral and ethical integrity that 
Bernie has displayed as he has partnered with Amiga. Too often in the 
past we have had to deal with companies who would like nothing better 
than to split the Amiga community. Bernie has always had the best 
interests of the community at heart and has created a product that we 
can all be truly proud of.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>It is with great pleasure that I finally enter into a deal directly 
with Amiga", said Bernie Meyer. "This new version, to be distributed 
with Amiga's seal of approval, provides customers with a clear 
indication that Amithlon is an actively developed product with great 
prospects. This partnership will allow users of Classic AmigaOS to 
use their applications on modern, affordable hardware.</I>"</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A demo version of Amithlon 2.0 will be available shortly which can be 
downloaded free of charge from the distribution site here. The demo 
version may be upgraded to a fully functional version with a simple 
keyfile, which can be purchased online.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">About Amithlon 2.0</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The goal of the Amithlon project was to make AmigaOS 3.9 run on 
commodity PC hardware. Unlike other approaches to this problem (UAE, 
Fellow), Amithlon provides AmigaOS with complete control over the 
hardware. Hosted on a specially modified linux kernel, Amithlon's CPU 
emulation runs AmigaOS; All access to graphics, sound, networking and 
interface hardware is provided through standard AmigaOS drivers. 
Amithlon 2.0 is distributed as a self-booting CD-ROM image.</P>



<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">About Bernd Meyer:</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bernd Meyer is a freelance software designer with almost 20 years of 
experience in professional software development. He has studied 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Germany and Australia, 
and is currently completing a PhD on Image Modeling at Monash 
University in Melbourne, Australia. In 2000, two of Bernd's hobby 
projects got out of hand. One turned into Glicbawls, a category 
winner in the 2000 International Obfuscated C Code Contest, the other 
into a Just-In-Time compiler for the Amiga emulator UAE, providing it 
with much greater emulation speed. In 2001, Bernd further refined the 
JIT Compiler for inclusion in Amithlon.</P>
