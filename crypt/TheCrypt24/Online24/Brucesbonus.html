<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A water bearer in India had two large pots,  each hung on each end
of a pole,  which he carried across his neck.  One of the pots had
a  crack  in  it,  and while the other pot was perfect and  always
delivered  a  full portion of water at the end of  the  long  walk
from  the  stream to the master's house,  the cracked pot  arrived
only half full.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  a  full  two  years  this went on  daily,   with  the  bearer
delivering only one and a half pots full of water in his  master's
house.   Of  course,    the   perfect   pot   was   proud  of  its
accomplishments,  perfect to the end for which it was  made.   But
the  poor  cracked  pot was ashamed of its own imperfection,   and
miserable  that it was able to accomplish only half  of  which  it
was made to do.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After  two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure,   it
spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream.<FONT COLOR=SILVER>  "<I>I am ashamed of
myself,  and I want to apologize to you.</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Why</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> asked the  bearer?<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>What are you ashamed of?</I>"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">" <I>I have been able,  for these past  two
years,  to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side
causes water to leak out all the way back to your master's  house.
Because  of my flaws,  you have to do all of this work,   and  you
don't get full value from your efforts,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> the pot said.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot,  and in  his
compassion he said, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>As we return to the master's house,  I  want
you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed,  as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice
of  the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of  the
path,  and this cheered it some,  but at the end of the trail,  it
still  felt bad because it had leaked out half its load,   and  so
again it apologized to the bearer for its failure.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  bearer  said  to the pot, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Did you notice  that  there  were
flowers only on your side of the path,  but not on the other pot's
side? That's because I have always known about your flaw,   and  I
took advantage of it.  I planted flower seeds on your side of  the
path,   and every day while we walk back from the stream,   you've
watered  them.   For  two years I have been  able  to  pick  these
beautiful  flowers  to decorate my master's  table.   Without  you
being  just  the way you are,  he would not have  this  beauty  to
grace his house.</I>"</font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three Turtles,  Joe, Steve and Raymond, decided to go on a picnic.
So  Joe  packs  the  picnic basket with beer and sandwiches.   The
trouble is,  the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the Turtles take
10  days  to  get there.  By the time they get there,  everybody's
exhausted.  Joe takes the stuff out of the basket,  one by one. He
takes out the beers and says,   alright,  Steve, gimme the bottle
opener.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  didn't bring the opener, Steve says,   I thought you  packed
it, Joe gets worried.  He turns to Raymond.  Raymond, do you have
the bottle opener?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Naturally,  Raymond doesn't have it,  so the Turtles are stuck  10
miles from home,  with no opener.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Joe & Steve beg Raymond,  to go
back and get the opener,  but Raymond flatly refuses, knowing that
they'll  eat everything by the time he gets back.  After  about  2
hours,  the turtles manage to convince Raymond to go,  swearing on
their  great-grand turtle grave that they won't  touch  the  food.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  Raymond sets off down the road,  slow and steadily.  20  days
pass but no Raymond.  Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled,  but a
promise  is a promise. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After 3 more days without Raymond,   Steve
starts  getting restless.  I NEED FOOD he says with  a  hint  of
dementia in his voice.  NO Joe retorts.  We promised.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  5  more
days  and  still  no sign of Raymond.  Joe realizes  that  Raymond
probably  skipped  out to the café down  the  road,   so  the  two
Turtles weakly lift the lid.  Get a sandwich, open their mouths to
eat.   But  then,  right at that instant,  Raymond pops  out  from
behind a rock,  and says,  I knew it!_.  I'm not f*****g going, a
promise is a promise.</P>

<CENTER>Many many years ago</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I was twenty-three,  </CENTER>
<CENTER>I got married to a widow</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who was pretty as could be.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>This widow had a grown-up daughter</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who had hair of red.</CENTER>
<CENTER>My father fell in love with her,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And soon the two were wed.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>This made my dad my son-in-law</CENTER>
<CENTER>And changed my very life</CENTER>
<CENTER>My daughter was my mother, </CENTER>
<CENTER>For she was my father's wife,</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>To complicate the matters worse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Although it brought me joy,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I soon became the father,</CENTER>
<CENTER>of a bouncing baby boy.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>My little baby then became</CENTER>
<CENTER>A brother-in-law to my dad.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And so became my uncle,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Though it made me very sad.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>For if he was my uncle,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then that also made him brother</CENTER>
<CENTER>To the widows grown-up daughter</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who, of course, was my step-mother.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Father's wife then had a son, </CENTER>
<CENTER>who kept them on the run.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And he became my grandson,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For he was my daughter's son.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>My wife is now my mother's mother</CENTER>
<CENTER>And it makes me blue.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Because, although she's my wife,</CENTER>
<CENTER>She's my grandma too.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>If my wife is my grandmother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then I am her grandchild.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And every time I think of it,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It simple drives me wild.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>For now I have become </CENTER>
<CENTER>The strangest case you ever saw.</CENTER>
<CENTER>As the husband of my grandmother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I am my own grandpa.</CENTER>
