  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"It is now generally accepted that golf did not originate in 
    Scotland. No Scotsman would invent a game in which it was possible to loose 
    a ball." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do  you know why there are 18 holes on a golf course? It's because
that's  how  long it took the Scottish inventor  of  the  game  to
finish his bottle of whisky! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you hear about the Scots golfer who wore a black arm-band.  He
was in mourning for a lost golf ball. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  were watching the final stages of a golf match on TV in  the
club  house when Sandy came in and suggested turning up the  sound
a  bit.   "Sshh!   Not now,  while Colin Montgomery  is  putting!"</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jock was playing golf with the minister of the local kirk.  At the
last hole he missed a six-inch putt which cost him the match.  Out
of  deference to his playing partner,  he said absolutely nothing.
The  minister then observed "That was the most profane  silence  I
have ever heard." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MacTavish was watching a game of golf for the first time  and  was
asked  by  a  friend what he thought of the game.  He replied  "It
looks to me like a harmless little ball chased by men too  old  to
chase anything else.</P></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">England  drew  Scotland in the Euro 2000 play-offs.   The  England
manager,  Kevin Keegan and the England team were having a chat  in
the  dressing room before the match.  "Look guys,  I know  they're
rubbish,"  explains Kev,  "but we have to play them  to  keep  the
football  authorities  happy." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I'll  tell  you  what,"  pipes  up
Michael Owen,  "You guys go down the pub and I'll play them on  my
own,   how does that sound?" "Seems reasonable." replies  Kev  and
the  other  lads,  and with that they all go down  the  Local  and
start  playing pool.  After an hour or so,  Shearer remembers  the
match  and  flicks  on the pub TV to see the scoreline  England  1
(Owen  10min),  Scotland 0. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Confidently,  they resume their  pool
match for the next hour until switching back to the TV,  the final
score reads:  England 1 (Owen 10min),  Scotland 1 (Collins 89min).
"WHAT!!",they  exclaim and run back to  Wembley  where  they  find
Owen  sitting  in the dressing room with his head  in  his  hands.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"What  on earth happened,  Michael?" bellows the manager.   "Sorry
lads,"  Owen  replies,  "Stupid referee sent me off  in  the  11th
minute."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kevin Keegan,  the England football manager and Craig Brown,   the
Scotland  manager were enjoying a quiet beer after  hearing  their
teams  had been drawn together in the Euro 2000 play offs.   Kevin
turns to Craig and asks him his opinion of what may happen. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Well
I  am  hoping that we will squeeze a narrow 1-0 victory at Hampden
with a late goal,  and then hold out for a draw at Wembley to send
us through" says Craig.  "What do you think Kevin?" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Well I reckon
we  will thump the Scots 2-0 at Hampden and then put 10 past  them
at  Wembley.   After  that we'll go on to win  Euro  2000  without
conceding  a  goal,  including the penalty shoot out  against  the
Germans in the semi-finals.  We'll then go on and qualify for  the
World  Cup finals in 2002 where David Beckham will shine  and  our
play  will  be  lauded wherever we go".  "In fact people  will  be
calling  my team not just the greatest ever England team  but  the
greatest team to grace this planet.  I will be knighted, of course
and  David  Beckham  will   become   Captain  for  his  commanding
authority  and  first class example on the pitch".  "We'll  easily
defend  our  European crown in 2004 and then we'll take  the  2006
World Cup,  with the players asking me to go and accept the trophy
from  the Queen as a mark of respect for what I have done for  the
good  of  the  English game and the English nation in particular".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Steady  on!!" says Craig,  "You're a bit optimistic there  Kev!".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Kev looks at Craig and says "Well, you started it pal!"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Scotland football fan,  out walking his dog in a Glasgow street,
came  across an old bottle from which a genie appeared,   offering
the  man  a  wish  (the  usual  way with  bottles  and  genies  in
Glasgow).  Startled,  the fan asks if his dog could win at  Crufts
National  Dog Show.  The genie looks at the flea-bitten,   limping
dog  and  replies  "I'm not a miracle worker.   Think  of  another
wish."  The fan then asks "Can you make Scotland beat  England  3-
0?"  The genie immediately says "Let me have another look at  your
dog." </P></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
