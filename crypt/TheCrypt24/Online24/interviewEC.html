<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Tell us a little about yourself (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>name, age, occupation, interests<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>My name is Emanuele Cesaroni. I am 24, I was born in 1977 in Pisa, here in
Italy, where I live and study Informatics. My studies are going
a bit slowly because I spend too much time in videogame coding, which I hope one
day will become my occupation.</I></P>   


 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">How long have you had Amigas? </P> 

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I have been using Amiga for a lot of years now. I bought one in 1989, it was an
A500. Then I had an A1200, an A4000T of Amiga Technology (<FONT COLOR=SILVER>now sold<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>) and
now an A4000 desktop. </font></font></I></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Do you use any other type of computer?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I use also a PC, an AMD 1000 which I really use very
little with Windows 2000 Professional and really much with Amithlon.</I> </P>


<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Why did you write PuzzleBOBS, especially when the Amiga seems to be less 
 supported now?  </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I remember I was really fascinated seeing videogames running on my
A500.  For a lot of years I remained here to see. One day I kept an assembler
course and I learn to lowlevel program the Amiga. After some
time I began to work on PuzzleBOBS which is now published (<FONT COLOR=SILVER>I have to thank
Olaf Kobnik and Sebastian Brylka for that<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>).</font></font></I></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>When starting I had no hopes to see PuzzleBOBS one day published and
moreover it was already clear I would never sell millions of copies of it. I
started it on Amiga and I finished it on and for the Amiga. This is the only
reason, united to my love for this computer and it's great OS.</I> </P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Do you program for other platforms?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Actually I am working on a portable project. Its name is </i><B>"PDAang"</B><i> a
pang clone for PDAs. The main work is done on AmigaOS because that is the
best coding environment I had ever seen. The rest (<FONT COLOR=SILVER>the porting<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>) will be done on
the destination OS.</font></font></I></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

 
 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">How was PuzzleBOBS created and with what? </P> 

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I began to learn the Amiga hardware on my A1200 using ASM-ONE and writing
small programs which used each one of unique Amiga's hardware pieces for the 
time (<FONT COLOR=SILVER>copper, blitter<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>). So I started PuzzleBOBS after I experienced a lot on
Amiga asm programming. I don't remember from what I started, probably the
first thing I did was a system to draw bobs and detect their collisions.</font></font></I></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">How long did it take to complete?</P>

 <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I spent about 2 years on PuzzleBOBS. I bought an A4000T to do the work faster (<FONT COLOR=SILVER>the 
68040 has really more speed in compiling than the 68020<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>) a
PicassoIV to test the graphic board support and a lot of books about the 680x0 asm 
and the Amiga hardware and OS.</font></font></I></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">What is/was your favourite game and utility for the Amiga?  Why?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I play really few... sometimes  ADOOM. I use always AmigaAMP to listen
MP3s, Yam, IBrowse and Miami for Internet, Ced to write programs, StormC,
ASM-ONE, ASM-PRO and Devpac to compile them. On my WB there are always 
MCP, Amidock and Magic Menu running.</I></P>


 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Have you written any other games/utilities?  Are there any plans to
 release others?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>No, I had never written utilities for the Amiga and my first serious project
is PuzzleBOBS. Actually I am working on PDAng. It runs on Amiga now, but is
meant for PDAs. Probably one day will work on AmigaDe, WindowsCE or
PocketPC. Actually I don't know where, however will, I hope work everywhere.
If you want know more about it, there is a section on my site at</I>:

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Your views on Amiga Inc , and Amiga One?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I hope my next computer will be a really fast PowerPC machine running a
great AmigaOS 4 PPC. With or without Amiga Inc I hope I will be able in
using for coding an environment such as the one I am using now on Amiga, the 
best I have ever seen.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I think Amiga Inc has a lot of merits because they progressed things when they 
bought the Amiga. The AmigaDe seems to be a good product and I will be happy
porting PDAng on it.</I></P>
 
 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Is there any message you would like to convey to other Amiga users?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Yes, only to continue to do things in the same way we are doing now, in the
way we learned using our Amigas. I will contradict Jim Morrison, but I am
sure that this is not</I> "the end".</P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
