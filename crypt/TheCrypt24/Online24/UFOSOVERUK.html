<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A courting couple, a builder's wife and a deckchair attendant all saw
something  strange in the sky on the night of Saturday, May 21, 1977.
All the sightings were near Poole, Dorset.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eighteen year old tax officer Karen Iveson and her boyfriend, 
    apprentice technician Cliff Rowe, nineteen, had just parked their car on a 
    lonely road near Parley Cross when a beam of light struck the back of it.</P>
  <Font color=silver>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>We couldn't see what was causing it, but it scared us 
    a little, so we decided to move on,</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>said Cliff. Back 
    on the road, they saw what had disturbed them. Karen said: <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
    "<I>A large, silvery disc-shaped object hovered over a field, and a silver 
    green cone- like beam of light shone down from the centre of it. We stopped 
    to watch, and it seemed to stay there for ages. Then it suddenly veered off 
    fast and dropped behind some trees, much lower than any plane could go. We 
    both panicked afterwards. It was not like anything I'd ever seen before.</I>"</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Builder's wife Pauline Fall, 31, saw the same thing only 
    miles away as she drove down a dark country lane near the village of Longham. 
    A beam of light fell across the car bonnet four or five times,<FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>as 
    if something was tracking us</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, but at first Pauline could 
    not see where it came from. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>One minute there was nothing 
    in the sky, the next there it was, looking like the underside of a big dinner 
    plate,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> she recalled. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Out of 
    the centre came a silvery white light, narrow at the top and widening into 
    a cone. It was solid light, as if a line had been drawn around it.</I>"</font></font></font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I'm not normally one to panic, but the pit of my stomach 
    went ice-cold. A friend with me was unnerved too.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Pauline 
    kept driving for home to Wimborne, husband John thought from the look of terror 
    on her face that she must have had an accident. Her hands were as cold as 
    ice, and it was an hour before warmth began to creep back into them. Odd things 
    happened to Pauline's car after that night. Petrol consumption shot up, and 
    the engine, perfectly all right when John was at the wheel, inexplicably cut 
    out when Pauline was driving. She refused to take it out alone at night for 
    four months.</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I've done a lot of soul-searching, but I haven't found 
    a logical explanation for what I saw,</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Pauline said. 
    <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>I just wish someone could tell me what it was, where 
    it came from, and what it wants from us.</I>"</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third person to see the craft was deck-chair attendant 
    Richard Morse, 27, who spotted a flickering light behind clouds as he hurried 
    to a bus in Poole. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>I thought it was the Moon, then 
    I saw the Moon in another part of the sky. Just looking at it made me feel 
    weird. It was a flying saucer shape with another shape on top and a beam of 
    white light from its centre to the ground. Time seemed to stand still as I 
    watched, then the thing started to move off, banking very fast, before it 
    disapeared. It wasn't like anything from this planet, I was really glad to 
    hear others had had similar experiances that night, because my friends were 
    starting to think I was mad!</I>"</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along the coast at Parkstone, Dorset, Mrs Ethel Field had 
    a strange encounter in March, 1978, when she left her husband and daughter 
    watching television to bring in washing from her back garden. <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>Suddenly 
    I saw this object in the distance, rising from the sea,</I>" she said. "<I>It 
    ascended and came closer. It was circular with a dome on the top. Beneath 
    it were several lights, shielded by hoods that looked like eyelids. When the 
    lids slid back, there were spotlights lighting the ground.</I></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I was frightened and stunned. It hovered directly above 
    me. The lights were so strong that I put my hands up to screen my eyes. "Then 
    I saw two figures standing in front of an oblong window. They had longish 
    faces and were wearing silver suits and what looked like skull caps. They 
    seemed to be standing at some controls. I felt that some power was holding 
    me where I stood. I waited, shielding my eyes. Then one of the figures turned 
    away from me to look at his companion. The minute he did that, I felt a release 
    and ran petrified to call my husband and daughter. They laughed at me and 
    wouldn't leave the T.V.</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Field spent several sleepless nights worrying about what 
    she had seen. Then red blotches appeared on the hands that the light had hit. 
    Soon her hands were raw, with skin flaking and scaling all over them. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
    "<I>I went to several doctors about it, but only one listened seriously to 
    what I told him,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> she said.</font></font></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salesman Alan Cave, 45, of Taunton, Somerset, remembers the 
    precise moment he became a "<I>time traveller</I>". As he was driving, One 
    October morning in 1981 from Bath to Stroud, his car passed directly beneath 
    a strange, orange, cloud like object in the sky. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>I 
    know it was exactly 11 o'clock</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA> said Alan, because a 
    newsreader announced the headlines on the car radio. But then I glanced at 
    my watch and it said 8 o'clock. My digital pen said 9. Both were right when 
    I set out. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Then the speedo started going back - it 
    was weird. It lost 300 miles, though a mechanic has since told me it was impossible.</I>"</font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alan doesn't believe in flying saucers <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
    "<I>but something very odd occurred in those few seconds and I wouldn't like 
    it to happen again.</I>"</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Flying Saucer Research Bureau later said they 
    investigated several reports of a UFO in the same area. They added that checks 
    on aircraft movement had not provided an explanation.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Weird sightings were reported throughout Britain on New Year's 
    Eve, 1978. Schoolboy Andrew McDonald, 13, claimed he was buzzed by a UFO as 
    he rode his bike home through Runcorn, Cheshire.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I heard a hum like a high pitched engine</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    said Andrew. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>I looked up and there was a big white 
    light with a very bright trail above me. It stayed with me for about ten seconds, 
    then soared up into the sky. I could feel it trying to lift me off the ground.</I>" 
    <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Andrew was so unnerved that he could not cycle any further.</font></font></font></P>
