  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I awoke one morning, it was winter time & I always wore my 
    socks to bed in the winter time due to the dynamic & dangerous risk of frostbite 
    in the northeast of Scotland.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway this particular morning I awoke & there was this dull, 
    numb freezing sensation passing through my entire body, I discovered it was 
    originating from my feet!!! "<FONT COLOR=SILVER><B><I>Oh my God</I></B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" 
    I yelled franticly as the frozen segments of toe cheese cut shards into either 
    side of my toes!. "<FONT COLOR=RED>NOOOOOOOOOOO<FONT COLOR=AQUA>" I screamed, 
    I couldn't believe this was happening to me. What the heck had happened to 
    my socks? I'd ALWAYS been very careful to keep my socks on in bed during the 
    winter time.</font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'd even gone to such lengths as to tying nylon fishing line 
    around my legs over the socks in case the socks somehow got a mad idea like 
    working their own way off!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I struggled to stand ! "<FONT COLOR=RED>OO! EE! AA! OO! ARGH!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>" 
    I groaned as the intense pain shot lightning bolts of pain through my body, 
    more painful than any David Hasselhoff song I'd ever heard!! (<FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Just 
    thinking about D Hasselhoff's music is nearly reducing me to tears!!</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) 
    Anyway on with the adventure- I pulled on my kilt with great difficulty I 
    might add! it had frozen overnight also & the material which is usually a 
    wee bit itchy was now like frozen bloody glass wool !! scraping back & fore 
    across my bare arse peelng skin as it dragged across my bum cheeks.</font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tried sitting down again (<FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>bad idea</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>)) 
    I soon leapt back up in the air screaming out a rather loud "<FONT COLOR=RED>YEEEEEEEEEOWWWWWW<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)" 
    (<FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>you can just picture it can't you??</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>)) 
    It was like I had just plonked my bum on a great blooming porcupine! but that 
    wasn't going to stop me! oh no! & I was soon back on my quest for the missing 
    socks.</font></font></font></font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I eventually worked my way out of the bedroom & into the 
    hallway at the top of the 40ft spiralling staircase. I tripped on something 
    but somehow managed to steady myself & as I glanced round to see what the 
    treacherous object was I stood agahst as something else a wee bit more important 
    caught my eye!!!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A herd of about 500 savage wild haggises stormed out of my 
    parents bedroom & were bounding towards me at a helluva pace! I knew they 
    weren't going to stop for old frosty feet me & I knew I couldn't outrun them, 
    not in the state I was in.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a flash of pure genius I hopped onto the stairway handrail 
    & slid to safety. Not only was I evading being trampled by the ferocious haggises 
    but I was also having fun in the process, "<FONT COLOR=RED>WHEEEEEEEEEEEE<FONT COLOR=AQUA>" 
    I shouted joyfully & I glided down the handrail, albeit it was still a bit 
    sore on my tender & torn buttocks!!.</font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A worse fate awaited me at the bottom of the handrail !! 
    I'd completely forgot about the big solid brass ball my father had fitted 
    at the end of the rail to prevent people getting any ideas about sliding down 
    the railing. Suddenly my joyfull shouts of "<FONT COLOR=RED>WHEEEE<FONT COLOR=AQUA>" 
    became a terrifying girly scream of "<FONT COLOR=RED>AAAYYYYIIIIIIIEEEEAAAAA<FONT COLOR=AQUA>"  
    & the speed I was descending at I didn't stand a Mars bars chance in hell 
    of stopping myself & the G-Force I'd gathered made it impossible for me to 
    jump off, so i just closed my eyes & biting down hard on all my fingers I 
    awaited the fateful end of me! then it  happened.</font></font></font></font></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CLLLLLUUUMMMMMP'<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I was in luck, thankfully 
    my father was a lousy handyman so when I struck the brass ball it was so ill 
    fitted that it flew all the way across the room & '<FONT COLOR=RED>WHAAAP<FONT COLOR=AQUA>' 
    it stotted square bang off my mothers forehead!!!!!! It was safe to assume 
    the old dear wasn't at best too pleased. I landed safely & softly on the last 
    of the charging haggises & escaped a scolding as I had just provided the family 
    with at least two months worth of haggis!!</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My father wasn't so lucky though! my mother blamed his lousy 
    handywork for getting hit by the brass ball & so he got a good crack in the 
    jaw & I mean GOOD. My mum could smack seven pans of poop out of the hardest 
    guys in toon!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the dust had settled & my dad had crawled to the freezer 
    to get a bag of frozen peas to try & get the swellin down, my mum turned to 
    me & said "<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Hey you! ye wee nyaff! whit the hell wis 
    aw that aboot eh ?</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" I explained about the socks & my 
    sore feet & the kilt & the haggises & she gave a wee wry smile out of the 
    corner of her mouth & from behind her back she produced my missing socks!!!!!!</font></font></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I gasped "<FONT COLOR=LIME><I>Hey my Socks !!</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" 
    & carried on rather foolishly with the following tirade of abuse - " <FONT COLOR=LIME><I>ye 
    big daft eejit! ye are! ma feet are bloody frozen & shredded & my bum feels 
    like I've slid sideways on a big bloody razor!" not to mention the life & 
    death situations I had encountered just trying to get down the stairs!</I>"</font></font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My mother swiftly stopped the abuse she was recieving in 
    the best & only way she knew how ! she launched me right across the room with 
    a big lefthook & to make matters just that wee bit worse I only happened to 
    land on my bum were she had left her knitting needles protruding out of the 
    side of the armchair!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But to give her, her due she did make me a great bowl of 
    soup & bought me a brand new pair of those thermal socks which are so tight 
    you can never get them off anyway & a big elephant gun incase I get in the 
    way of anymore haggis herds rampaging!!!!!</P>
