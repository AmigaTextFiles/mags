  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As by now you'll have noticed, we have a completely new look 
    to the Crypt. That's not the only change, though, and we're proud to add to 
    our list of sponsoring companies those of The Srathspey Railway , and The 
    North Norfolk Railway, both of which have kindly granted permission for access 
    and use of their Web-sites. We hope that others will join their example, and 
    help make your magazine totally unique. In the meanwhile, I'll attempt to 
    bring the railways to your computer through a few 'hands on' experiences of 
    a volunteer or two !</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our last Steam Corner, I mentioned taking a look at rolling 
    stock, which I intend on doing now. In their earliest form, passenger coaches 
    differed little from a goods wagon, with the exception of rough wooden seating. 
    As time progressed, carriages developed a roof, as the gentry of the time 
    expressed dissatisfaction with travelling in the open.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This, naturally, gave rise to the need of lighting, which 
    in turn provided it's own problems - oil lamps produced an odour which clung 
    to clothing and unpleasant gases, both of which required removal. The answer 
    to this came in the form of the clerestory roof, where the centre section 
    was raised to faciliate ventilation and the lamps themselves. This format 
    of coachwork rapidly replaced the "stagecoach" as railway travel became more 
    popular, and was extended in length to faciliate further passengers providing 
    the basis for the modern day coaches familiar to all.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gas lamps were later introduced for a better illumination, 
    followed by a real luxury - steam heating, and upholstered seats ! Until then, 
    one had to dress warmly for any distant travel.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the high risk of fire, however, lighting was eventually 
    provided by batteries suspended below the carriages which were charged by 
    dynamos driven by a belt from a bogie axle. It was about this time that the 
    first corridor coaches were designed and built, which set a new standard for 
    construction although the normal coach had separate compartments which were 
    used primarily for suburban services. These allowed people to move from carriage 
    to carriage, and eventually gave rise to a new service - on train catering, 
    all of which are now considered commonplace. Toilets were placed at either 
    end of the carriage, which bore a side corridor giving access to the seating 
    compartments via a sliding door; all panelling being Mahogany veneered.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">These vehicles measured 47' approx. in length. </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">O.V.Bulleid, when all said and done, was extremely radical 
    in his designs. Though they may not have been the most aesthetic, he managed 
    to address some quite daunting problems. A classic example of this is his 
    "double - decker" rolling stock, designed to cope with commuter over - crowding 
    without having to run additional services, by means of twin level compartments. 
    Unfortunately, these proved to be less than popular with the commuters, due 
    in part to the cramped conditions.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Nigel Gresley, however, produced beautiful coaches in 
    teak, with an intention towards quality. As luck has it, there are still a 
    few remaining examples to be found. The interior of some examples would have 
    done many a drawing room proud. The design of these wasn't far dissimilar 
    to the present day, though chairs were the order of the day, compared to the 
    fixed seating of today.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absolute last word in luxury was, of course, the Pullman 
    range. To travel in one was opulence in the extreme. Regretfully, no photos 
    are available.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though the basic designs of coaching were borne of the regional 
    Chief Mechanical Engineers, eventually coach design was standardised, leading 
    to the growth of specialist companies for the construction of a new steel 
    bodied variant, which are a familiar sight today.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The American buck-eye coupling has replaced the chain derived 
    screw-link for the modern rolling stock as a far more durable format, and 
    brakes / suspension have also improved, braking being supplied by disc brakes.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Goods Wagons have also undergone dramatic alterations, having 
    started life as 12 foot un-braked vehicles with wooden superstructure. Though 
    adequate in early days, the necessity for braking became quite apparent, leading 
    to a crude manual device of levers being devised. This still left the problem 
    of braking the train, which was answered in the form of a "brake van". These 
    were heavier (16 tons), and were fitted with a screw-operated brake which 
    the guard would operate as required to alleviate coupling snatch. A set of 
    hand signals would be exchanged between footplate men and guard according 
    to the gradients prevailing, and how the brake should be set.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On initial movement of the train, the slack in the couplings 
    had to be taken up first, otherwise the unfortunate guard would find himself 
    and the brake van accelerating rapidly from a standing start, amongst a stream 
    of highly colourful language !</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This method of retarding train progress wasn't perfect, and 
    as goods trains got heavier, a need for an alternative became apparent. This 
    came in the form of vacuum braking, which was applied by the footplate men. 
    These wagons gave rise to a new terminology - fitted freight, and wagons without 
    vacuum brakes had to be fitted with a through pipe to allow the brakes to 
    work throughout the train.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually, even goods trains became modulated with the arrival 
    of containers and modern handling facilities for large volume work. This was 
    the end of an era which is by most standards now forgotten, where wagons more 
    often than not were laden / unloaded by hand.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These were the heady days of the railways - of fiddle yards, 
      cattle docks, extensive branch lines, locomotives that stirred and stimulated 
      the imagination of all shapes and sizes. Indeed, of small boys in large 
      groups, looking like starlings, sat neatly along a wall with pencils, jotters, 
      sandwiches and the odd camera observing the bustle of the railway before 
      them. The sight and sound of locos straining with a heavy load, of shunting 
      wagons full of goods to their respective trains, and the rush and excitement 
      of a passing express heralded by a shrill whistle.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And what of those men who ran the railways? They who would 
      cheerfully wave from a footplate at those small boys, despite their labours. 
      Those who assisted passengers with heavy luggage, or toiled with permanent 
      way. The unseen masses keeping the equipment in working order, and countless 
      others besides?</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The small boys became all manner of things, but just how 
      many longed to be, at one time, part of the picture of railway enterprise? 
      Isn't it strange that normal working men should have such a profound influence 
      on the casual observer, even more so now that steam locos find their way 
      rarely onto Railtrack metals, only to cause absentees from work, and traffic 
      chaos on their routes?</P>
    <P ALIGN="LEFT">Or perhaps it isn't.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The times change, and along with them, all else changes. 
      The freight train of today is a modulated unit with full disc braking, and 
      no guard required, capable of carrying 1500 tons of goods. No more the sounds 
      of fervent shunting, just the mass transport of items to points of distribution. 
      The Beeching axe, when it fell, cut more than just the unprofitable lines 
      from the railway infrastructure - it caused a cancer which had been growing 
      with the road transport industry, the result being a disjointed rail network 
      which now struggles to warrant it's existence. The effect of this was catastrophic 
      for the railwaymen and their families; enforced redundancies hit every section 
      of railman, and in certain instances created isolated residential areas 
      with little or no employment available, which had been born with the railway 
      in mind. A complete main line disappeared with it, namely the Great Central 
      Railway which various groups have shown interest in.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preservation societies, though manned mainly by volunteers, 
      serve to remind us of those bygone days, and regardless of abilities will 
      welcome anyone with a little spare time on their hands, and wishing to volunteer.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if you don't wish to volunteer, still pay them a visit 
      - the hard work involved in running the railway is always worth it, if it's 
      appreciated, and all income is put to good use. There are still projects 
      for restoration which require financing, despite the voluntary efforts of 
      the societies, and the railways are an important part of Britain's industrial 
      heritage. The difference here is that this museum is a fully operative one, 
      with a lot more to offer the public - an alternative means of transport, 
      in which many people can play a part - even if just selling tickets.</P>
