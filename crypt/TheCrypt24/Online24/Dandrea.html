<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I live in Leavenworth, Kansas, with my wife, Bonnie, and my two sons, Daniel III and Charles. I have also been working as an electronics repair technician for the last few years, and more recently in a computer related job at my local hospital. I don't like working with PCs any more than any other Amiga user, but it pays the bills. Well, due to a serious misunderstanding between me and my boss, I no longer work at the local hospital.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Since November '97 I've been working for H&R Block as a phone technical support specialist for their custom tax software instead of in elecronics repair. It's been a pretty good job, and I've been looking at other positions within the company. Currently, I have an application in for a full time position. Hopefully, it will work out because it means quite a bit more income than what I get now.<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :-)</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well, that application didn't pan out. However, there is 
    the distinct possibility that a supervisory position will open up just after 
    the tax season. Wish me luck!<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :-)</font></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been an Amiga system owner for a few years, now. I 
    started with the A500 Starter Kit back when Tenex offered a discount for sending 
    in a picture of my C64 (which I still have). Since then, I've bought an A3000 
    and a few addons for both the 500 and the 3000. I'm also into programming 
    my Amigas. I've done several small projects for specific tasks, but I have 
    released a couple to Aminet.</P>
