<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Swirling commotion within a magical maze,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Swelling seas within a psychedelic haze,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Places I frequent to me mean so much,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As they've been blessed with my wee girls touch,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Windmills spin out emotion & confusion,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Spin all day in hope of retribution,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Do you forgive for what has been done?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or do you hate & curse the sun,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Follow your heart with too much trust,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Expose too much then confuse with lust,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Can a raindrop become a stream?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Can just one man become a team?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Push yourself past, beyond the average,</CENTER>
<CENTER>to cross the limits, cross the bridge.</CENTER></FONT>

<CENTER>
  Another day, hundreds yet to slay,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  10 more years of false happiness I must portray,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  I try to hang on but the ledge is wearing thin,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  & my fingers are now beginning to lose skin,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Sweeping, swooping starlings high in the sky,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Teach me to see yet they make me sigh,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Each flight a majestic collaboration,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Of sheer beauty & unbridled concentration,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  While we all stress about what must be,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  They fly, born of a life completely carefree,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Is it a good thing or a bad thing?
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Being undecided about almost everything,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  We will pluck a feather & try to fly,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Why do we persist? Why do we try?
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  You can see in dreams & visions what should be real,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Is it subconcious talking or how you really feel?
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  This life has exposed of me several different sides,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  Taken me on some terrifying/terrific rides,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  They say what you see is what you get,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  I'm still not sure who i am or what i've got,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  I'm sure the truth of this life wll one day unfurl,
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  When i open the door to find my two wee girls.
