<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an experiment carried out live on Russian TV in 1992,  a researcher helped 10 
teenagers to summon their 'spirit doubles'.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were asked to send their doubles somewhere, and they all chose the wreck of 
the Komsomolets, which was a nuclear submarine that sunk in the Barents Sea near 
Murmansk.  The teenagers then described what the 'spirit doubles' were seeing 
when moving around the vessel.  Each person drew what they could see, and all 
the pictures were virtually identical.  At the end of the session, the 'spirit doubles' 
were sent back to the moment when the submarine sank.  Again the descriptions of 
the terror of the crew were also similar.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1908, a fiery ball was seen streaking across the Siberian sky before crashing to 
earth near the Tunguska River.  The explosion was heard 800 km away, and 
destroyed a 130km wide area, blasting millions of trees out of the ground.  At the 
centre of the explosion, some trees were left standing, although their branches had 
been stripped.  New trees grew alarmingly fast, and a strange species of insect was 
found.  These phenomenon were identical to the effects created by the first atomic 
bomb explosion on Hiroshima, but the atomic bomb was unknown until 1945.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General opinion at that time was that an Unidentified Flying Object had gone out 
of control and exploded. Scientists now think it may have been a small comet which 
exploded with the force of a 20 megatonne bomb.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For over several hundred years, the Yakut, people from Yakutsk in Siberia, have 
used defrosted mammoth meat over 10,000 years old, to feed their dogs!  
Although supposedly extinct for thousands of years, sub-zero temperatures in this 
area preserved the bodies.  So many of these mammoths were dug from the frozen 
ground that the Yakut people believed the creatures had once lived like moles 
beneath the ground.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Russian hunter followed some oval tracks around 60cm wide, in 1918. He found 
a giant dung-heap and branches broken from trees 3 metres from the ground.  
When he spotted an elephantine giant with massive, curly tusks, he fled.  He had 
not believed anything could be so large.  Recently, the Evenk people, who live in 
the Siberian forests, say they've hunted live 'shaggy elephants'.  Experts say that 
the Evenks' descriptions match those of a mammoth!  In these uninhabited forests 
which cover 8 million square kilometers, any number of mammoths could be living, 
seen only by the Evenks.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ivan the Terrible was born in 1530.  Some historians say that as he was born a bolt 
of lightning split the sky.  His father, Vasily III, died when Ivan was only three, so 
he was made Grand Prince, and his mother ruled Russia on his behalf until she was 
poisoned five years later.  The prince was a violent child who liked killing animals.  
When he finally took power, in 1547, he became the first Russian ruler to be called 
'tsar'.  At the age of 16, he took a beauty called Anastasia Zakharina for his wife.  
She had a steadying influence on the tsar, as until he wed her, he would spend his 
days telling rude jokes and playing tricks at court.  They had 6 children, but in 
1560, Anastasia died.  Ivan was filled with rage and grief, and grew increasing mad 
and violent.  He became suspicious and jealous of everyone and threw hundreds of 
nobles into prison or exile.  Many of these people had been his closest friends.  He 
married a woman who originated from the Caucasius region in the south.  She 
adopted the Christian religion and took the name of Maria, but despite this, she 
encouraged Ivan's violence and together they organised a mass execution in Red 
Square.  Then she died in mysterious circumstances.  Many thought that Ivan killed 
her.  In 1565, Ivan set up the Oprichniki, a feared force of 6000 bodyguards, 
whose job was to track down the enemies of the tsar.  The Oprichniki's saddles for 
their horses bore two emblems - a hunting dog, to symbolise pursuit of enemies, 
and a broom, to symbolise the cleansing of evil, and the sweeping away of his 
enemies.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thousands were captured and killed by the Oprichniki, often brutally.  The force 
played a major part in the Massacre of Novgorod in 1569, torturing over 60,000 
people to death.  The sinister organisation was eventually disbanded in 1572.
Ivan married again, this time to Marfa Saburova-Sobakina, a survivor of the 
Novgorod Massacre, and she died almost immediately after the wedding.  He 
married a further four times during his life-time!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final years saw a change in Ivan.  In 1581, he killed his son and heir, also 
called Ivan, in a fit of temper.  Almost immediately afterwards, he was bitterly 
regretful and descended into a state of terrible despair.  He began to reflect on the 
many evil deeds he carried out during his life-time and started to think he had to 
make amends, in view of his strong Christian beliefs.  He send the names of around 
3000 people who he had had killed to monasteries throughout Russia, and sent 
large amounts of money to the monks, so that they would pray for the victim's 
souls.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1584, Ivan's astrologers predicted he would die on 18th March, and they were 
correct.  He was playing chess with a friend when he died.  He was 53.  No-one 
was quite sure whether his death was destined or simply the result of a badly lived 
life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A strange puzzle emerged over 400 years later, when the body of his third wife was 
dug up - it had not decayed at all!  </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just days before Catherine the Great, express of Russia, died, in 1796, a weird event 
occurred.  Several of her attendants saw her leave her bedroom and head towards 
the Throne Chamber, then minutes later, heard her call for them from her 
bedroom!  Catherine was duly told what had happened, and everyone hurried to 
the Throne Chamber.  There, they all saw a ghostly double of the empress, sitting 
on her throne, bathed in a eerie green light!  When Catherine fainted from shock or 
fright, the phantom vanished.  Could the ghost have been warning of the 
forthcoming death of the empress, just two days later, from a stroke?</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An ex-soldier had always been curious about Russia, and, when he had the 
opportunity, visited Moscow.  Whilst there, whenever he left his hotel, people tried 
to sell him gold, amber jewellery and icons.  He told the most persistent man that 
he'd been a soldier and hadn't come to Moscow to buy anything of that nature.  
The Moskovite then said he might have something that would interest the ex-
soldier, if he would only follow him. </P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Intrigued, the ex-soldier followed the man into a nearby building, down into a tiny,  
dingy basement room littered with boxes and suitcases.  A large, pale man sat at a 
table, counting foreign banknotes.  The two Russians talked in low voices for a 
minute or so, then the large man introduced himself as The Bear. </P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bear then produced a small suitcase from under the table and placed it on the 
table-top.  In broken English, The Bear explained he could offer all the ex-soldier 
needed to make a bomb.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Curious, the ex-soldier edged closer, as the suitcase was opened.  He stepped back 
in horror when he realised the suitcase contained a large slab of radioactive 
uranium.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he raced from the dingy room, he mumbled that there had been a big mistake.
The Bear was found later that week dead from radiation sickness.  No word has 
been heard of either the ex-soldier or the Moskovite, or their present condition!  </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
