<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PuzzleBOBS is<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>obviously</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA> a puzzle game, comparible to "<I>Bust-a-Move</I>", an interesting mix of Tetris and Connect 4.   
A rather demanding game,  it requires a strong hand/eye co-ordination and a quick reaction to stimulae.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The background screens are presented nicely,  and the game is very playable,  
holding a certain "<I>just-once-more</I>" feel about it.  The lettering on the opening 
screen is a little difficult to see,  being blue on a green background,  but despite 
this, configuring to taste was fairly simple.  There are many options, including the 
loading of mods to listen to whilst playing.  Playable with either 1 or two persons, 
either CPU or human, and various methods of control, ie joystick, joypad, mouse or 
keyboard.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an option of screen sizes, from small to large, to enable different set-ups.  
Due to using PAL only, I was limited to the smallest size, but found the screen to 
be acceptable.  I did attempt other sizes, but there was nothing else suitable.  Also 
available is the option to play within a screen in a window on workbench<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>See pic</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.</font></font></P></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The background to each area changes on each level, and these were pleasing, with 
no real distractions during play.  There are two options for changing the 
backgrounds - Flags and Faces.<FONT COLOR=SILVER>  (<I>See screenshots</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.  After trying both, my preference 
was for the Faces, as the ball colours were easier to recognise.  The background 
changes with each level, encouraging you to continue to see the next. </font></font></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are options for setting sound, either from modules within the game, or using 
sound effects instead.  The mods were good, selectable as sequenced or repeated, and did not become irritating.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The game played well under OS3.9, even on a simple, rather stock A1200 from CD 
Rom, although there is an option to install the whole game onto hard-drive if 
wished.  This we like a lot, thus freeing the CD drive for other things, if you're as 
forgetful as I am for removing CDs when finished!  I, however, chose the partial 
installation of key files, due to drive space, and accessed the CD during play.  There 
was no noticable delay in reading data, thus holding up the loading times.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High scores can be saved to hard-drive, along with your chosen configuration, 
ready for the next session.  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>The system used to review was the following:-</CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER>A1200, with Apollo 030/40Mhz plus 16M ram.</CENTER>
<CENTER>CD rom drive x 8</CENTER>
<CENTER>4.3G hard-drive on EIDE99, using 1G partition, with limited space left!</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also two small patches obtainable from <A HREF="http://www.online.de">www.online.de</A>, which are also
easily installed, for those with graphics cards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The game ran well with or without them on this set-up, as they were installed before I knew what they were for!  </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>The game has been tested on many Amigas. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE> The minimum specifications are:-<BR>

A1200, 68020 processor, with OS 3.0 and roms, CD drive, and hard-drive. <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>Recommended set up is:-<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE> 68040/68060 with 16M fast ram, but will also run under UAE and Amithlon, which gives extra speed.
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unusual to see a new title for the Amiga which is suitable for lower-end 
machines, which will run as easily on a broad range of higher specifications too.  Released last year 
in Germany, and retailing at 20 EUR, available from <A HREF="http://www.funtime-world.de">www.funtime-world.de</A>.  Details are
on the website.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Game play was simple to learn, difficult to master, with a sharp increase in difficulty 
after Level 3. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER> The basics of play are as follows:-</CENTER>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A play area is in the centre of the screen, which has a pattern of coloured spheres, 
cutely featuring smiling faces, or representing flags, retained on an upper bar.  At 
the lower end is a swinging fixed pointer which you control holding a coloured 
sphere which you will launch by pressing "fire" at - hopefully - a like coloured 
sphere.  The "next" ball is also shown on screen, allowing an opportunity to plan 
the next move.  Get three or more in a line, and they will disappear, earning you 
points, and clearing a portion of the screen.  As time elapses the upper retaining 
bar descends, reducing your play area.  If your pattern drops below the yellow bar 
at the bottom of the screen, it's "<I>game over</I>".<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>See screenshots</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.   The first few levels are quite easy, 
but after the third, the difficulty increases sharply, as the spheres almost reach the 
lower bar at the beginning.  I have not yet managed to progress past Level 5, but 
that is the challenge.  As the levels progress, bomb spheres are bought into play, 
hopefully to eliminate difficult areas. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our ten-year-old lad has tried playing, and has not yet succeeded in reaching my best 
score, but keeps returning to "<I>have another go</I>".  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Asked for his opinion, he said:</P>
<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"It's okay, hard but okay."</I></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Will he play it again?</P>
<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"What do you think I'm doing?"</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> was the reply, clutching the joystick.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This was the opinion of a very critical Playstation addict, tearing himself away from the latest 
Playstation title.  Good to see the Amiga being battled on, again. </P>
