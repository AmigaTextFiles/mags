<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>We went upon an outing, my missus, lad and me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To a village called Dunchurch, and had K.F.C. for tea.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It started with a five mile walk to tire the youngster out,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But now that it's all over, it's us who're fit for nowt.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>The villagers arranged for us to try their table fair,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And betting folk could wager upon balloons in the air.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A brass band and some dancing girls to make the fellows stare, </CENTER>
<CENTER>Complemented a junior choir,  and birds of prey in t' air.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Tombolas, raffles, fairground rides and stalls of every kind,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And lassies wearing clothing that could make a bloke go blind.</CENTER>
<CENTER>But getting there was hell on earth,  our youngster nearly cried,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As he discovered that today on 'buses we won't ride.</CENTER>

<CENTER>A vow of intent do I make,  here in these lines of verse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To send him off to summer camp, or maybe somewhere worse.</CENTER>
<CENTER>So we can do our sort of thing,  while he get''s on with his,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To achieve balanced harmony,  'twixt peaceful life and bliss.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>We gave up at the end of day,  to making way on foot,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Small change was then collected, and to the journey put.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Up to the thatched 'bus shelter, we wearily did go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And gave in to modern transport, oh what a heavy blow!</CENTER>
