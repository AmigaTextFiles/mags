<blockquote>
<p>In Britain just now, the surfer’s goal is ADSL.</p>
<p>Britain lags far behind the rest of the World today in internet access.</p>
<p>While the rest of the World already has ADSL……..and is moving onto VSDL, BT 
  is ever so slowly trying to persuade Britain to accept its  version of ADSL.</p>
  <p>ADSL:  Asymmetric digital  subscriber line …….   for those who like to know 
    what these things mean.</p>
  <p>ADSL is able to go at up to 40 times faster than a modem  according to BT (2mb/s), 
    but their version, which also uses the rate adaptive system ( means you can 
    get it further away from the exchange but get a slower speed), is rated at 
    512kb/s.</p>
<p>Cable can go much faster……..</p>
<p>However, there are many variants, such as the VSDL mentioned above . VSDL can 
  go between 6mb/s to 25mb/s (again from BT’s own figures).</p>
<p>There is also SDSL, which is Symmetric DSL. The difference here , is that ADSL 
  means it downloads faster than it can upload……BT’s reckons on 512k download 
  256k upload. SDSL is the same both ways……..</p>
<p>Another curious fact…..BT has been playing with SDSL since December 2000.</p>
<p>I also read with interest that they only guarantee a speed of 64k……….</p>
  <p>Now, however much you dislike the fact that 512k/s is not exactly top speed, 
    that is what BT offers you. I believe that for businesses, they will, for 
    a premium, give you faster access. However, this is about home access for 
    the normal surfer.</p>
<p>Right, sounds good, doesn’t it? Surfing at 512k/s instead of using a normal 
  modem which , on a good day, probably connects at 44k………</p>
<p>Ok, lets run with it. </p>
<p>BT has , laughingly shown, a map of Broadband Britain. Lets have a quick look 
  at it……..oops, sorry, they don’t allow you to use it in an article………so here’s 
  the url for it instead!  <a href="http://www.btopenworld.com/broadband/ava61">http://www.btopenworld.com/broadband/ava61</a></p>
<p>Hmmmmmm………doesn’t exactly seem overpopulated in red dots, does it?</p>
<p>In fact, if you stay in Scotland, as I do, you might be very surprised if its 
  actually on offer!!! So much for that.</p>
<p>Ok, I entered my phone number into their search………nope, no ADSL enabled exchange 
  here, mate.</p>
<p>Fast track checker………lets have a go at that. It lets you know when your exchange 
  will be upgraded.</p>
<p>Wait a cotton picking minute, there is no demand in your area for broadband?????</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=525 height=599
src="Images/BB.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
<p>WTF do they mean by that. I ( and everyone else in my area that is a surfer 
  wants it).</p>
<p>A quick call to BT complaints sorted that out.</p>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;Why does your checker say this?&quot;</p></font>
<font color=yellow>
  <p>&quot;There isn’t enough calls going through the exchange to warrant upgrading 
    it. &quot</p></font>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Our computer monitors the usage on the exchange.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Is that data or audio calls?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Have you done a survey of our area?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;We do surveys all the time.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Where are the results?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;What is the sample range of the survey?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot; </p></font>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;Is there a list of exchanges and when they will be upgraded?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;How do I find out?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Can I see the results of the surveys?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Why don’t you enable all exchanges?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;It would not be profitable.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;It won’t be profitable if no-one can use the service that makes the 
    profit?&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=yellow> <p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;If you use the number of people applying, isn’t that a lost cause? 
    Why would anyone apply for a service that doesn’t exist?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p>
  </font>.............<br>
<p>Ah well, a bit pointless ranting at some poor operator who probably can’t get 
  ADSL either………</p>
<p>Wait a minute, BT has done a high speed rollout of ADSL, enabling exchanges 
  so fast, in fact, that over 66% of the population can get it. </p>
<p>Well, blow me down with a feather………</p>
  <p>Lets play with figures as BT have done. There are over 6000 exchanges in Britain. 
    To date, BT has enabled approx.. 1100 of them (from the BT website, circa 
    May 2002)…….. isn’t that more like 18%??</p>
  <p>Nope, BT strikes again……..the exchanges that have been enabled have the largest 
    population densities……so they might be right. The fact that most of the people 
    wanting ADSL are not in high population densities is beside the point.</p>
  <p>Just for those that are a little slow………cable companies have tended to stick 
    to high population densities as well………makes more sense financially to dig 
    up a city with tower blocks than rural roads with 20 people in them……… If 
    there's a cable company in your area, you probably don’t want the BT version………its 
    more expensive, will never reach the speeds that cable can  etc etc.</p>
  <p>Also, even if your exchange has been upgraded, there are still many reasons 
    why you can’t get it. As I said, BT uses a rate adaptive system, this allows 
    them to increase the distance from the exchange that you can get ADSL. ADSL 
    is distance dependant, approx.. 2.5 km is the distance, although the rate 
    adaptive can boost this to 5.5km</p>
<p>So, BT is stretching the truth more than a little…..but then again, what company 
  doesn’t? </p>
<p>Ok, what else is on offer?</p>
<p>Well, BT is currently trialling a satellite system ( as opposed to their normal 
  sat. system). We’ll have to wait and see on this one…… </p>
<p>Their results on this aren’t due for a few months yet, and so far, leaks aren’t 
  exactly inspiring to say the least.</p>
<p>BT’s current satellite system for high speed access cost a monster £899 for 
  installation and another huge gobbit of cash monthly to use.</p>
<p>The new trial system is reputed to be a lot cheaper………wonder why that is?</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, you can download on the trial system at upto 256k/s but need 
  an ordinary phone to upload………so no sharing large files with the boys, eh?</p>
<p>Ok, that appears to be out the window at present………what else?</p>
  <p>Well, there's always that BT stalwart …..Home Highway.</p>
<p>An ISDN connection This gives two 64k/s lines.</p>
<p>Lets have a squint at that…………</p>
<p>Hmmm, I phoned their sales number. They insist it gives you 4 options…..two 
  audio or two digital lines at any time.</p>
<p>Isn’t that two, then?</p>
<p>No, its 4.</p>
<p>But , I can only use 2 at one time?</p>
<p>Yes, but there’s 4. </p>
<p>It got better and better………..but why disturb you with my ranting at another 
  poor BT sod. </p>
  <p>Right, lets boil it down slightly. BT will change your line into a digital 
    line and install another digital line for the princely sum of £74.99. They 
    will also leave you a USB lead ( well, maybe). It says that they don’t provide 
    a lead, but their engineer always leaves you the USB test lead. Why not just 
    say they will leave a lead?????</p>
<p>Just a little quirk here again…… If you do decide to go ISDN, and then they 
  upgrade your exchange……….you will have to pay to get your line changed back 
  if you want ADSL. Also, they may charge you for the remaining duration of your 
  contract for Home Highway……it’s a years minimum, so be very wary !!</p>
<p>Ok, not too bad so far…….</p>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;If I decided to get this……I can surf at 128k?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Oh yes.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Can I get the calls for free?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Erm………….yes. You can get a surftime package, but it only applies to 
    one line……i.e. you can surf at 64k for free. &quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;What about the other line? Isn’t ISDN about surfing at 128k?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;No, its about giving you two lines capable of 64k each.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;So how do I get 128k?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;You channel bond the call . You need an ISP that supports 128k.&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;So you regard a 128k call as two separate calls?&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=yellow> <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=white> <p>&quot;Can I get a package that is all day?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;No, we currently allow Surftime on Home Highway which is 6p.m. to 8a.m. 
    every day and all weekend.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;But haven’t you just cut the hours to 12 that I can use the connection 
    for?&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=yellow> <p>&quot;Yes, but when we specify the times , this means the times that you 
    can connect at and is not the duration.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;So, surftime means you could connect for 14 hours a day but can only 
    use it for 12 hours duration?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Yes. Its to help relieve congestion and makes it fairer for everyone.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;How is it fairer to charge for a service that you can’t use for the 
    times you specify?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Don’t know.&quot;</p></font>
<p>Back to that old chestnut again……………</p>
<p>Ah, they really hang those operators out for everyone to have a kick at…..</p>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Isn’t there a couple of ISP’s that allow you to call in at 128k but 
    don’t charge for two calls?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;Can you tell me who they are, then?&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=yellow> <p>&quot;No, we’re not allowed to mention any other companies.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;What do I pay for Home highway?&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Its very cheap…….we’ve cut the price to £26 a month.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;But that’s only a few pounds less than ADSL?&quot;</p></font>
 <font color=yellow> <p>&quot;Yes, but you don’t get two lines with ADSL.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=white><p>&quot;But you don’t need two lines with ADSL, you can surf and still use 
    the phone with ADSL.&quot;</p></font>
  <font color=yellow><p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  </font>.....................<br>
<p>There you have it………..an afternoon of BT operator baiting.</p>
<p>So, lets recap on my options.</p>
<p>I can’t get ADSL. </p>
<p>There isn’t a cat in Hells chance of a cable company coming my way.</p>
<p>BT shows absolutely no interest in enabling the exchange I use.</p>
<p>I can get ISDN………..and pay through the nose for it.</p>
<p>I can get a satellite system…….and pay even more heavily for it,</p>
<p>or I can move to an area that does get ADSL.</p>
<p>Big choice, eh?</p>
<font color=red><p>Broadband Britain is a myth!!!!!!</p></font>
  <p>Broadband Britain is creating one of the biggest social and economic divides 
    ever!!!!</p>
<p>The next big thing according to all those in the know , will be the growth 
  of tele working (working from home) . how do you do that from a 56k modem???</p>
<p>Since practically all little villages in my neck of the woods are employment 
  black spots……..how do we provide work for them without major travel?</p>
<p>So………lets keep them as employment blackspots, then………</p>
<p>Now why the Hell do I still use BT?</p>
  <p>Simple answer……..there's no alternative in my area……………..however, having 
    said that………..</p>
<p>I’ve just changed my ISP !!!!</p>
<p>Why pay £14.99 for Surftime……then £5.99 to use Btopenworld when I can use another 
  ISP for nowt and get 24/7 access for £12.99.</p>
<p>The Surftime option does include your line rental, but even so……its still cost 
  effective for me to move on.</p>
<p>It may not make BT change its mind about providing a service to my area that 
  it is providing in the rest of the country…………but, God, the satisfaction of 
  telling them to shove it!!!!!</p>
<p>Stuff BT………..as far as I’m concerned, BT should have been sold but the network 
  should NOT have been included. I also see that a number of MP’s are querying 
  this as well……….</p>
<p>Lets hope that BT get the result that’s required because as one of their execs 
  already said……”it could be more than 20 years before some parts get ADSL”.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no intention of helping to support a Company that has no 
  interest in me or my area !!!!!</p>
<p>I can see BT’s point about profits……as anyone who works nowadays knows, the 
  world as we know it, is run by bean counters. If they can’t see an immediate 
  (or very short) return on their money……….it don’t happen.</p>
<p>For BT to upgrade every exchange would cost a fortune. However, without upgrading 
  every exchange, they won’t be able to milk everyone that wants to use ADSL. 
  Note, I didn’t say broadband, because , as you can see from the figures I spouted 
  above, ADSL (the BT variant) isn’t close to real broadband speeds.</p>
<p>And, of course, if BT had started a lot earlier (like Europe did), we would 
  nearly all have ADSL by now.</p>
<p>So, all and all, I’m pretty pissed at BT !!!!</p>
<p>I always thought that with a name like British Telecom, they would provide 
  their services to ALL Britain, not just the parts they thought would generate 
  the quickest profit. </p>
<p>Next time you read about Broadband Britain………remember to look at the facts……not 
  just what BT is praising themselves for, because as far as I can see………they’ve 
  absolutely nothing to be praised for!!!!!!!!</p>
