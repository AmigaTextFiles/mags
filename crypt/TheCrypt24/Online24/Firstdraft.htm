<p>Well, I work for Diageo at the Kilmarnock bottling plant.</p>
<p>This is better known locally as Johnnie Walker’s.</p>
<p>You may have heard of us……….</p>
<p>Ok, down to the details, I’m an electrician at the aforementioned plant.</p>
<p>The plant bottles most of the blended varieties of the Johnnie Walker family. 
  These range from the traditional Red label , Black label and the more expensive 
  brands such as Gold label and Blue label. We also bottle Dimple, J&amp;B Rare, 
  Jet and brands like Premier, Windsor and Buchanans, as well as malts like Cardhu 
  and Johnnie Walker malt.  All in all, a very impressive portfolio of brands, 
  although I haven’t mentioned all that we bottle!!  As you can imagine, we take 
  a lot of care that the product is presented well and the quality is high. </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
  <p>To accomplish this, the plant goes through regular upgrades of machinery to 
    try and ensure that what we bottle is consistently high quality. These upgrades 
    can be of imaging equipment which check the labeling on the bottles and fill 
    heights . Not only does the machinery check the production but as an added 
    failsafe, operators constantly check and recheck for errors. It wouldn’t do 
    for someone to find a flaw with one of our bottles.</p>
<p>So , what exactly do I do all day……..a question echoed by many…..</p>

<p>Part of my job is to try and achieve the continuing performance of the machines 
  electrically . More or less, repair it as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>However, I could also be involved with installing new equipment, modifying  
  or trying to improve existing machinery .</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the job can get involved……..</p>
<p>When I first became an electrician, my main tools were screwdrivers, but, over 
  the years and as equipment has evolved, these have been supplanted by more esoteric 
  tools such as laptop programmers. Nowadays, you’re as likely to see an electrician 
  peering into a monitor as wielding a screwdriver.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Kilmarnock plant is no exception and the current trend for line control 
  systems, laser marking and imaging systems ensure a quality product, so a continual 
  learning process is also involved for everyone. Even the displays have come 
  a long way, with touch screens and GUI’s becoming the norm nowadays . I can 
  remember when it was a plate with lights on it and drawings of machines, although 
  these still exist, they are on the way out as far as new equipment goes.</p>

<p>Panels used to be filled with relays and now are replaced by PLC’s and the 
  likes of profibus  connections. </p>

<p>With computers doubling in speed every couple of years, it is no surprise that 
  industry has turned the same way and the larger processing power means we can 
  now control bottle flow, fill rates etc more exactly and efficiently. </p>
<p>Brute strength and ignorance are giving way to more elegant ways to perform 
  the same tasks.</p>
<p> <center><img width=433 height=325

<p>Where motors used to be direct online contactor units, they  are now controlled 
  using invertor units which can ramp motor speeds and torques in fractions of 
  a second to minimise bottle clash and spill. You wouldn’t want a bottle that 
  was weakened by constant hitting against others. It’s a lot of money to lose 
  if the bottle you purchased with your hard earned cash, either isn’t closed 
  properly or has damaged labels because of these sort of things. So our company 
  tends to buy the best equipment in its field. We feel we are the market leaders, 
  so we try and ensure that we stay that way.</p>
<p>Safety systems have also become a lot more involved, these can include man 
  entry units. This term has, so far, managed to escape the politically correct 
  brigade……displays used to be MMI (man machine interface) and are now HMI. A 
  sign of the times !</p>

<p>Electrical safety has progressed over the years as well with RCD protection 
  the norm, which means that instead of showers of sparks when something goes 
  wrong, you probably only notice because the machine grinds to a halt. As a very 
  small aside, the showers of sparks you see in the likes of American movies etc 
  tend not to happen in Britain, which has an altogether different system of electrical 
  protection on mains supply………….</p>
<p>As you can see from this very brief overview, an awful lot of new things for 
  people to learn to use and understand. It makes for a very varied range of skills 
  and knowledge.</p>

<p>The Kilmarnock plant is a blend of the old and new. Aged whiskey and modern 
  bottling lines. A far cry from the days when people handled the bottles manually 
  and more or less did everything by hand. Pictures of the original plant layout 
  and bottling still exist in displays around the factory, but they really bear 
  no reality nowadays and it seems very strange to see how things were done long 
  ago.</p>
<p>Machines now load the finished product with computers controlling the transfer 
  and amounts of whiskey being held and moved onsite.</p>
<p>Information on the production is keyed into the company network system existing 
  everywhere onsite as well and displayed or called up wherever and whenever required. 
  All product can now be tracked from the very beginning to point of sale. This 
  in itself is a major step forward and has been happening gradually over the 
  years. </p>
<p>There are very few elements of the business nowadays that don’t involve computers 
  to a large degree.</p>

<p>And I help to keep all this moving………well, some of it.</p>
<p>I could extol the virtues for a while yet, but I don’t want to put anyone off 
  by being evangelistic.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, that in the present day, my job is much more involved and thought 
  provoking than in the past. It is certainly much better to work as an electrician 
  nowadays than when I first became one. It’s a lot cleaner , just for one reason.</p>
<p>Of course, it also helps if you work for a Company such as mine</p>
  <p>Now…………..What do you do……….. </p>
