<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Everybody who has a dog calls him Rover or Boy. I call mine Sex. Now Sex has
been embarrassing to me.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">One day I entered Sex in a contest,but before the competition 
    began he ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just standing there,looking 
    around.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I told him that I had planned to have Sex in the contest. He 
    told me I should have sold my own tickets. "But you don't understand" I said,"I 
    had planned to have Sex on T.V." He called me a show off.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">When my husband and I separated we went to court to fight for 
    custody of the dog. I said, "Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married!!"</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Judge said, <FONT COLOR=WHITE>"<I>Me too</I>".</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Then I told him that after I was married that Sex had left me.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">He said<FONT COLOR=WHITE> "<I>Me too</I>".</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Last night Sex ran off again.I spent hours looking around town 
    for him.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A cop came over to me and asked me what I was doing in the alley 
    at 4 O'clock in the morning. I said looking for Sex.</P>
