<FONT COLOR=SILVER><BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>How strange you humans are!  You seek freedom, yet still live your
lives  in  boxes.   You leave these boxes to  enter  mobile  steel
boxes,   which take you to even bigger boxes.  Some of  these  are
static,  and some are not.  After a while,  you leave the communal
box,   re-enter the small mobile,  and return to your own  private
box.  We don't understand this.  In the time you take to travel  a
few hectons,  we have travelled to another galaxy.  We notice  you
have things called aircraft,  but cannot understand how they  stay
aloft  -  too  slow  for self-support,  and  you  don't  have  our
technology, yet. Thankfully.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>You've  even tried space exploration,  well,  if you can  call  it
that.   The  whole  idea  is  to make  your  craft  re-usable  and
efficient,  a workplace too.  You create a vast amount  of  waste,
although  you have improved since my last visit and  have  started
to think a little about re-cycling.  You have taken a long time to
realise that most things can be re-cycled - luckily,  most of  the
simpler things do it for you - like water, food, and air.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Earth  language is most confusing,  along with your token  system.
On  our  planet,   we all speak the same language,   whereas  your
language  changes noticeably from area to area.  Then  you  wonder
why  we  haven't  made spoken contact.  You also send  your  armed
patrols to greet us, and try to use their puny weapons on us. This
is  no threat - we just move out of the way.  A fine reception for
those that come in peace.  The one concept where you most fail, is
the  inability to love one another.  Until you can  truly  respect
each  other,  there will never be harmony and peace.  I still  see
warfare  and  inequality between people.  And you call  yourselves
civilised?  Well,   I'm off to the Gamma 4 quadrant  for  a  well-
earned  holiday,   and  to report sadly  that  there  still  isn't
intelligent  life on Earth yet.  Maybe,  one day,  we'll  actually
talk  -  there's a lot you could learn from us -  if  you  survive
that long!</I></P></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
