The great thing about being the webmaster for the magazine is I get to read the articles before everyone else.
 And for this issue everyone has worked extremely hard making another wonderous </font><font color=red>Crypt.</font><p>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Reading through the articles about Aliens I find myself still 
  unsure if they exist or not, but I must admit there is some strong evidence 
  to think they do exist. Have a read and see what you think. Then drop us an 
  E-mail on what you think and we`ll print out the replies in the next issue. 
  <p> Another article that caught my eye is from our resident PC Editor, Ian Urie, 
    on his continual fight with BT trying to get Broadband in his area of the 
    woods. I`m lucky where I live as I`m in an area where we can get the super 
    fast connection, but many throughout the country want Broadband, but because 
	of where they live they can`t get it for love nor money. Surely something 
	should be done to force BT to provide what a growing majority of the populous
	want?</font><p>

	If an article catches your eye, or there`s something that you disagree with in
	the </font><font color=red>Crypt</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> then write to us and let us know,
	we like your mails and will reply to all of them.
