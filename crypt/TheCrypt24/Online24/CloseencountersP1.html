<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  a  wet  and  windy night in November 1980 Mario Luisi was walking
through  sodden  meadows  by  a  river  outside  his  home village of
Burneside  in the English Lake District.  In the darkness he saw what
he  took  to  be  a  cow.   Then  he  thought  it  might be a crudely
constructed  sheep  shelter.   But  then  he  saw that the object was
hovering  1 metre above the ground and looked like nothing so much as
a distorted aeroplane.  It was about the size of a helicopter and had
what  seemed  to  be  a  tailplane,  but  no  wings.  It bore strange
symbols, the like of which Luisi had never seen before.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he stared at the weird object glinting in the beam of his 
    lantern, he became aware of a squelching sound. He realised that someone was 
    approaching him across the soggy ground and turned the beam of the lantern 
    in the direction of the sound. He saw two figures, apparently human, about 
    2 metres away, beside an old oak tree. They were wearing dark, skin- tight 
    suits. At that instant one of them, apparently female, raised a small pencil-shaped 
    object in her hand. A bright light shot out from it, striking the face of 
    Luisi's lantern. The glass front shattered and as Luisi watched, the metal 
    reflector became warped and twisted.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remainder of Mario Luisi's encounter took place by the 
    light from a paper mill on the other side of the river. The female figure 
    spoke to him, telling him that she and her companion meant no harm and had 
    come to the Earth in peace. (Presumably, then, their "attack" was a defensive 
    measure against what they had taken to be a weapon - the lantern.)</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Luisi was told that he must not reveal the strange symbols 
    on the ship, nor those on the lapel badges worn by both figures. He could 
    only stare, his legs shaking, as the two beings, who were fair-skinned, entered 
    their craft by means of a ladder that descended from it. Presently the object 
    shot upwards, leaving a glow in the sky.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The encounter left Mario Luisi with a memory that would change 
    his outlook on life. For him, at least, there was no longer any doubt - no 
    need to question whether the human race is alone in the Universe. He "knew" 
    that we are not.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem has fascinated mankind ever since it was realised, 
    in the 16th century, that the planets are other worlds and the stars are other 
    suns, possibly possessing their own planets. The human race seems to abhor 
    the idea of being alone in an immeasurably vast Universe. This sentiment was 
    exploited to great effect by Steven Spielberg's epic film "Close encounters 
    of the third kind", which was released in 1977. Spielberg brought the idea 
    vividly to life. He himself is keenly interested in UFO's and is associated 
    with the Centre for UFO Studies, in Evanston, Illinois, USA, which is run 
    by J. Allen Hynek.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most fantastic type of evidence on the question consists 
    of the numerous accounts of the close encounters of the forth kind - of which 
    Mario Luisi's is one. These go beyond close encounters of the third kind, 
    in which aliens are merely seen: witnesses claim to have met, talked to, travelled 
    in company with, or even been abducted by creatures not of this world.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four varieties of close encounters of the fourth kind have 
    been distinguished. Mario Luisi's experience is typical of type A, which embraces 
    straightforward encounters where the witness fully remembers what took place. 
    There are no memory blocks, no intervals of time that the subject is unable 
    to recall, no obvious reason to doubt that the experience was of something 
    completely real. It is just as much a part of the sequence of events as getting 
    up that morning.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These type A events are the most sober evidence for the reality 
    of aliens. And they are by no means rare. Although close encounters of the 
    fourth kind as a whole make up no more than about 1 or 2 per cent of the total 
    number of UFO reports made each year, this still amounts to many hundreds 
    of cases since the Second World War. They come from almost every country and 
    all social groups. And over half of these encounters are of type A. It is 
    thought that they could be even more common than the figures suggest, for 
    there is evidence that witnesses are unwilling to talk about this kind of 
    experience.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seeing an unidentified light in the sky is almost commonplace 
    these days and people are more willing to report it than they once were. But 
    talking to a creature from another world is, for many people, something to 
    keep quiet about. This is unfortunate, since it means that researchers are 
    unsure of the true scale of the phenomenon. But the information supplied by 
    courageous witnesses is sufficient to indicate that something truly extraordinary 
    is going on.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But serious problems arise, even in these seemingly rational 
    type A accounts. The Mario Luisi case is typical in this respect. He volunteered 
    the lantern for scientific study. The results of two independent analyses 
    were identical: in the opinion of experts the damage was done by ordinary 
    means, probably by a blow- torch. Had Luisi concocted his story and damaged 
    the lantern himself, it would have been odd for him to be so cooperative. 
    And it is not possible to disprove his claim, by which he stands, that the 
    lantern was struck by a beam from an alien weapon. Certain other points in 
    Mario Luisi's story support his claims. But support is not proof: and we never 
    do get proof in cases of close encounters of the fourth kind that a witness 
    is not Iying.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty, of course, is that even if the witness is 
    telling the truth, there is no guarantee that his alien contacts are not using 
    materials and technology indistinguishable from our own. Nevertheless, when 
    what is presented as evidence could perfectly well be of earthly origin, one 
    is bound to become suspicious.</P>

  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of researchers have been conducting studies into 
    close encounters of the fourth kind, analysing the features of the stories 
    in detail. Type A cases stand out from the other reports in many ways. They 
    tend to occur outside the usual surroundings of the witness - in the open, 
    perhaps in a field and so on. They happen at any time of the day, even though 
    UFO's are predominantly nocturnal. The average number of witnesses per case 
    is well below the average for all UFO cases but close to the average for all 
    close encounters of the fourth kind.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Photographs purporting to show alien beings are, disappointingly, 
    rare. This seems highly significant when it is remembered that UFO photographs 
    are very numerous. If the number of pictures of aliens where of the same proportion 
    as the number pof contact cases, 1 or 2 percent then we would have a great 
    deal of material to work on. In fact there are no more than two or three photographs 
    and none that, beyond reasonable doubt, link an alien being with a UFO.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet we cannot complacently dismiss the phenomenon as unreal. 
    For there are cases in which several witnesses see aliens. One example occurred 
    on 3rd March 1980, at Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Two teenage children, Vivian 
    and Jose Rodriguez, were woken at 3.3O a.m. by a barking dog. They looked 
    through the window of their farm to see five strange creatures, with pointed 
    ears and webbed feet, wearing tight-fitting clothes. The aliens seemed interested 
    in the family's chickens. No UFO was observed by the children.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next day it was discovered that at the same time of night 
    two men nearby had seen the same creatures. The witnesses had been sleeping 
    in a parked car, resting during a long journey. They had woken up and had 
    seen a large domed object on the ground. Beings fitting the description given 
    by the children had emerged from the object and headed in the direction of 
    the Rodriguez farm.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such a story, if true, is very hard to explain as anything 
    other than a real, physical event. The apparent subjectivity of these type 
    A cases should not be over-stressed.</P>

  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second group of contact cases, type B is quite different. 
    The aliens involved are often called "bedroom visitors" because as many of 
    them make their appearance in the bedroom; the witnesses usually claim to 
    have experienced the encounter while wide awake. These encounters have a good 
    deal in common with ghost sightings that happen in the bedroom.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What distinguishes these events from type A cases is that 
    they possess obvious distortions of reality - parts of the sequence of events 
    are completely forgotten, there are jumps in the story from one scene of action 
    to another, as in a film or a dream. The reality of the events is much more 
    doubtful than that of the type A cases.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, on 5th January 1980 a 33- year-old house-painter 
    awoke at 5 a.m. in his bedroom at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in southern England. 
    He saw a glowing green figure, 2.1 metres tall, at the foot of his bed. It 
    looked more like a projected image than a solid figure. The alien told the 
    witness that the people to whom he belonged regularly shipped human beings 
    off to other worlds in order to colonise them. When a planet became overcrowded 
    they started a war in order to reduce the population. This behaviour seemed 
    to be in conflict with other efforts that they were making to protect us: 
    it seemed that our planet was liable to split in half and the alien visitors 
    were desperately trying to plug the cracks by injecting a liquid cement from 
    their remotely controlled space vehicles!</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, the witness's wife was in bed beside him all 
    this time, yet she did not awaken, nor did it occur to him to disturb her. 
    It seems most unlikely that anyone would make up such a story and expect anyone 
    to believe it. It is not necessary to doubt the witness's sincerity - but 
    neither is it necessary to take this weird story at all seriously. Type B 
    cases are rarer than type A - they form about a quarter of all contact reports. 
    They are far more subjective, since they are almost exclusively single-witness 
    encounters. By far the majority of them occur in the home or its immediate 
    surroundings - fully two thirds of the cases occur in the bedroom. And most 
    of them happen in the early hours of the morning.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This seems to suggest that the two types of contact are different 
    in nature: type A sound like real contacts with something physical type B 
    sound like some kind of hallucination. It seems a plausible working hypothesis, 
    though there are cases in which it is hard to decide whether a case belongs 
    to type A or type B.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third category of contact report, type C, involves an 
    experience that is not immediately remembered. The experience of an English 
    family, the Days, will illustrate how disturbing this can be.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One evening in October 1974, John and Sue Day were driving 
    to their home at Aveley, in Essex. They had been visiting relatives and were 
    now hurrying, hoping to catch a late night television play. Their three children 
    were with them and fell asleep during the journey. Then their parents saw 
    a blue light pacing the car. They watched it for some time but were unable 
    to identify what it could be.</P>
  P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the light disappeared - and the car turned a corner and 
  ran into a well-defined bank of eerie green mist. The Days were in the mist 
  for only a few seconds, but the car radio sparked and crackled. John instantly 
  yanked out its wires to prevent a fire hazard. After recovering their composure 
  the family drove the few hundred yards to their home. 
  <p></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they got home they switched on their television set, 
    but the screen remained blank. It was two hours later than they had thought 
    and the station had closed down. Someone or something had stolen a piece of 
    their lives.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The family were naturally perturbed by this mysterious time 
    lapse. Over the next few months they had several dreams about it fleeting 
    visions of weird faces, occasional strange impulses to refrain from eating 
    meat or drinking alcohol. Eventually two UFO investigators, Andy Collin's 
    and Barry King, heard of the event. They brought in the help of a medical 
    hypnotist - Leonard Wilder, a London dentist. The Days underwent regression 
    hypnosis in the hope of retrieving memories of that missing time. And the 
    memories came.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under hypnosis John and Sue told stories that were in close 
    agreement. However, there were some differences, and they did indeed claim 
    to have been separated for much of the "missing" time. The children also seemed 
    to recall the experience in subsequent dreams.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A UFO had landed and the family had been taken on board. 
    They were given medical examinations and shown around the craft. They were 
    informed about its propulsion system and the way of life and intentions of 
    the alien visitors. Eventually they were returned to their car by a process 
    akin to astral projection and they continued their journey. But their lives 
    could never be the same again.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To those who interviewed them, the Day family seemed a group 
    of pleasant and sincere people who had never tried to force their story onto 
    anyone, or to make money from it. Something quite certainly happened to them 
    that night... but what?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In type C contacts, something blocks the witnesses' memory. 
    Occasionally recall of the "missing" events is triggered by normal events. 
    Not infrequently the subject has dreams that hint at what took place during 
    the missing minutes, hours - or even, in a very few instances, days. But the 
    most common means by which the floodgates of memory are opened is regression 
    hypnosis.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Type C abductions are remarkably consistent. One in five stories 
    of alien contact involves amnesia and alleged abduction.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Type C cases are more subjective than ordinary UFO sightings, 
    since they tend to involve fewer witnesses; but they have a higher number 
    of witnesses per case than type B or, surprisingly, type A cases. The aliens 
    involved usually resemble human beings and are usually the normal human size, 
    or larger; there are very few entities of small stature, unlike those featured 
    in type A cases. The most common time for type C incidents to occur is between 
    about 10 p.m. and midnight. And a very large proportion of them involve young 
    couples driving cars along quiet roads (quite often carrying children with 
    them). It is also common for one or more of the witnesses to have a history 
    of strange experiences - witnessing ghosts or poltergeists, for example. And 
    the way of life of the subjects may undergo drastic changes, even before the 
    memory of an apparent abduction is at last retrieved and the cause of the 
    changes made apparent.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth group of close encounters of the fourth kind comprises 
    very few cases. It consists of those experiences in which the encounter does 
    not seem to involve physical contact: communication is by means of telepathy, 
    automatic writing, or something of the kind. We shall not these in this article. 
    We shall try instead to see whether among all the details of the cases of 
    types A, B and C there is a clue to the reasons why such experiences occur.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hypnosis is still a controversial subject. Its significance 
    becomes even more obscure when it is used to recover the blocked memories 
    of a witness in a UFO contact case. Experts dispute the origin of the images 
    that come to the mind of such a person in a hypnotic trance. Is the subject's 
    psychic potential boosted? Does he become able to dredge information from 
    the collective unconscious, potentially becoming aware of everything that 
    has ever happened anywhere at all? Or is the abduction memory that comes to 
    the witness simply a respinning by his mind of a story once read and now forgotten 
    - the re-creation of a modern myth?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For certainly alien beings and their spacecraft have attained 
    the commanding status of myths of our time, whatever the reality that lies 
    behind them. Or does regression hypnosis simply free the memory so that the 
    barriers to recall can be hurdled and the "missing" period relived? There 
    is a very difficult problem of assessment whenever a witness in a type C case 
    retrieves a "memory". What is its true significance?</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A case similar to that of the Day family occurred in June 
    1978, again in England. A young couple, their children and another adult were 
    involved. The alleged abduction took place during a car journey in Oxfordshire; 
    again there were many similarities with other abduction stories: for example, 
    three- dimensional ("holographic") shows were displayed to the witnesses. 
    But the story as a whole was quite unlike any of the 100 or more other type 
    C cases that have been documented by UFOlogists.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aliens looked humanoid - indeed, very like those seen 
    by John and Sue Day - and they told of the origin of their race on Earth and 
    their emigration to the planet Janos. Now a horrific natural disaster had 
    precipitated their flight back to Earth. They wish to move in with us... a 
    million or so refugees from this cosmic catastrophe. What is interesting about 
    this case is partly, how it resembles in outline other incidents, such as 
    the Day case (which had received publicity in the British press). But more 
    importantly, the interests, attitudes and manner of questioning of the investigators 
    found their way into the story that was told - as if the hypnotised witnesses 
    were picking up "cues" from the investigators and fitting them into their 
    accounts as they told them.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is rather like the game in which you are given a series 
    of objects - say, a book, a pen, a candlestick and a toy balloon - and are 
    asked to use your imagination to weave a story in which they all figure.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This curious problem is further illustrated by the experiences 
    of young Gaynor Sunderland, from Oakenholt in North Wales. She and her family 
    had many weird encounters, including contacts with aliens who, again, looked 
    rather like the ones met by others who reported similar experiences.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On one occasion Gaynor was having trouble sleeping because 
    she kept seeing two aliens - one male, one female. (Later she found that they 
    were named Pars and Arna.) I was then investigating the case and I suggested 
    to her mother, Marion Sunderland, that she could tell Gaynor a white lie. 
    Gaynor was told: "If you put a loaded camera in the bedroom the aliens will 
    not come because they do not like having their pictures taken." A couple of 
    nights later Gaynor was allegedly abducted to another world and taken on a 
    tour of a city there by Arna and Pars. She was told that she was not really 
    there: the experience was in her subconscious mind, a kind of dream. Yet the 
    aliens maintained: "We did not come to you because of the camera."</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is highly paradoxical that an alien entity should first 
    admit to being a product of the unconscious mind and then claim to dislike 
    being photographed. It seems that Gaynor's mind somehow wove the idea concerning 
    the camera into her experience of the trip to another world. But she remained 
    convinced of the reality of her experience and said it was far more vivid 
    than a typical dream.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">We sometimes find that the initial stimulus for an abduction 
    experience is an event that can be explained straightforwardly.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This casts doubt on the remainder of the account provided 
    by the witnesses. One of the most famous type C cases involved an American 
    couple, Betty and Barney Hill, who were returning from holiday across the 
    mountains of New England during September 1961. A mysterious "craft" followed 
    them and then came down nearby; Barney Hill watched it through binoculars 
    before driving away in panic. All the classic features of such incidents were 
    there: a psychic witness (Betty had experienced many types of weird phenomena 
    throughout her life); a blank in their memory of events; strange dreams afterwards; 
    and finally, under hypnosis, memories of abduction and medical examination 
    on board the UFO. Yet it has been argued very convincingly that the light 
    in the sky that marked the beginning of the whole train of events was nothing 
    more than the planet Jupiter.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This does not in itself tell us anything about the reality 
    of the experience; witnesses often link completely unassociated events in 
    their recollections of some incident, simply because those events happened 
    to occur at roughly the same time. But it is just part of the process by which 
    human beings misperceive events, distort their memories of them and come to 
    mistaken conclusions about them later.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should bear this complex process of interpretation and 
    misinterpretation in mind as we consider the appearance presented by aliens 
    and their craft in contact reports. What should we expect extra-terrestrial 
    life forms to look like? This is a very hard question to answer, since our 
    only examples of life come from one planet - the Earth. Yet when we see the 
    amazing range of species hosted by our environment and recognise that mankind 
    is just a link in a long evolutionary chain in which an even greater diversity 
    of forms has existed, we find little reason to suppose that alien beings should 
    look like us.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Admittedly the humanoid form is well- adapted to a wide range 
    of environments on the Earth's surface, and it may well be common on other 
    Earth-like planets throughout the Galaxy; but the human form is presumably 
    not a necessary condition for dominance. Since other worlds would have a great 
    range of habitats, and local conditions would vary greatly, life there would 
    undoubtedly be equally diverse.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carl Sagan, the eminent astronomer. has even proposed possible 
    life forms capable of surviving on Jupiter: such as living balloons in the 
    oceans of water that may exist in the warm depths of the planet, below the 
    perpetually frozen clouds that we see.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last thing we would expect is a menagerie of alien races 
    looking more or less like us - and yet, according to contactee's, this is 
    precisely what we do find.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only 7 per cent of contact cases involve creatures that are 
    not humanoid. Such beings as the giant white maggots that crawled across a 
    road in Yssandon, France, in 1960, during a UF0 sighting, are rare. There 
    are three distinct groupings among the humanoids that form the bulk of the 
    data:</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">SMALL - Below 1.5 metres tall and usually about 1 metre);</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">MEDIUM - 1.5 to 1.8 metres); and</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">LARGE - Up to about 2.1 to 2.4 metres.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In type C (bedroom visitors) encounters, the entities witnessed 
    are fairly normal, with a slight tendency to larger sizes. In no fewer than 
    41 per cent of type A cases, on the other hand, the entities seen are small. 
    There are other fairly common features, such as large eyes, fair skins and 
    angular features. But other factors, such as clothes, show great diversity.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One might not consider this to be a problem. After all, people 
    on Earth wear a wide variety of clothes and human beings of different ages, 
    races and sexes are extraordinarily diverse. But the difficulty with contact 
    cases is more fundamental: the aliens as described are just too much like 
    us. They usually speak the language of the contactee, whether it be English 
    or Serbo-Croat. Nearly always they speak it faultlessly and without any noticeable 
    accent. This means, of course, that they are speaking in the same accent as 
    the contactee himself (a vital, but usually overlooked, point).</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their fashions, too, are far too similar to those on Earth. 
    It seems nonsensical to imagine that an alien from a planet light years away 
    should wear a cloak buttoned at the neck and sport a badge on the breast of 
    a jumpsuit-style garment. Yet this is what contactee's claim and it is all 
    too reminiscent of the limited imaginations (or wardrobe budgets) of science-fiction 
    film-makers.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a witness asks for the origins of an alien, he is almost 
    invariably told that the entity comes from space. In the earliest contacts 
    the aliens home planets belonged to our solar system - Mars, Venus, Saturn 
    and so on. Now we know that humanoid life on these worlds is impossible and 
    present-day contactee's are told the aliens come from planets circling distant 
    stars. As yet, of course, science knows little about the very existence of 
    such planets, let alone their suitability for life.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is it like inside an alien craft? The witnesses answers 
    to this question also raise grave questions about the nature of their experience. 
    Imagine a Stone Age man transported through time and taken onto the flight 
    deck of a Concorde airliner. The instruments and controls would be quite incomprehensible 
    to him. How could he possibly describe what he saw in any intelligible way, 
    knowing nothing of the purpose and importance of what he was seeing? This 
    would be the predicament of any Earth-dweller taken inside an alien starship.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet these amazingly advanced visitors, who traverse interstellar 
    space at a whim, apparently do so in spaceships that would not look out of 
    place in one of our engineering museums. They use levers and valves, wires 
    and old- fashioned bulky computers. They have flashing lights, in the manner 
    of Star Trek and Doctor Who. They are slow in catching up with our primitive 
    technology. They are just getting round to using lasers and holograms (which 
    they did not have before we did) and they do not as yet have the liquid crystal 
    displays that are now standard on our watches and calculators. What is more, 
    their spaceships are always breaking down... Not infrequently the aliens enlist 
    the help of Earth-dwellers to sort out their problems. Once they asked an 
    eight-year-old boy to fix their propulsion unit. Evidently the origin of all 
    this is not the face-value explanation beloved of the alien spacecraft theorists.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the contactee's are aboard, the aliens usually carry 
    out a medical examination. Taking blood samples is an integral part of this. 
    The Irish UFOlogist John Hind points out that the doctor is the symbol of 
    authority who plays the greatest role in the lives of many people. There seem 
    to be significant resemblances between these examinations by aliens and the 
    contactee's previous experience of medical treatment. One Canadian abduction 
    appeared to feature a replay of an appendicectomy that the witness had earlier 
    undergone.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The memory blocks in type C cases present an interesting 
    problem. If aliens can suppress memories, why do they do it in such an ineffective 
    way? The memories usually filter through spontaneously and are easily retrievable 
    in full by hypnosis. Why block them at all? Unless the memory block in fact 
    works successfully in most cases - implying that there are thousands of people 
    who are abducted and have no inkling of the fact afterwards.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the reason for these memory blocks, the lapse of 
    time between the original occurrence and its subsequent recall severely impedes 
    the investigation of the case. And this, of course, may be the most significant 
    function that the memory loss serves.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When aliens give us messages they are almost always of one 
    form: warnings about the future of the Earth, with hints of nuclear war and 
    impending doom. If only we were sometimes given something startling and original 
    - a new scientific theory, a helpful invention, a cure for cancer. But no; 
    we are told that, because of our nuclear tests, "the balance of the Universe 
    is being disturbed".</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occasionally there is some light relief. In spring 1978 a 
    Red Army officer was abducted by the shores of the Pyrogovskoye Lake in Russia. 
    Once he had got used to his humanoid hosts, he suggested they ought to toast 
    this cross-cultural contact with a suitable drink. They did not understand. 
    So he sketched out the chemical structure of alcohol and the aliens retired 
    and immediately made some. "How is it that such a highly developed civilisation 
    does not use something like this?" the Russian asked. "Maybe if we had used 
    it we would not be so highly developed," was the response.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A teetotal message in the form of a joke makes a welcome change 
    from the usual run of communications from other worlds.</P>
