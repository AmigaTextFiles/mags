<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Snoqualmie, April 15th 2002</I> - Computer City is pleased to announce that they have obtained a licence from Inutilis software that will enable them to bring the Inga gaming system to all Amiga platforms.</P>

<Font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Inga gaming system provides everything required by developers for the creation of classic graphical adventure games. It includes both a complete set of development tools and a run time engine. An easy to learn and highly flexible scripting language makes it possible for anyone, even non programmers to create varied and complex adventure games whilst the the intuitive interface provides all the control and interaction that the game player could want.</P>

<Font color=silver><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "<I>Computer City has been working closely with Amiga for many years, and with the introduction of Amiga Anywhere, we saw a huge opportunity." said Ron van Herk of Computer City. "Everyone loves adventure games but no one likes having their favourite adventure stuck on only one platform. With Inga running on Amiga Anywhere, the adventure is just beginning.</I>"</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "<I>It is a pleasure to welcome Inga to the Amiga platforms</I>."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    said Bill McEwen, CEO and chairman of Amiga, Inc.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>As 
    Amiga Anywhere spreads from Handhelds to Set Top Boxes Personal Computers 
    and beyond, customers will demand to play their games on any digital device. 
    This announcement means that they won't be disappointed.</I>"</font></font></P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Amiga Anywhere version will be published under Computer 
    City's own "Sultan Systems & Software" label.<FONT COLOR=SILVER><BR>
