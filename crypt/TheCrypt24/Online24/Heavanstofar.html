      <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Her hair was up in a ponytail </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Her favorite dress tied with a bow.</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Today was Daddy's Day at school, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And she couldn't wait to go. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>But her mommy tried to tell her, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>That she probably should stay home. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Why the kids might not understand, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>If she went to school alone. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>But she was not afraid; </CENTER>
      <CENTER>She knew just what to say.</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>What to tell her classmates </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Of why he wasn't there today. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>But still her mother worried,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>For her to face this day alone. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And that was why once again, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>She tried to keep her daughter home. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>But the little girl went to school,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Eager to tell them all. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>About a dad she never see's </CENTER>
      <CENTER>A dad who never calls. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>There were daddies along the wall in back, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>For everyone to meet. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Children squirming impatiently,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Anxious in their seats.</CENTER> 
<BR>
      <CENTER>One by one the teacher called,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>A student from the class. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>To introduce their daddy, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>As seconds slowly passed. </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>At last the teacher called her name,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Every child turned to stare. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Each of them was searching, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>For a man who wasn't there.</CENTER> 
<BR>       
      <FONT COLOR=LIME><CENTER>"Where's her daddy at?" </CENTER>
      <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>She heard a boy call out. </CENTER>
      <FONT COLOR=FUSHIA><CENTER>"She probably doesn't have one," </CENTER>
      <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Another student dared to shout. </CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER>And from somewhere near the back, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>She heard a daddy say,</CENTER> 
      <FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER>"Looks like another deadbeat dad, </CENTER>
     <CENTER> Too busy to waste his day." </CENTER>
<BR>       
     <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> <CENTER>The words did not offend her, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>As she smiled up at her Mom. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And looked back at her teacher, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Who told her to go on. </CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER>And with hands behind her back, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Slowly she began to speak. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And out from the mouth of a child,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Came words incredibly unique. </CENTER>
<BR>       
      <FONT COLOR=SILVER><CENTER><I>"My Daddy couldn't be here,</I> </CENTER>
      <CENTER><I>Because he lives so far away.</I></CENTER> 
     <CENTER> <I>But I know he wishes he could be,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>Since this is such a special day. </I></CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER><I>And though you cannot meet him,</I></CENTER> 
     <CENTER><I> I wanted you to know.</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>All about my daddy,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>And how much he loves me so.</I></CENTER> 
<BR>       
      <CENTER><I>He loved to tell me stories</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>He taught me to ride my bike.</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>He surprised me with pink roses,</I> </CENTER>
     <CENTER> <I>And taught me to fly a kite.</I></CENTER> 
<BR>       
      <CENTER><I>We used to share fudge sundaes,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>And ice cream in a cone.</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>And though you cannot see him,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>I'm not standing here alone. </I></CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER><I>"Cause my daddy's always with me,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>Even though we are apart</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>I know because he told me,</I> </CENTER>
      <CENTER><I>He'll forever be in my heart" </I></CENTER>
<BR>
      <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>With that, her little hand reached up,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>And lay across her chest. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Feeling her own heartbeat, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Beneath her favorite dress. </CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER>And from somewhere in the crowd of dads, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Her mother stood in tears. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Proudly watching her daughter,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>Who was wise beyond her years. </CENTER>
 <BR>      
      <CENTER>For she stood up for the love </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Of a man not in her life. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Doing what was best for her, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Doing what was right. </CENTER>
<BR>       
      <CENTER>And when she dropped her hand back down, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Staring straight into the crowd.</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>She finished with a voice so soft,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>But its message clear and loud. </CENTER>
 <BR>      
      <FONT COLOR=SILVER><CENTER><I>"I love my daddy very much, </I></CENTER>
      <CENTER><I>He's my shining star.</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>And if he could, he'd be here,</I></CENTER> 
      <CENTER><I>But heaven's just too far.</I></CENTER> 
<BR>
      <CENTER><I>You see he was a fireman</I> </CENTER>
       <CENTER><I>And died just this past year</I></CENTER> 
       <CENTER><I>When airplanes hit the towers</I></CENTER> 
       <CENTER><I>And taught Americans to fear.</I></CENTER>

<BR>  
       <CENTER><I>But sometimes when I close my eyes, </I></CENTER>
       <CENTER><I>It's like he never went away."</I></CENTER> 
       <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>And then she closed her eyes, </CENTER>
       <CENTER>And saw him there that day.</CENTER> 
<BR>       
       <CENTER>And to her mother's amazement, </CENTER>
       <CENTER>She witnessed with surprise. </CENTER>
       <CENTER>A room full of daddies and children,</CENTER> 
       <CENTER>All starting to close their eyes. </CENTER>
<BR>       
       <CENTER>Who knows what they saw before them, </CENTER>
       <CENTER>Who knows what they felt inside.</CENTER> 
       <CENTER>Perhaps for merely a second, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>They saw him at her side. </CENTER>
<BR>       
     <FONT COLOR=SILVER><CENTER> <I>"I know you're with me, Daddy," </I></CENTER>
      <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>To the silence she called out. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And what happened next made believers, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Of those once filled with doubt.  </CENTER>
<BR>
      <CENTER>Not one in that room could explain it,</CENTER> 
      <CENTER>For each of their eyes had been closed. </CENTER>
       <CENTER>But there on the desk beside her, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>Was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.</CENTER> 
<BR> 
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/ROCKROSE.GIF" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="180" ALT="rose.gif"> </CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>     
      <CENTER>And a child was blessed, if only for a moment,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>By the love of her shining bright star. </CENTER>
      <CENTER>And given the gift of believing, </CENTER>
      <CENTER>That heaven is never too far </CENTER>
