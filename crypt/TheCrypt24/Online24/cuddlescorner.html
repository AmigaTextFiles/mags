<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  was  once  a great actor who could no longer  remember  his
lines.   After  many  years he finds  a  theatre  where  they  are
prepared to give him a chance to shine again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The director says,  "<Font color=yellow><I>This is the most important part,  and it  has
only one line.  You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a
rose.   You  hold the rose to your nose with just one  finger  and
thumb,  sniff the rose deeply and then say the line 'Ah, the sweet
aroma of my mistress.'</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>"</font></font></P><Font color=yellow><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  actor  is  thrilled.  All day long  before  the  play,   he's
practicing his line over and over again.  Finally,  the time came.
The  curtain went up,  the actor walked onto the stage,  and  with
great  passion delivered the line,  "<FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Ah,  the sweet  aroma  of  my
mistress.</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>"</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The theatre erupted,  the audience was screaming with laughter but

my  6-year-old  son to run and get me a pad.   He  came  back  and

into  the  bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper.  Although
he  made a mess,  he looked adorable,  so I ran for my camera  and
took  a  few shots.  They came out so well that I had copies  made
and included one with each of our Christmas cards.  Days later,  a
relative  called  about the picture,  laughing hysterically,   and
suggesting I take a closer look.  Puzzled,  I stared at the  photo
and  was  shocked to discover that in addition to my son,   I  had
captured my reflection in the mirror wearing nothing but a camera!

one  of  the  good-looking gentlemen who works at the  store.   He
asked if he could help me.  Without thinking,  I looked at him and

checker  got on the intercom and boomed out for all the  store  to
hear,  "PRICE CHECK ON LANE THIRTEEN,  TAMPAX,  SUPER SIZE."  That
was  bad enough,  but somebody at the rear of the store apparently
misunderstood the word "Tampax" for "THUMBTACKS." In  a  business-
like  tone,  a voice boomed back over the intercom.  "DO YOU  WANT

was  quite  embarrassed and whispered that he  had  just  recently
been circumcised and he was quite itchy.  The teacher told him  to
go down to the principal's office.  He was to phone his mother and
ask her what he should do about it.  He did it and returned to his
class.  Suddenly,  there was a commotion at the back of the  room.
She  went back to investigate only to find him sitting at his desk
with  his  penis hanging out.  "I thought I told you to call  your
mom." She screamed.  "I did," he said,  "And she told me that if I
could  stick  it out till noon,  she'd come and pick  me  up  from

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An engineer,  a psychologist, and a theologian were hunting in the
wilderness of northern Canada.  Suddenly,  the temperature dropped
and  a  furious  snowstorm was upon them.   They  came  across  an
isolated cabin,  far removed from any town.  The hunters had heard
that  the  locals  in  the area were quite  hospitable,   so  they
knocked on the door to ask permission to rest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No  one answered their knocks,  but they discovered the cabin  was
unlocked and they entered.  It was a simple place ... 2 rooms with
a  minimum  of  furniture  and household equipment.   Nothing  was
unusual  about  the cabin except the stove.  It was  large,   pot-
bellied,  and made of cast-iron. What was strange about it was its
location ...  it was suspended in midair by wires attached to  the
ceiling beams.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Fascinating,</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>"  said the psychologist.  "<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>It is obvious  that  this
lonely trapper,  isolated from humanity,  has elevated this  stove
so  that  he  can  curl up under it and vicariously  experience  a
return to the womb.</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>"</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>Nonsense!</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> replied the engineer.  "<FONT COLOR=LIME><I>The man is practicing the laws
of  thermodynamics.  By elevating his stove,  he has discovered  a
way to distribute heat more evenly throughout the cabin.</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>With  all  due respect,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> interrupted the theologian,   "<I><FONT COLOR=WHITE>I'm  sure

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  three  debated the point for several hours without  resolving
the  issue.   When the trapper finally returned,  they immediately
asked  him  why he had hung his heavy pot-bellied stove  from  the
ceiling.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">His  answer  was succinct.  "<FONT COLOR=RED><I>Had plenty of wire,  not  much  stove

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  Francis,  you know all about gardens and nature. What in the
world  is  going  on down there? What happened to the  dandelions,
violets,  thistle and stuff I started eons ago? I had  a  perfect,
no-maintenance  garden plan.  Those plants grow  in  any  type  of
soil,   withstand drought and multiply with abandon.   The  nectar
from  the long lasting blossoms attracts butterflies,  honey  bees
and  flocks  of  songbirds.  I expected to see a  vast  garden  of
colors by now. But all I see are these green rectangles.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.   FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>   It's the tribes that settled there,   Lord.   The
Suburbanites.  They started calling your flowers "weeds" and  went
to great lengths to kill them and replace them with grass.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>   Grass? But it's so boring.  It's not colorful.  It  doesn't
attract  butterflies,  birds and bees,  only grubs and sod  worms.
It's  temperamental  with  temperatures.   Do  these  Suburbanites
really want all that grass growing there?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.  FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  Apparently so, Lord. They go to great pains to grow
it and keep it green.  They begin each spring by fertilizing grass
and poisoning any other plant that crops up in the lawn.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD: <FONT COLOR=AQUA>  The spring rains and warm weather probably make grass  grow
really fast. That must make the Suburbanites happy.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.  FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it grows a little,
they cut it - sometimes twice a week.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>They cut it? Do they then bale it like hay?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">ST.  FRANCIS: <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Not exactly,  Lord. Most of them rake it up and put
it in bags.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA> They bag it? Why? Is it a cash crop? Do they sell it?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">ST. FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA> No Sir. Just the opposite. They pay to throw it away.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>   Now let me get this straight.  They fertilize grass  so  it
will  grow.  And when it does grow,  they cut it off  and  pay  to
throw it away?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">ST. FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>Yes, Sir.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD: <FONT COLOR=AQUA>  These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer  when  we
cut back on the rain and turn up the heat.  That surely slows  the
growth and saves them a lot of work.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.   FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  You aren't going to believe this Lord.   When  the
grass  stops growing so fast,  they drag out hoses  and  pay  more
money  to water it so they can continue to mow it and pay  to  get
rid of it.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD: <FONT COLOR=AQUA> What nonsense.  At least they kept some of the trees.   That
was  a  sheer stroke of genius,  if I do say so myself.  The trees
grow  leaves  in  the spring to provide beauty and  shade  in  the
summer.  In the autumn they fall to the ground and form a  natural
blanket  to  keep moisture in the soil and protect the  trees  and
bushes.  Plus, as they rot, the leaves form compost to enhance the
soil. It's a natural circle of life.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.  FRANCIS:<FONT COLOR=AQUA> You better sit down,  Lord.  The Suburbanites  have
drawn  a new circle.  As soon as the leaves fall,  they rake  them
into great piles and pay to have them hauled away.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  No.  What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots  in
the winter and to keep the soil moist and loose?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ST.  FRANCIS: <FONT COLOR=AQUA> After throwing away the leaves, they go out and buy
something which they call mulch.  They haul it home and spread  it
around in place of the leaves.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA> And where do they get this mulch?</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">ST.   FRANCIS: <FONT COLOR=AQUA> They cut down trees and grind them up to make  the
mulch.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">GOD:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>   Enough.   I  don't want to think about this  anymore.   St.
Catherine,   you're in charge of the arts.  What movie  have  they
scheduled for us tonight?"</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><P ALIGN="LEFT">ST.  CATHERINE:<FONT COLOR=AQUA>"Dumb and Dumber", Lord. It's a really stupid film
about..</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
