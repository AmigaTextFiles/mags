<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you love something set it free. If it comes back, it will always be
yours. If it doesn't come back, it was never yours to begin with.
But, if it sits in your living room, messes up your stuff, eats your food,
uses your telephone, takes your money, and doesn't appear to realize that
you had set it free .....you either married it or gave birth to it.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Reason to smile: every 7 minutes, someone in an aerobics class 
    pulls a hamstring.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">My mind not only wanders, it sometimes leaves completely.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The best way to forget all your troubles is to wear tight shoes.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The nice part about living in a small town: when you don't know 
    what you're doing, someone else always does.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Just when I was getting used to yesterday, along came today.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes I think I understand everything, then I regain consciousness.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Amazing! You hang something in your closet for a while! and 
    it shrinks two sizes.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies. Mine isn't 
    all that communicative but I heard from it the other day after I said, "Body, 
    how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?" Clear as 
    a bell my body said, "listen fatty...Do it and die."</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I read this article that said the typical symptoms of stress 
    are eating too much, impulse buying, and driving too fast. Are you kidding? 
    That's my idea of a perfect day.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">If men can run the world, why can't they stop wearing neckties? 
    How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a noose around your neck?</P>
