<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>To consider that life on earth is all the whole universe has to offer, is arrogant 
beyond belief.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strong words?  Possibly - but if you look up into the night sky, and see all the 
stars, and know that with the exception of our fellow planets orbiting our sun, all 
the rest are stars, also like our own sun - which is a star - then there must be life 
out there somewhere on the planets orbiting those stars.  We cannot be the only 
life in the whole universe.  There must be other forms of intelligent life out there.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And, if there is, could they possibly be more advanced than us?  Advanced enough 
to enable them to visit earth, to make contact and teach us, or even to co-exist and 
learn our ways?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people hold differing points of view.  Some dismiss the whole alien scene as 
pure rubbish, others are convinced of things they have seen or read, and the rest of 
mankind are not sure either side are right.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unidentified Flying Objects are one thing, but the thought of beings from another 
world, visiting, communicating with us or even taking us away for whatever 
purpose, tends to provoke fear or wonderment. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are dozens of books exploring aliens, fact and fantasy.  Sometimes it can be 
difficult to determine what the defining line is between fact and fiction, especially 
when government 'experts' and departments try their hardest to conceal evidence.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many theories abound from the simple to the outrageously unbelievable.  Outlined 
are some of the common ideas put forward.</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1. <FONT COLOR=LIME> <I>The Supreme Being</I> (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>God or whomever<FONT COLOR=LIME>) <I>was/is an alien, and we are purely an 
experiment! </I> </font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we analyse the above, that we were created by an alien 
    culture as an experiment, then we can probably explain the sudden demise of 
    dinosaurs, and the rise of smaller creatures who inhabit the earth with us 
    now. Aliens would have cleansed the earth of any creatures who would have 
    inhibited our development, and designed a good home world for us. We retain 
    the thought that a supreme being created us, provides for us and protects 
    us, and watches over us, but does not interfere greatly. I hope they are not 
    too disappointed with our development.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">2.<FONT COLOR=LIME> <I>We are evolving naturally, with aliens 
    guiding us.</I></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has a similarity to the one above, except we were not 
    created but evolved, and any flashes of inspiration or inventions are 'fed' 
    to us when we have reached a certain stage in development, and we have much 
    more learning and developing ahead of us. </P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">3. <FONT COLOR=LIME> <I>We have evolved naturally up to a certain 
    stage and then aliens landed, bred with us and left us to evolve further.</I></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This helps to explain earth 'markings' only visible from 
    the air, such as the Mayan tracks, and standing stones, but leaves an uneasy 
    feeling that we are not what we thought we were.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. <FONT COLOR=LIME> <I>We are evolving naturally, but having 
    reached a certain level of intelligence, we are now very interesting to higher 
    forms of life from other planets, who wish to help with our progression.</I></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This could be good, but it would involve trusting in things 
    we do not know, a huge leap of faith, and would certainly explain the reports 
    of alien contact and certain abductions. It causes conjecture on how we have 
    advanced so quickly over the last century or so. </P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.<FONT COLOR=LIME> <I>We are evolving naturally, but having 
    reached a level of intelligence, we are now very interesting to higher forms 
    of life from other planets, who wish to stop us developing further.</I></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the scenario we are afraid of and try to rush blindly 
    away from, causing us to dismiss the reports of aliens with derision. If we 
    don't believe it, it can't be true, can it? </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain questions are sure to develop regarding any of these 
    theories, and we have no concrete evidence to accept or dismiss any of them, 
    and any answers would shake the foundations of our lives, our beliefs and 
    our trust in any one or any thing.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">So:</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Do aliens really exist, or are they just a strange quirk 
  of people's reality?</I><BR>
  <I>Do they visit earth, and, if so, what do they want?</I><BR>
  <I>Or, are we a race, evolving on earth, originally from another galaxy?</I><BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many reports exist regarding contact with aliens, whether 
    it's friendly or menacing. Should we scoff and dismiss them as nonsense or 
    is there some truth in the reports?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The US government and armed forces seem to think that they 
    do, giving rise to a secret location known as Area 51. This is too elaborate 
    for a mere hoax, and the military are not known to fantasise about such things.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strange reports seem to be prolific in the surrounding populated 
    areas, which tend to lend a further credence to the possibility of other life-forms 
    with advanced technologies. Here, we give some thoughts for you to consider........</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>The first contact with an alien being ever reported was 
    by George Adamski, from America in 1952. He and six friends went hunting UFOs 
    in the Mojave Desert, California on 29th November 1952. They anticipated photographing 
    flying saucers and claim not to have been disappointed. They spotted a cigar 
    shaped craft being chased by military jets, but noticed that as the huge craft 
    sped away it seemed to eject a smaller silver disc which landed somewhere 
    in the desert. Adamski and his friends set off to find it, hoping to take 
    some photographs. They did indeed find it, and took some photographs, and 
    Adamski ventured near it to get close-ups. Before he reached it, it shot skywards 
    and sped away into space. A few minutes later, a smaller craft appeared between 
    two mountain peaks, and landed four hundred yards away from Adamski. A figure 
    emerged and beckoned to him. At first Adamski thought it was a man, but as 
    he drew closer, he was surprised to see a humanoid, around 5 foot 3 inches 
    tall, tanned, with long blonde hair, dressed in a belted one piece brown suit, 
    with red shoes. Adamski held our his hand, and the alien shook it, and started 
    communicating using telepathy. He said his name was Orthon and he came from 
    Venus, to warn humans about the dangers of pollution and nuclear energy. He 
    refused to be photographed, and stepped back into his craft, and flew away. 
    The only witnesses were Adamski's friends, who had been close enough to see.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>In later years, Adamski also claimed to have been on board 
    a Venusian ship, and travelled to Venus, visiting the moon and Mars on the 
    way. He wrote several books regarding his meetings with the Venusians and 
    their home planet. Although many of his descriptions of the moon and Mars 
    have since been disproved, his photographs and films which he took of flying 
    craft have been examined by photographic experts who can find no hint of trickery 
    or tampering.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Several passages in his books mention phenomenon occurring 
    during space flight which have since proved to be authentic, which no-one 
    knew about at the time. It was only proved after Adamski had died, and the 
    early manned flights discovered them, so making him very difficult to dismiss 
    as a hoaxer.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>After Adamski had made his claim, there was a stream of 
    people alleging they had made contact with aliens also, which brought about 
    difficulties in discerning between hoax and genuine encounters.</I></P>
  <BR>
  <HR WIDTH=25% COLOR=YELLOW>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>In 1954, Daniel Fry, who was a scientist working at the 
    White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, claimed he had been contacted by 
    aliens. He was walking in the desert, enjoying the cool night air, having 
    missed the trip into town to watch the firework display to celebrate Independence 
    Day, and looking up into the skies, when he noticed that the stars were blocked 
    by something solid descending. A metal sphere landed in the desert about 70 
    yards from him, and heard a voice warning him not to touch the craft, as it 
    was still hot. The alien continued telepathically informing Fry that his mission 
    was to collect air samples from earth. The alien welcomed Fry and allowed 
    him to enter the craft, and took him on a trip over New York and back in half 
    an hour. Fry claimed to have felt no sensation of movement, although the craft 
    must have been travelling at over 8,000 miles an hour. As he left the craft, 
    Fry was told there would be further contacts if he preached their philosophy 
    of understanding. Fry produced photographs of UFOs and also published a book. 
    He undertook a lie detector test, but appeared to have failed. Yet many are 
    convinced of his story as, due to his profession, he had a great deal to lose.</I></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People will always be sceptical of alien encounters where 
    there is no tangible proof or other witnesses to back up the story. But what 
    of the reports of multiple witnesses? Take the following for example:-</P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE>September 1994<BR>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>On 15 September 1994, a group of schoolchildren from the 
    Ariel Primary School in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, were playing during morning break 
    in their playground, unsupervised as staff members were in a meeting with 
    the Headmaster. They all reported seeing a purple flashing light in the sky, 
    before a large disc-shaped UFO appeared and slowly descended into a empty 
    field nearby. Forty four children, out of the 100 which witnessed the event, 
    each described what happened in their own way, and, although the accounts 
    differed slightly from child to child, the unerring portions were pieced together 
    to produce a disturbing account of the events that morning by UFO investigators.</I> 
  </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A large glowing disc landed about 220 yards away in the 
    empty field, on three- legged landing gear. It was surrounded by yellow lights 
    or portholes. Balls of light (or miniature discs) flew around for a short 
    time, before three beings emerged from the craft. Described as humanoid, around 
    four feet tall and wearing shiny black, tight, one-piece suits, moving in 
    a "slow wobbling" motion, two of them approached the children who had not 
    run away. They had dark faces and large black "cat-like" eyes. Several children 
    said they heard messages when they looked into those eyes, explaining they 
    had visited to warn that humans were destroying the planet, and the children 
    could help stop the damage. Once the message was imparted, the creatures boarded 
    their craft, which started to flash, before disappearing in a flash of light. 
    </I> </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Many children went to the staff room to get the attention 
    of the teachers, but they were still in their meeting. The only adult about 
    was Alyson Kirkman, who ran the tuck shop. She thought the children were joking, 
    as did the teachers when they were told. But so many of the children all told 
    a similar story, and some were visibly shaken, that finally investigators 
    were called in. All children interviewed were asked to draw a picture of what 
    they had seen, and all the pictures were extremely similar. Many children 
    who had heard the "message" went on to take part in ecological projects.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>On the same day, in Mexico, around 8 pm, air traffic controllers 
    reported UFO activity over Metapec. Soon, hundreds of people were reporting 
    seeing a UFO hovering over rooftops in Metapec. Two sisters, Sara and Erika 
    Cuevas, were driving back to their home in Metapec. As they approached the 
    town they could see a red disc around 70 feet in diameter in the sky. Upon 
    reaching their home, they ran inside for their video camera, only to find 
    that it was not working, along with any electrical appliance in the house. 
    They went up onto the roof to get a better view of the UFO, still in the sky. 
    As they watched, two smaller craft shot out and away from it, and landed in 
    a field near their house. Two hours later, seven smaller discs appeared and 
    began darting round the field, flattening the maize stalks into a geometric 
    pattern, until one disc exploded, shooting hundreds of tiny balls, similar 
    to eyes. </I> </P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Investigators arrived the following day, together with 
    dozens of reporters, and a helicopter overflew the crop field, filming the 
    strange pattern. Despite all the activity, Sara's husband refused to accept 
    her story of the previous nights' events, so she vowed to stay up all night 
    with the video camera in case the UFO returned to get evidence. Erika volunteered 
    to wait with her, and, in the early hours of the morning, the two sisters 
    saw a glow about 30 yards away in the field. At first they thought it was 
    a light, but as they edged closer to get a better view, they saw it was a 
    glowing figure, standing in the middle of the strange pattern from the previous 
    night. Sara recorded three minutes of video tape, on the video camera which 
    now worked, showing the figure standing still in the centre of the field, 
    before it suddenly vanished. Quite clearly, on the soundtrack of the video, 
    can be heard the sisters' reactions to what they saw.</I></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>"What is it? That's horrible. Oh my God....Erika, it's 
    so ugly" Sara said. The video tape has been analysed by Professor Victor Quesada 
    at the University of Mexico's Polytechnical Institute. He reports that the 
    creature is around 4 feet tall, twenty five yards from the camera, and not 
    human. The light emanated from the creature itself. Computer enhancements 
    revealed a terrifying large, insect-like head with a small proboscis or antenna, 
    and it was carrying some kind of instrument. Soil and plant samples were taken 
    from the field which were analysed. Both soil temperature and radiation was 
    much higher than in the surrounding areas, with radiation levels at 350 per 
    cent higher than the background. The leaves of plants in the area had undergone 
    strange cellular changes. No theories were put forward as to what had been 
    caught on video.</I></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since we have no explanations, we offer this article as food 
    for thought. Are there other life forms who visit us, and are they benign 
    or terrible? Will they come in peace and teach us or to threaten and dominate 
    us? Only time will tell, but, until we know for sure, there will be many other 
    stories like the above to puzzle over.</P>

    Greatest series by Nigel Cawthorne, published by Hamlyn, which covers alien 
    encounters, alien abductions, UFO sightings and encounters, along with alien 
    conspiracy theories. Whether you believe these stories or not, the books make 
    interesting reading.</P>
