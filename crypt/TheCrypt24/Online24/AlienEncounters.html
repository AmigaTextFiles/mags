<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well!  .. You have read all the reports, Now its make your mind up
time.   Have/Are/Will Aliens from another world make contact  with
us?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Are you a believer or a Non Believer ..Do Aliens exist? are they a
figment of our over active imagination ..Are we alone?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Questions, Questions, Questions...But what of the Answers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, firstly lets break the equation <FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>"Alien Encounters"</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> into  three
separate Questions.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1) <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Can there be life on other Worlds?</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">2)  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>If there is ..Is it intelligent life?</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">3)  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Are beings from another world visiting us ..And why?</I></font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1) Is there life on other Worlds ?</B></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well! we certainly at this point in time have been given no proof,
But  then if this proof was at hand would the governments of  this
world release such to the Public?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Space  the Final Frontier ...Space is vast,  The actual number  of
Stars,  Planets and Solar Systems, We can only guess at, Certainly
it will run into Billions.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So can we really be so Ignorant and self assured to think that out
of all these systems, <B>OURS</B> is the only world capable of Sustaining
some form of life?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps  our biggest downfall is our own sense of Importance.   We
assume  that any form of Alien life should follow along  the  same
route  that our evolvement took.  Or in other words,  Aliens  from
distant worlds should look and act as we do<FONT COLOr=SILVER> (<I>Walking upright  on
two legs, Head on a Neck, Eyes forward facing etc.</I>)</font></P><FONT COLOr=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  truth  is ...Even in our own world,  We are a somewhat  of  a
Misfit species.  Are we so conceited as to believe that any  other
form of intelligent life would have to follow our own development.
Let us take a moment to look at our own world, It is abundant with
thousands  of  species of life.  Take a look at  your  own  little
garden.   It contains life,  Above the ground,  On the ground  and
under the ground ...Life exists everywhere, But we seldom look for
it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  life can be sustained on our Small planet,  and in some of the
more inhospitable regions of our world ..Then surely there must be
Planets/Worlds in the solar system that also contains life.</P></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOr=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2) Is it intelligent life</B></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Ha  ..  Once again the conceited Human brain springs into action.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Please explain Intelligent life?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">We  share this planet with a vast number of individual life  forms
<FONT COLOR=SILVER>(<I>Vegetable,  Mineral, Animal</I>) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Yet we see and think of ourselves as
the <B>ONLY</B> truly Intelligent life form.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lets  take a few examples.  Just down from my humble  abode  is  a
large tract of Waste ground.  Two streets down from us, there is a
50  foot  border  of  short grass (Kept in  trim  by  the  Council
workmen).  This borders onto the area of waste ground.  Of  course
this  is perfect for walking the dog ...and while doing so I  made
this little observation.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>The Humble Buttercup</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole area <FONT COLOR=SILVER>(<I>Short and waste ground</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA> is covered with Buttercups,
And  walking  at the border of the Short/Long Grass the  Different
development of the Humble Buttercup is striking.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>ON </B> the  Waste  area where the wild grass grows  to  a  height  of
several  feet  ...So  the   Buttercups   grow  above  this  before
flowering.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>ON</B>  the Short grass area ...Some six Inches away ..  The Buttercup
flowers  at  a height of two/three inches ...Why? they  are  borne
from  the same root ..What makes the Buttercup in the Short  grass
flower so low?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK.  I hear all your explanations ...<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>The Buttercup will grow until
it  gets enough Sunlight to flower ..Therefore in longer grass  it
will grow higher to achieve this ...So its not intelligence that is
in control.</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fair  comment  ..However two points ..  The  small  buttercup
flowers  at the same time as the taller one ..So does the  smaller
version decide to wait ..even although it has enough light,  or is
it  a case that the Buttercup in the long grass ..Speeds up growth
to try to catch up?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suffice  to  say ...The humble plant ..Grows until it  can  attain
sufficient  sunlight to allow it to flower,  So there must  be  some
sort of awareness within the Plant.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Our Deepest Oceans</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Only  quite  recently  ..Scientists have discovered  and  explored
Volcanic Blowholes on the Ocean floor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These  active  volcanos not only heat  the  water  to  well  above
boiling  point,   but saturate the water with  Poisonous  gasses.
However  they  have  found the area populated  by  sea  creatures,
Mostly  a  type of Worm and shrimp.  It was thought  that  Nothing
...Absolutely  Nothing  could survive  in  these  temperatures  or
conditions ..But there was life.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is  it then not possible that a life form could be present on some
of our closer planets ..The ones we deemed as lifeless, Because we
assumed  that nothing could exist because of the harsh  conditions
<FONT COLOR=SILVER>(<I>Once again mankinds inflated ego ..assumes that because we  can't
survive certain conditions ..then nothing else could</I>)</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  point  I  am making is that we <FONT COLOR=SILVER>(<I>Mankind</I>)  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Judge intelligence,
Purely upon our own ideals.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would  it  take  some other species to develop a weapon  of  mass
destruction,   Something that could kill all  known  life  on  our
planet  ..Before  we  would   recognise   that  species  as  being
intelligent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would it take another species to enslave other animals as  a  food
supply,   rather than hunt daily,  Yet actively kill hundreds  of
their own kind for nothing short of pleasure ...Would they then be
seen as intelligent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what has all this to do with Aliens ..Well the simple point is,
If we can't recognise Intelligence in the other species on our own
world,  how can we be expected to recognise and accept Intelligent
beings from another world.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>No!</B>  we  again  naturally  assume ..  Alien intelligent  life  forms
<B>MUST/SHOULD</B> look and act exactly like us.  It has never dawned  on
us that an alien species of high intelligence may have evolved  in
a completely different way ... Being <B>UN-HUMAN.</B></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3) Are aliens visiting us and why.</B></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well  again  no  hard and fast proof,  However  I  suppose  it  is
possible that Aliens have paid a visit to our world. After all our
little planet ..  is capable of sustaining many different types of
life  forms,  Perhaps Aliens would see this a a perfect  world  to
colonise.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think  of  this ...Only a very short time ago<FONT COLOR=SILVER> ( <I>Hundred  years  or
so</I>) <FONT COLOR=AQUA> We travelled to distant lands ..  Like Australia/America  and
Africa.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  thought that these were nice places to establish a colony,  So
using our better technology<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>weapons</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  We proceeded to wipe out the
original inhabitants and claim the land as our own.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suffice to say, If aliens Are visiting this planet, Then they have
to  be so much more advanced in a technology sense that we are,   
would they, Really be friendly to us?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First  of  all  would an Alien being consider  us  as  Intelligent
life forms?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lets  say  they studied the Venus Flytrap ...  This  simple  plant
attracts  passing Insects,  Quickly traps them  in  their  leaves,
Digest the Nutrients and discards the rest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compare  this to a human running around in a crazy manner  with  a
rolled  up Newspaper trying to swat a fly ..Which would  you  deem
the Intelligent species?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any study Aliens did of Mankind .. Would show us as an unfriendly,
barbaric race, Who regularly kill and main our own kind for unknown
obscure   reasons   ..Sometime   even   for   pleasure   or   self
gratification.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We breed quickly and spread to all corners of the planet,  killing
and persecuting all other life forms as we do so.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We develop all kinds of inventions that basically destroy our own
habitat, Our own enviroment and eventually the very planet itself.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any Aliens that have encountered humanity,  must have returned  to
there  own  World  with horrific tales of our  barbaric  race.   I
certainly  doubt that any species from distant  worlds,   want  to
make contact with us ...They may want to study us,  Dissect us,  or
even wipe us out ..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But be our friends?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Would you want to be friends with a human?</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>My Conclusions</B></P>

<FONT COLOR=Yellow><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Is there life on other worlds?</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Yes! It may not  be our idea of
life ..But life none the less.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Is  it  intelligent life?</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...  Almost all life apart for the  very
basic form, must have a certain degree of Intelligence. Even the
humble earthworm caught in a Rain storm has suffient intelligence
to know that they must surface to survive.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are Alien Lifeforms Highly intelligent ..Capable of Space Travel?
Possibly in truth we have no way of knowing unless they make
contact.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Are they Visiting us?</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA> ... I think it is possible that we are being
Observed by Alien Beings. To what end I dread to think.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until We<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>The members of the Human race</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA> are capable of living in
peace and harmony with, Not only each other, But also other
earthly species, and Mother Nature herself, The chances of
Friendly comunications with Species from other worlds would be
nil.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are having Alien Encounters ..Its not because they want to
know us or strike up relations with us.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its our planet<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>Earth</I>) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>that is the attraction and the ultimate
goal of the Visitors would be the destruction of Mankind.</font></font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=Yellow><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
