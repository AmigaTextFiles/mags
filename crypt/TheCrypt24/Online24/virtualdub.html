    VirtualDub Review 
  </center></h1></font>
<blockquote>
<p>VirtualDub is one of those utilities concerned with video files. </p>
<p>It can be used to change a file from one format to another. Very handy if you 
  want to make the file more accessible by changing the codec involved.</p>
<p>It can also be used to append files e.g. you downloaded a movie and it came 
  in 3 pieces. In my case, I use the TV card I wrote about. This saves the file 
  as an  uncompressed AVI file with uncompressed audio. Changing these are a dawdle 
  with this program. </p>
<p>Right, lets start at the beginning……..always a good point to start at <span>J</span></p>
  <p>VirtualDub can be found at  most download sites on the Net specializing in 
    DVD ripping or movie editing. Use a search engine and simple type in VirtualDub……..</p>
<p>The download file is less than a meg. Now a lot of time wasted getting it …even 
  for those of us stuck on a 56k modem , thanks to BT.</p>

<p>As you can see , VirtualDub is released under the GNU license.</p>
<p>The program is downloaded as a zip file. Installing is a simple matter of unzipping 
  where you will. </p>
<p>Running the program gives you the following view……</p>
  <p> <img width=554 height=420

<p>Again, a deceptively simple GUI. Here are some grabs of the menus.</p>

  <p> <img width=571 height=219
src="Images/vdimage012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>As you can see from all the grabs, a helluva lot of stuff to figure out, especially 
  if, like me, you are only trialling it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as you can see from the help menu, there is a large amount of 
  information available about the program and how to use it. Simply let the program 
  take you to the knowledge base for instance to see how to guides. Alternatively, 
  you can simply launch the help file which details the workings of the program 
  and explains lots of the options. I would recommend a lot of reading beforehand 
  .</p>
<p>This is a very involved program and you could easily destroy your favourite 
  clip if you aren’t careful.</p>
<p>This isn’t a small program, but it is fast!!</p>
  <p>The program is dependent of how fast your processor is, so a newer ,faster 
    processor definitely helps if you intend working with this. </p>
<p>However, I use an Athlon processor running at 750mhz. It may be on the slow 
  side nowadays, but it still manages to stream data (as in converting an audio 
  or video stream ) reasonably fast. I have had values of up to 130 odd frames 
  per second. On the kids P.C. which uses a P4 at 1900mhz, the results are a lot 
  faster <span>J</span></p>
<p>I’ve no intention here of actually trying to explain all the menus  (even if 
  I knew what everything did), so I’ll simply try and show how to convert a file. 
</p>
<p>Firstly, I load a file made using the TV card……in this case an advert from 
  one of the channels. </p>
  <p> <img width=470 height=374
src="Images/vdimage013.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>A quick look at the properties of the file gives the following………</p>
  <p> <img width=441 height=352
src="Images/vdimage014.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>As above, a large AVI file for 29 seconds of video. If I had captured it at 
  its highest rate and at the best quality of sound, you can imagine the size 
  of the resultant file.</p>
  <p>OK, lets change it to something that makes it a bit smaller. I downloaded the 
    Divx5.0 bundle from Cnet, so lets see how that performs.</p>
<p>Firstly, we go to the video menu and select compression. I selected the DivX5.0 
  codec as I said earlier. </p>
  <p> <img width=564 height=375
src="Images/vdimage015.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>I then go to the audio menu and select full processing mode. </p>
  <p> <img width=296 height=238
src="Images/vdimage016.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>I also selected compression and used the codec for DivX  audio. This brought 
  up a submenu where it asked what quality I wanted. I chose 20kbps.</p>
  <p> <img width=531 height=399
src="Images/vdimage018.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>This should be good enough for me. </p>
<p>Now simply select “save as AVI” from the file menu and choose a name.</p>
<p>Not exactly rocket science ,is it? Wonderful what programmers can make easy 
  nowadays.</p>
  <p> <img width=314 height=482
src="Images/vdimage019.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>Once I have done that, the program goes and does all the hard work………</p>
  <p> <img width=293 height=321
src="Images/vdimage021.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"> </p>
<p>Yummy, look at that for a result….. 94.7 fps. Wow, this program can shift.</p>
<p>Reloading the file, lets have a look at the file properties now…..</p>
  <p> <img width=441 height=352
src="Images/vdimage023.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1041"> </p>
<p>A slight difference, I’m sure you’ll agree. The filesize went from </p>
<p>44.1 mb down to 2.82mb. </p>
<p>As you saw from the grabs, it didn’t exactly take a lot of time either. </p>
<p>Give this program a try and see what you think yourselves. It is free, small 
  and has a very fast engine.</p>
<p>If you want to append, edit videos or simply to compress them, this is the 
  mutts nuts!!!</p>
<p>As I said, the program has far too many options available to it for me to even 
  attempt to do justice to it. Try it and explore it yourselves.</p>
