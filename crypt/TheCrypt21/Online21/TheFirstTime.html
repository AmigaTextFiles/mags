The  night  air  was cool on his skin.Jake  staggered  onto the sidewalk andtried to look as composed as possible.People   were   going  home  after  anevening  out.   Could  they  sense hisguilt?   He  was  certain  they could.His  heart  thudded against his breastbone.    He   could  feel  their  eyesburning    into   him,   reading   histhoughts,   burrowing  into  his  verysoul.   He  began  to walk.  He had towalk.   He  would have to keep walkinguntil  they  caught  up  with him.  Hecaught  a  glance at his reflection inthe  window  of  a  parked  truck.  OhChrist,  he still had her blood on hisface.   Had  they  noticed it too?  Hewiped it off with his sleeve cuff, andcontinued walking.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>   The  neon lights of the diner beckonedto  him  and  he swished through theirglass   doors.   He'd  be  safe  here.Well,   for  a  while  at  least.   Heordered  a  coke  and  retreated  to adimly  lit table in the corner.  Therewas  a  moth on the table.  He reachedout a fist to flatten it, but withdrewand  it  escaped.   He had done enoughfor  one  night.  The old wireless wasfeebly  belting  out  an  old  sixtiessong.  It was nearly ten.  There wouldbe  a  news  bulletin  then.  Had theyfound her yet?
<P>
Grimly,  he  began to recall the wholesordid  evening  as he stared into hiscoke.   She was a pretty little thing.Patsy.   He  said her name aloud.  Thewaitress behind the counter gave him apuzzled  look, then continued to flirtwith the truckers.  Sweet little Patsyfrom  the hardware store.  His mom hadbeen  more  excited  than  him when hetold her they were going to the moviesthat  evening.   She  ironed  his bestshirt   and  smuggled  some  of  pop'saftershave  from the bathroom cabinet.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I  remember  my  first date." Pop hadsaid  over  his  news journal.  "I wasabout your age too Jake.  We went to adrive-in  and  made out in the parkinglot." He chuckled, recalling his firsttime.  "But she wasn't on the pill andI  had  to  marry her." Jake grimaced.He was tired of Pop's anecdotes of howhe was an accident.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
He didn't want to hear it, not tonightof   all  nights.   "Your  Pop's  justteasing."  Mom  had soothed.  "Now yougo out and enjoy yourself."Perhaps  that  was the reason why Jakehad   left   that  night  in  a  rage.Perhaps he wouldn't have done it if ithadn't  been  filling his head for thewhole  evening.   Perhaps if Patsy hadwanted  it  too.  Patsy was beautiful.Every  guy  in school wanted to be herfirst.   She was the only girl who haddeveloped  breasts  and,  boy, did sheknow  how to show them off!  He pickedher  up  at  seven, and almost came onthe  spot  when  he  saw her.  She waswearing a skin tight, red velvet dressand  no  bra.  He knew that because hecould see her tiny nipples poking intothe fabric.  He felt a stirring in hisundershorts  as  his eyes drank in thelong  sweep  of her smooth girlish egsand  her  innocent rosebud lips, whichhad   been  painted  with  glossy  redlipstick.   Probably  from  her  mom'smake-up  box.   He felt sure no motherwould allow their daug
hter out lookinglike  this!   He  was  aware  of  thatvelvet   dress  throughout  the  wholemovie.   Or  rather,  he  was aware ofwhat  was IN that dress throughout themovie.   He  wanted  her, and she knewit.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
"Let's  go  somewhere,  Jake." She hadpurred  after  the  movie.   "Let's godown to the old storeroom and talk.  Idon't   have  to  be  home  until  tenthirty."  She  had smiled knowingly athim.   "I've  always  liked you, Jake.You're  cute.  Your arse is cute.  Anyguy with a cute arse gets top marks inmy book."
<P>
So,  he  drove  her in silence down tothe old abandoned warehouse, trying toignore  the  feelings  his  pants wereemitting.   Trying  to  keep his handssteady  on the wheel, ignoring the hotsweat on his brow.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
"Keep your eyes on the road, Jakey oldguy!"  He  had  told himself silently."Not  long  now."  He thought crazily."Not long now."   
<P>
The  warehouse  was  dark  and  dusty."God,  it's so hot in here." Patsy hadcommented  when  they  were sitting onthe  cluttered  floor.  She fanned herface  with  her hand.  "Aren't you hotin  that  thick  shirt,  Jake?" He hadnoticed   her   eyelids   had  droopedsexily,  and  her  voice  had became ahusky  whisper.   He nodded nervously.So  this  was seduction.  This was thething  all  the  Oprah shows had ravedabout.   And,  sweet little Patsy fromthe hardware store knew how to do it!
<P>
"Why  don't  you  take  it  off?"  Shemurmured,  wrapping  one  of  her longfingers  round a stray blond curl.  "Ibet you'll feel better..."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I thought you wanted to talk, Patsy!"He  snapped,  wrenching  her hand fromhis  face.   "You  said  we could comehere to talk."
<P>
"Shit!"  He  thought.   "I've blown itnow.   Why  don't  I just do it?  LookJakey, She's begging for it!"   
<P>
He  smiled  humbly at her, but she waslooking at him strangely.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"They  were  right"  she said.  "Cindyand  Prue  were right.  You are weird.Are you really gay, Jake?"
<P>
"What?"  He  couldn't believe what shehad  just  said, and then cold realitybegan  to  set in.  It had been a set-up.   A  set-up  to  see if wimpy JakeO'Reilly  was  bent.   He  felt a warmrush  rise  up  from his ankles to thetop of his head.  He had to calm down.And  he  had  to  prove that Cindy andPrue didn't have a clue what they wereharping on about.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"It's   alright,  Jake."  She  laughedbitterly.   "Lot's  of  guys in schoolare gay.  Cindy and Prue said that 40%of the population are gay."
<P>
Cindy  and  Prue.   Cindy  and fuckingPrue.   He  yelled  at her to shut thefuck  up  and  her chest heaved in herdress.    "Get   your  tits  out",  heordered  her, relishing in the look ofsurprise which swept over her face.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"No!"  She cried, crossing her arms infront  of her.  "Why do you want me todo that?"
<P>
"I  think  I've got a point to prove."He  spat  out, and, taking hold of herarms,  he  pressed  her onto the floorand  ripped  the  front  of  her dressaway.   Now,  Jake  O'Reilly  wasn't aviolent person, nor did he have a sex-crazed  mind.   But that night, in theold,   abandoned  warehouse,  two  newtraits  were added to his personality.He had never seen real breasts before,let   alone   touched  them.   Patsy'sbreasts   were   pert  and  soft.   Hegrasped  one and squeezed.  She yelpedin pain.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Shut  up!"  He  breathed quietly, "OrI'll slap you." She looked shocked andlay  rigidly  as  his  searching handscontinued      their      exploration.Cautiously, he bent his blond head andpressed  his  lips  onto  a hard, pinknipple.   It  reminded him of a frozenpea   but   tasted  much  better.   Hethought  he  could  hear Patsy moaningsoftly,  but  he  didn't  want  her toenjoy  it.   He  wanted  her to sufferlike he'd suffered at high school.  Hesank   his  teeth  into  the  fragrantsoftness  and his mouth welled up witha   warm   metallic  richness.   Patsyscreamed.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"What are you doing?" She screeched.
<P>
"What  have  you  done?" He pushed herroughly back down into the dust.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"That's   for   making  a  noise."  Hesnarled.    "One  more  sound,  and  Iswear,   I'll  kill  you."  His  wordsshocked  him.  What was he doing?  Hisvoice  didn't  sound like his own, yethis  undershorts were bulging with hisever-increasing  erection.  "I want tofuck  you."  He said calmly.  "And I'mgoing to."<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
Ignoring  her struggles, he hitched upher  dress and delved his fingers intoher panties.  It was warm and moist inthere   and  he  liked  it.   She  waswhimpering.    "No.    Don't.   Pleasedon't.   Please..." But he ignored heragain.   He tore the wispy fabric awayand  looked  down at the soft triangleof  sparse black hair.  He could smellher  faint musky odour and Christ, howbadly  did he want to fuck that pussy!He  held  her  down  with  one arm andbegan  to  tear  at his jeans with theother.   She  was sobbing, begging himnot  to do it, pleading that she was avirgin.   "Don't hurt me..." She wept."Please, don't hurt me."<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
In a frenzy of rage he lifted his handand  punched  her  on  the cheek.  Shescreamed.   He  done  it  again,  thenagain, until she lay quietly, too weakto protest any further.
<P>
"That's   better."   He  said  softly,brushing   her   hair  from  her  eyestenderly.  "That's better, isn't it?"
<P>
"You're  crazy."  She sobbed.  "I knewit all along."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Oh, yeah?" He growled loudly.  "Well,here's a little food for thought."   
<P>
He  snatched  hold  of  his  penis andstabbed  it  against  her  labia.   Hemissed.   "Fuck!"  He  cursed.   "Keepfucking still.  I can't get it in!" Hethrust  forwards again and he felt thesoft  folds  of skin part a little andthen  enfold his shaft.  Jesus, it wastight.   He  had  to move slowly or hewould  have  hurt  himself.  Patsy laythere   drowsily,   so  he  shook  herharshly.    He   wanted  her  to  feeleverything  he  was doing.  After all,the  first  time  is  supposed to be amemorable experience.  She realised hewas  inside  her  and  feebly tried topush him off.  He was groaning, and hehad  his  eyes closed.  A thin film ofsweat covered his face.  He was havingthe  time  of his life.  He growled ashe  felt  that  familiar  twinge  deepinside   his   balls.   "Oh  God!"  Hegasped.  "I'm gonna co..." He explodedinside  her  and  for a while, he justlay  there  on  top of her, his breathslowly coming back to him.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Patsy."  He shoved her roughly.  "Youon  the  pill?"  She  didn't move.  Heshook harder.  "Patsy?"
<P>
She  stirred  under  him and shook herhead.     "Oh,    fuck!"   He   sighedbreathlessly.    Then,  with  blindingreality,  his father's words came backto  him.   "WE MADE OUT IN THE PARKINGLOT.   SHE WASN'T ON THE PILL SO I HADTO MARRY HER."
<P>
"I  can't  marry  you  Patsy."  He wasbabbling  senselessly.   "I'm going toHarvard.   I  don't  want  a kid.  Oh,Patsy,    Patsy.     I   know   you'llunderstand...  I know you will..." Shemoaned in pain, and a trickle of bloodseeped  out  on to her thighs.  "Yes."He    laughed.     "I    know   you'llunderstand"<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
She  gasped  as  his  hands  tightenedround her throat.  Her body heaved andshe  spluttered  and kicked, trying toshake  him  off.   She  went weak, herhands  still clutching at his, tearingat  his  skin,  until, total oblivion.He  dressed  calmly  and with one lastflourish,  tugged  down  her dress andstraightened  her  brown hair.  That'show  Jake  came to be staggering alongthe sidewalk after the 8pm movie.   
<P>
He sighed and downed the last dregs ofhis  coke.   They'd be looking for himsoon.    With  a  fleeting  panic,  herealised that he wanted to be with hisfamily for one last night.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
His  mom  was  in  bed when he finallyrolled in at eleven, but Pop was stillreading  his journal in his chair.  Hefolded it neatly as Jake walked in andsmiling, took off his glasses.
<P>
"Well,  son,"  He  grinned  knowingly."Did you take my advice?"
<P>
"Yes,  Pop." Jake said quietly.  "I'vefinally had my first time."
<P>
"Did  you  make  sure  she  was on thepill?"  He  asked anxiously, observinghis  son  steadily  for  any  signs ofdeception.
<P>
"Oh,  yes  Pop." Jake smiled softly tohimself.   "Don't  worry.  I took careof that.  Just as you told me to."
<P>
"That's  my  boy."  And  Mr.  O'Reillywinked and went back to his journal.
