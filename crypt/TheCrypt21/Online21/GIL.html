<FONT COLOR=red>                 <CENTER> ACTUAL COMMENTS MADE IN THE N.Y.C. SCHOOLS</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Actual comments made by New York City school teachers on their report      cards  as part of their final report for the school year.  All of the      teachers  were  reprimanded for what they wrote, but in spite of that      these are some of the things which were written by them.  Actually, I      think  they  should  have  been  congratulated  for their creativity,      preception and honesty.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>       1. <FONT COLOR=cyan>Since  my  last  report,  your  child  has hit rock bottom and has         started to dig.<FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      2.<FONT COLOR=cyan> I would not allow this student to breed. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      3.<FONT COLOR=cyan> Your child has delusions of adequacy. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      4.<FONT COLOR=cyan> Your child is depriving a village somewhere of an idiot. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      5. <FONT COLOR=cyan>Your  son  sets low personal standards and then consistently fails         to achieve them.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>       6.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The student has a "full six-pack" but lacks the plastic thing         to hold it all together. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      7.<FONT COLOR=cyan> This child has been working with glue too much. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      8.<FONT COLOR=cyan> When your daughter's IQ reaches 50, you should sell. <FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      9.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The  gates are down, the lights are flashing, but the train isn't         coming.<FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      10.<FONT COLOR=cyan> If  this  student were any more stupid, he'd have to be watered          twice a week.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      11.<FONT COLOR=cyan> It's  impossible  to  believe the sperm that created this child          beat out 1,000,000 others.<FONT COLOR=white>

<FONT COLOR=red>                        <CENTER>Subject: Divorcing after 45 years</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      An elderly man in Phoenix calls his son in New York and says, "I hate      to  ruin  your day, but I have to tell you that your mother and I are      divorcing; forty-five years of misery is enough."
<P>
      "Pop, what are you talking about?" the son screams.
<P>
      "We  can't  stand  the  sight  of each other any longer," the old man      says.  "We're sick of each other, and I'm sick of talking about this,      so you call your sister in Chicago and tell her."
<P>
      Frantic,  the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone.  "Like      heck they're getting divorced," she shouts, "I'll take care of this."
<P>
      She  calls  Phoenix immediately, and screams at the old man, "You are      NOT  getting  divorced.   Don't  do a single thing until I get there.      I'm calling my brother back, and we'll both be there tomorrow.  Until      then, don't do a thing, DO YOU HEAR ME?" and hangs up.
<P>
      The  old  man  hangs  up  his  phone,  smiles  and turns to his wife.      "Okay,"  he  says,  "They're coming for Thanksgiving and paying their      own fares...  Now what do we do for Christmas?"

<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  first  day  of  school  for  the  7th  grade class brought a new      student, Suzuki, the son of a Japanese businessman.
<P>
      The  teacher  said,  "Let's begin by reviewing some American history.      Who said, 'Give me Liberty or give me death'?"
<P>
      She  saw a sea of blank faces, except for that of Suzuki, who had his      hand up.
<P>
      "Patrick Henry, 1775."
<P>
      "Very  good, Suzuki!", said the teacher, "Now who said 'Government of      the  people,  by the people, for the people shall not perish from the      earth'?"
<P>
      Again, no response, except from Suzuki.
<P>
      "Abraham Lincoln, 1863."
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "Very  good  again!"  The  teacher  snapped at the class, "Class, you      should  be  ashamed.   Suzuki,  who is new to our country, knows more      about our history than you do."
<P>
      She heard a loud whisper: "F-----g Japanese."
<P>
      "Who said that?" she demanded.
<P>
      Suzuki, once more, put his hand up.
<P>
      "Lee Iacocca, 1982."
<P>
      At that point, a student in the back sighed, "I'm gonna puke!"
<P>
      The  teacher  glared at the class and asked "All right!  Now who said      that?"
<P>
      Suzuki said, "George Bush to Japanese Prime Minister, 1991."
<P>
      Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah! Suck this!"
<P>
      Suzuki  jumped  out  of  his chair waving his hand and shouted to the      teacher, "Bill Clinton, 1997!"<FONT COLOR=red>

<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      It's  the  only  type  of  cooking  a "real" man will do.  When a man      volunteers  to  do such cooking, the following chain of events is put      into motion:<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      1.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman goes to the store to pick up meat, veggies and such.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      2.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman fixes the salad, vegetables and dessert.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      3.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The  woman  prepares  the  meat  for  cooking, places it on a tray      along  with  the necessary cooking utensils, and takes it to the man,      who is lounging beside the grill, drinking a beer.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      4.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The man places the meat on the grill.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      5.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman goes inside to set the table and check the vegetables.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      6.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat needs turning.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      7.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman goes in to check for last minute details
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>      8.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman comes out to tell the man that the meat is burning.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      9.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The man takes the meat off the grill and hands it to the woman.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      10.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The woman prepares the plates and brings them to the table.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      11.<FONT COLOR=cyan> After eating, the woman clears the table and does the dishes.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      12.<FONT COLOR=cyan> The  mans  ask the woman how she enjoyed "her night off".  And,      upon  seeing  her  annoyed  reaction,  concludes that there's just no      pleasing some women.

<P>
      At  a  hastily  called  press conference  this  morning,   Taliban      Minister of Emigration,  Mohammed Omar,  warned the United  States      that  if  any  additional   military   action  was  taken  against      Afghanistan,  Taliban authorities would not hesitate  to  cut  off      America's supply of convenience store managers.

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      A  man  boards  an airplane and takes his seat.  As he settles in, he      glances  up  and  sees a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He      soon  realizes  she  is  heading  straight towards his seat.  Low and      behold,  she  takes  the seat right beside his.  Eager to strike up a      conversation, he blurts out, "Business trip or vacation?"
<P>
      She  turns,  smiles  and  says,  "Business.   I'm going to the annual      Nymphomaniac  Convention  in Chicago." He swallows hard.  Here is the      most  gorgeous  woman he has ever seen, sitting next to him and she's      going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!
<P>
      Struggling  to  maintain  his composure, he calmly asks, "What's your      business role at this convention?
<P>
      "Lecturer,"  she  says.   "I  use my experience to debunk some of the      popular myths about sexuality."
<P>
      Really," he says, swallowing hard, "what myths are those?"
<P>
      "Well,"  she explains, "one popular myth is that African American men      are  the  most  well-endowed  when, in fact, it's the Native American      Indian  who  is  most  likely to possess that trait.  Another popular      myth  is that French men are the best lovers, when actually it is the      men  of  Jewish  descent.   However,  we  have  found  that  the best      potential lover in all categories is the Southern Redneck."
<P>
      Suddenly, the woman becomes a little uncomfortable and blushes.  "I'm      sorry,"  she says, "I shouldn't be discussing this with you.  I don't      even know your name!"
<P>
      "Tonto," the man says, "Tonto Goldstein!  But my friends just call me      Bubba."<FONT COLOR=red>

      A  man walks into a pharmacy and wanders up and down the aisles.  The      salesgirl  notices  him and asks him if she can help him.  He answers      that  he  is  looking for a box of tampons for his wife.  She directs      him  down the correct aisle.  A few minutes later, he deposits a huge      bag  of  cotton balls and a ball of string on the counter.  She says,      confused,  "Sir, I thought you were looking for some tampons for your      wife?".   He  answers, "You see, it's like this, yesterday, I sent my      wife  to the store to get me a carton of cigarettes and she came home      with  a tin of tobacco and some rolling papers.  So, I figure that if      I have to roll my own, SO DOES SHE!
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Three  handsome male dogs are walking down the street when they see a      beautiful, enticing, female poodle.
<P>
      The  three  male dogs fall all over themselves in an effort to be the      one  to  reach  her first, but end up arriving in front of her at the      same  time.   They're  speechless  before  her  beauty, slobbering on      themselves and hoping for just a glance from her in return.
<P>
      Aware  of her charms and her obvious effect on the three suitors, she      decides  to  be  kind  and tells them, "The first one who can use the      words  "liver"  and  "cheese" together in an imaginative, intelligent      sentence can go out with me."
<P>
      The  sturdy,  muscular  black  Lab speaks up quickly and says "I love      liver and cheese."
<P>
      "Oh,  how  childish," said the Poodle.  "That shows no imagination or      intelligence  whatsoever."  She  turned  to  the  tall,  shiny Golden      Retriever and said "How well can you do?"
<P>
      "Um. I HATE liver and cheese," blurts the Golden Retriever.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "My,  my,"  said the Poodle.  "I guess it's hopeless.  That's just as      dumb  as the Lab's sentence." She then turns to the last of the three      dogs and says, "How about you, little guy?"
<P>
      The  last  of  the  three, tiny in stature but big in finesse, is the      Chihuahua.
<P>
      He  gives  her a smile, a sly wink, turns to the Golden Retriever and      the Lab and says:  "Liver alone.  Cheese mine."

      A sixteen year old boy is sneaking into the house at 3:00 am (3 hours      after  curfew), when he is confronted by his father.  "Where the hell      have  you  been, boy?" he said.  "Sorry Dad, I just lost track of the      time.   What  a  night!  We ate, we danced, we hugged, we kissed, and      Dad  --  I had my first blow job!" The father's demeanor changes to a      swaggering   pride,   and   a   sly  smile  crept  across  his  face.      "Congratulations,  boy!   How  did you like it?  "Well, it was pretty      good, but it took a long time to get that taste out of my mouth."

<P>
      A  man  and  a woman were driving down the road arguing about  his      deplorable infidelity.
<P>
      Suddenly  the woman reaches over and slices off the  man's  penis,      and angrily tosses its out the window of the car.
<P>
      Driving  behind the car is a man in a pickup truck  with  his  10-      year-old  daughter chatting away beside him.  All of a sudden  the      penis  smacks the pickup in the windshield,  sticks for a  moment,      then flies off.
<P>
      Surprised,  the daughter asks her daddy,  "Daddy what the heck was      that?"
<P>
      Not  wanting to expose his 10-year-old daughter to sex at  such  a      tender age, the father replies, "It was only a bug, honey."
<P>
      The daughter gets a confused look on her face,  and after a minute      she says, "Sure had a big dick!"
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Two dwarfs go into a bar, where they pick up two prostitutes and take      them  to  their  separate  hotel rooms.  The first dwarf, however, is      unable  to get an erection.  His depression is made worse by the fact      that,  from  the  next  room, he hears his little friend shouting out      cries  of  "Here  I  come again ...  ONE, TWO,THREE...UUH!" all night      long.   In  the morning, the second dwarf asks the first, "How did it      go?"  The  first mutters, "It was so embarrassing.  I simply couldn't      get  a  hard on.  The second dwarf shook his head.  "You think that's      embarrassing?" "I couldn't even get up on the fucking bed.."

<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      At  a nursing home in Miami, Florida, a group of senior citizens were      sitting around talking about their ailments:
<P>
      "My arms are so weak I can hardly lift this cup of coffee," said one.
<P>
      "Yes,  I  know.  My cataracts are so bad I can't even see my coffee,"      replied another.
<P>
      "I  can't  turn  my head because of the arthritis in my neck," said a      third, to which several nodded weakly in agreement.
<P>
      "My blood pressure pills make me dizzy," another went on.
<P>
      "I  guess that's the price we pay for getting old," winced an old man      as he slowly shook his head.
<P>
      Then there was a short moment of silence.
<P>
      "Well,  it's not that bad," said one woman cheerfully.  "Thank God we      can all still drive."
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>                                  <CENTER>Absolution</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      While  the  Pope  was in St.  Louis he decided to grant absolution to      three  sinners.   The first person to come up was Richard Nixon.  The      Pope asked, "What is your sin?"
<P>
      "I  hired  people  to  break  into  the  Watergate  Hotel,  and I did      dishonorable  things while in office." The Pope replied, "Kneel down.      I'll bless you and grant you absolution."
<P>
      Next in line was Bill Clinton. "What was your sin, son?"
<P>
      "I  cheated  on  my  wife  while  in power." The Philanderer in Chief      replied.   "Kneel  down,  my  son.   I'll  bless  you  and  grant you      absolution."
<P>
      A third person came up and the Pope asked, "What is your name?"
<P>
      "Monica Lewinsky."
<P>
      The  Pope  stroked  his chin.  "Hmmmm.....  perhaps you should remain      standing."

<P>
      He  was in an odd mood Sunday night.  We planned to meet at a bar for      a  drink.   I  had  spent  the  afternoon shopping with the girls.  I      thought  it might have been my fault because I was a bit later than I      promised, but he didn't say much about it.
<P>
      The  conversation  was  very slow going so I thought we should go off      somewhere  more intimate so we could talk more privately.  We went to      this  restaurant  and  he  was  STILL acting a bit funny.  I tried to      cheer  him  up  and  started to wonder whether it was me or something      else.
<P>
      I  asked  him, and he said no.  But I wasn't really sure.  So anyway,      in  the  car on the way back home, I said that I loved him deeply and      he  just  put  his  arm  around me.  I didn't know what the hell that      meant because you know he didn't say it back or anything.  We finally      got home and I was wondering if he was going to leave me!  So I tried      to get him to talk but he just switched on the TV.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Reluctantly,  I  said  I was going to go to bed.  Then after about 10      minutes,  he  joined  me and to my surprise, we made great passionate      love.   But,  he still seemed really distracted, so afterwards I just      wanted  to  confront  him  but  I just cried myself to sleep.  I just      don't  know  what  to do anymore.  I mean, I really think he's seeing      someone else.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      This is an article submitted to a 1999 Louisville Sentinel contest to      find out who had the wildest Christmas dinner.  This won first prize.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>      Christmas with Louise<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      As  a  joke,  my  brother  used to hang a pair of panty hose over his      fireplace  before  Christmas.  He said all he wanted was for Santa to      fill them.
<P>
      What  they  say  about  Santa  checking  the  list twice must be true      because  every Christmas morning, although Jay's kids' stockings were      overflowed, his poor pantyhose hung sadly empty.
<P>
      One  year I decided to make his dream come true.  I put on sunglasses      and went in search of an inflatable love doll.  They don't sell those      things  at  Walmart.  I had to go to an adult bookstore downtown.  If      you've never been in an X-rated store, don't go.  You'll only confuse      yourself.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      I  was there an hour saying things like, "What does this do?" "You're      kidding  me!"  "Who  would  buy  that?"  Finally,  I  made  it to the      inflatable doll section.
<P>
      I  wanted  to  buy  a  standard,  uncomplicated  doll that could also      substitute  as  a  passenger  in my truck so I could use the car pool      lane during rush hour.
<P>
      Finding  what  I  wanted  was  difficult.   Love  dolls  come in many      different  models.  The top of the line, according to the side of the      box,  could do things I'd only seen in a book on animal husbandry.  I      settled  for  "Lovable  Louise."  She  was at the bottom of the price      scale.   To call Louise a "doll" took a huge leap of imagination. 
<P>
      On  Christmas  Eve, with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came      to  life.   My  sister-in-law was in on the plan and let me in during      the  wee  morning hours, long after Santa had come and gone, I filled      the  dangling pantyhose with Louise's pliant legs and bottom.  I also      ate  some  cookies  and  drank  what remained of a glass of milk on a      nearby tray.  I went home, and giggled for a couple of hours.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  next morning my brother called to say that Santa had been to his      house  and  left  a present that had made him VERY happy but had left      the dog confused.  She would bark, start to walk away, then come back      and  bark  some more.  We all agreed that Louise should remain in her      panty  hose so the rest of the family could admire her when they came      over for the traditional Christmas dinner. 
<P>
      My  grandmother  noticed  Louise  the  moment she walked in the door.      "What  the  hell  is that?" she asked.  My brother quickly explained,      "It's a doll."
<P>
      "Who  would  play  with  something like that?" Granny snapped.  I had      several  candidates  in mind, but kept my mouth shut.  "Where are her      clothes?"
<P>
      Granny  continued.   "Boy,  that  turkey sure smells nice, Gran," Jay      said,  trying  to  steer  her  into  the dining room.  But Granny was      relentless.   "Why  doesn't  she have any teeth?" Again, I could have      answered,  but  why  would  I?  It was Christmas and no one wanted to      ride  in the back of the ambulance saying, "Hang on Granny, Hang on!"
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      My grandfather, a delightful old man with poor eyesight, sidled up to      me  and said, "Hey, who's the naked gal by the fireplace?" I told him      she  was  Jay's friend.  A few minutes later I noticed Grandpa by the      mantel,  talking to Louise.  Not just talking, but actually flirting.      It  was  then that we realized this might be Grandpa's last Christmas      at home.
<P>
      The  dinner  went  well.   We made the usual small talk about who had      died,  who  was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly Louise      made a noise that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the      morning.   Then she lurched from the panty hose, flew around the room      twice, and fell in a heap in front of the sofa.
<P>
      The  cat  screamed.   I  passed  cranberry sauce through my nose, and      Grandpa   ran   across  the  room,  fell  to  his  knees,  and  began      administering  mouth  to  mouth  resuscitation.  My brother fell back      over  his  chair  and wet his pants and Granny threw down her napkin,      stomped  out  of  the  room,  and  sat  in  the car.  It was indeed a      Christmas to treasure and remember.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Later  in my brother's garage, we conducted a thorough examination to      decide the cause of Louise's collapse.  We discovered that Louise had      suffered from a hot ember to the back of her right thigh.
<P>
      Fortunately,  thanks  to  a wonder drug called duct tape, we restored      her  to  perfect  health.  Louise went on to star in several bachelor      party  movies.   I  think Grandpa still calls her whenever he can get      out of the house.

<P>
      A  recent study found out which days men prefer to have  sex.   It      was  found that men preferred to engage in sexual activity on  the      days that startedwith the letter "T" ......... 
<P>
      Examples  of  those days are:  Tuesday,  Thursday,   Thanksgiving,      Today, Tomorrow, Thaturday and Thunday<FONT COLOR=red>

<P>
      A  recent survey was conducted to discover why men get out of  bed      in  the  middle of the night.  5% said it was to get  a  glass  of      water,  12% said it was to go to the toilet,  and 83% said it  was      to go home.<FONT COLOR=red>

<P>
      A  funeral  service is being held for a woman who had just  passed      away.  At the end of the service the pall bearers are carrying the      casket  out  when they accidentally bump into a wall  jarring  the      casket.   They hear a faint moan.  They open the casket  and  find      that  the  woman is actually alive!
<P>
      She  lives for ten more years and then dies.  A ceremony is  again      held  at  the same place and at the end of the ceremony  the  pall      bearers  are again carrying out the casket.  As they  are  walking      the husband cries out, "Watch out<FONT COLOR=green>
