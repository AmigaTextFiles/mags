      Hitler and Stalin sit in a bar.
<P>
      This guy walks in and asks the barman.  Isn't that Hitler and Stalin?
<P>
      And the barman says "Yep, thats them"
<P>
      So the guy walks over and says:  "Hallo, what are you guys doing?"
<P>
      And  Hitler  says:"We're  planning  world war 3"
<P>
      And the guy says:"Really?  What's going to happen?"
<P>
      And Hitler says:" Well, we're going to kill 14 million Jews this time      and one bicycle repairman."
<P>
      And the guy asks:"A bicycle repairman???!"
<P>
      So  Hitler  turns  to  Stalin  and says:"See, I told you no-one would      worry about the 14 million jews!"

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      A couple, who have been married for 45 years decide to go back to the      cabin   where   they  had  their  honeymoon.   After  reaching  their      destination, the wife says to the husband.  "Sit down honey, I have a      surprise for you".  She returns in a transparent night gown and asks,      "Do you remember this darling?" "I sure do honey", he replies.
<P>
      She  asks, "Do you remember the words you said to me at first night?"      He said, "Sure do honey, I said I was going to suck your tits dry and      fuck  your  brains out." She immediately ripped off he gown and asked      "Well what do you think" He replied "Mission accomplished!"

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      An  elderly  woman goes to the doctor and asks his help to revive her      Husband's sex drive.
<P>
      'What  about  trying  Viagra?'  asks the doctor.  'Not a chance' says      Mrs.  Murphy.  "He won't even take an aspirin for a headache."
<P>
      'No problem,' replies the doctor.  'Drop it into his coffee, he won't      even taste it.  Try it and come back in a week to let me know how you      got on.'
<P>
      A week later Mrs.  Murphy returns to the doctor and he inquires as to      how things went.
<P>
      'Oh it was terrible, just terrible doctor.' 'What happened?' asks the      doctor.
<P>
      'Well  I did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee.  The effect      was  immediate.   He  jumped  straight  up, swept the cutlery off the      table,  at the same time ripping my clothes off and then proceeded to      make passionate love to me on the tabletop.  It was terrible.'
<P>
      'What  was  terrible?' said the doctor, 'was the sex not good?'.  "Oh      no  doctor, the sex was the best I've had in 25 years, but I'll never      be able to show my face in McDonald's again.
