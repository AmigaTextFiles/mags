<FONT COLOR=cyan>The  Convenience  Store  -  the cornershop.  Everyone's got one, quite localto  them, usually on the corner of theroad.    Always  there,  always  open,except when you run out of milk at 2amor  the  cat's  just come in and wantsfeeding, then they're closed.  We takethem  for  granted, and then moan whenthey   close   down  because  the  newsupermarket   that   opened   recentlythat's  about  2 miles away, has takenall  the custom, and they can't affordto compete and stay open.
<P>
It's  not  easy to run a little cornershop  - ask anyone who's tried it, andthey'll  tell  you  all  about  it.  Iknow,  I  manage one.  Let me give you
<P>
an  example  of a typical working day.Do  I  hear  you  say "That's boring"?Not likely.  Just try this for size.
<P>
The  shop opens from 7am until 10pm atnight,  every  day, seven days a week,all  year  round.  There's no rest forthe  wicked  -  just that I'd like theopportunity  to  be  wicked  once in awhile.  :-)<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
There  are  ten members of staff - TheManager  (me)  Assistant  Manager (whoknows  almost  as much as the manager,but  not  all)  Three Supervisors (whoknow  enough, but not everything) Fivecashiers  or  Sales Assistants as theyare properly known.  We work on a rotabasis  -  I  usually  manage to get atleast one day off a week.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  manager  opens  the  shop  in themorning.   They  are usually the firstto  arrive  (not always, we are human,and  can  oversleep,  just like anyoneelse!)   :-)   Followed   by  a  salesassistant,  who seem to be more human,and  do  oversleep.  We open the shop,switch  off  the  alarm  and fetch themorning papers in.  Easy?  Not always<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
-  this  morning,  the papers are lateand  are  not  where  they  should be.Then we have to wrestle with the safe.This  holds  the keys to everything inthe  shop;  the tills, the secure roomwhere   we  keep  the  cigarettes  andalcohol,  the  fire  exit  doors,  theshutters  which  cover  the windows atnight, the CCTV tapes, etc.  In short,the  keys  to  the  business.  Withoutthese  we  can't  open and trade.  Andthe safe is belligerent.  This morningit  doesn't  want  to  open.   It sitsthere,  and  sulks.   We  twiddle  thecombination,  we enter the sequence ofnumbers,   wind   it   back  to  zero,and.......   nothing.   We  try again,nothing.   No  click, not a sound.  Itjust sits there like a brick, but moreso.   Immovable, solid and closed.  Wecurse,   cagoule,  kick  it,  and  tryagain.  Nothing.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
We try nice words, soothing sounds andflattery,  all  to  no avail.  We havepeople  rattling  on  the  shop  door,waiting   for   their   papers,  earlymorning  cigarettes,  a  loaf of breadfor their little Johnny's pack up, andthe safe just sits there.  I'm sure itlaughs!   We  apologise  to  the iratepeople  and  tell  them  that  we  areunable  to  help  with  whatever  theywant,  as we can't open up, because wehave   an   evil  safe.   They  leave,grumbling - blaming US!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
We  go back to the safe, to try again.Now the paper delivery is at the door,and  we  have to stop and fetch it in.We  have  papers  - but we still can'topen.   The  kettle is switched on andwe  sneak  up  on  the safe to take itunaware.   It  works!   I've  got  thekeys.  Now to open everything, and getto work.  The bread delivery arrives -and  duly  off-loads.   With  a  briefexchange  about  the  weather,  or thequeues  on  the motorway, or a joke heheard down the pub last night, he's onhis way to the next drop.  We sort thebread onto the shelves.  Twenty loavesof bread that no-one buys, (because itfeels like a brick when it's fresh andit  has a three day sell-by date on itand  it  will feel more like lead whenit  reaches  that date), and seventeenthat everyone wants (because it's softand  squashy,  and  lasts  for about aweek),  enough  rolls to feed half thetown and three packs of teacakes.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Now  we managed to get that cup of teawe  put  the  kettle  on  for earlier,except  we  may  not  get  a chance todrink   it,   because   the  milkman'sarrived  and  unloading  50 cartons ofmilk  and  75 polybottles of the stuffwhich  looks  like milk, but tastes ofplastic,     and     usually    leaks.Everywhere.   Especially  over me.  Wehave  no  milk on the shelf, as it allwent   before   we  closed  the  nightbefore,   and   we  have  five  peoplewaiting  for  it  in the shop.  I openthe  warehouse door, and five pairs ofhands  grab a bottle - the same bottle-  and  a  fight ensues, which ends inthe  bottle  launching itself into theair   having  freed  itself  from  thehands,  (don't  ask  me  how,  it  allhappened  so  fast)  free-falling ontothe  floor,  and  exploding - all overme!   Milk is dripping from my hair, Ican't  see a thing through my glasses,except milk (oh, for windscreen wiperson  specs),  AND IT'S COLD!!!  There'smilk  on the ceiling and the floor andI've turned
 white and very wet.  Afterclearing   the  milk  from  my  specs,there's   not  a  customer  in  sight.They've all had a bottle of milk, paidfor it and left.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I'm still standing in shock, and milk,with  an  ever increasing white puddleat  my  feet.  It was only two litres,but  it  goes a very long way - exceptwhen  it's in YOUR fridge, and then itdoesn't!   Two  bowls  of  cereal, sixcups  of  tea  -  and it's gone.  On ashop floor it's a lake.  It laps up tothe  biscuit  shelves,  around  to thewashing powder, under the freezer, outthe  other side, skirts the Coke standand  reaches out for the beer, like analcoholic.   Abandon  milk trolley andfetch  mop  and bucket.  Try to ignorethe  giggling  cashier  and  the smartremarks from subsequent customers, andcontain  the  mess.  It was two litreswhen  it started, the mop bucket brimswhen I've finished, and it's not whiteanymore.   Now  I can dry off, and putthe milk on the chiller shelf where itshould  be.   My clothes dry stiff andsmell  unpleasant, and I can't go hometo  change  -  a pleasant start to theday - NOT.  Nothing else can go wrong,can it?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
 Wrong.   The  cashier  changes shift,(they  only  work  four  hours - luckythem  -  I'm  here  for  at  least  10hours).   They  exchange  the story ofthe  milk and the safe, more giggling,and  the  new  one  waits for the nextepisode.   It  can't  be long, can it?They're right, of course.  The groceryorder  arrives  and  it's time to fillthe  empty  spaces  in  the shop.  Thefirst  load  goes  out without mishap.But....   I'm filling the beer chillerwith  beer  cans  and  they fall over.They  don't  like  that  and pop open,spraying   their   contents  over  thechiller  door,  shelves and bottom....and  me!   I've  now  had a beer rinsethrough  my  hair,  so  I smell like abrewery  too.   Hello,  mop-bucket, myold friend!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Do I get sympathy?  No.  After a quickwash, I relieve the cashier, who can'tserve  for  laughing,  so she can calmdown.   After  half an hour, she comesback  to  the  till,  after having hadlunch,   a   cigarette,  two  cups  ofcoffee, another cigarette, a natter toa  few  customers,  who  no doubt havebeen  enlightened  about  the milk andthe  beer  and  the difficult safe.  Igive  the  safe a kick when I get backinto  the  office,  to clear the smirkwhich  I'm sure it's got.  It sits andsulks  again  when I need to get in todo  the banking.  Securicor are at thedoor,  waiting to collect the previousdays   takings,  which  I've  not  hadchance  to  sort  out.   Will the safeopen?   Not a chance.  While they waitfor me, they chat to the cashier...<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I'm  sure  he  stifled  a laugh when Igave  him  the  cash  bag.   The  nextcashier  and  the afternoon supervisorarrive  and the stories are exchanged.I   do  get  some  sympathy  from  thesupervisor,  and  I have some for her,too.   The  next  cashier  is  blonde,young,    and    thinks    she   knowseverything.   She's updated on the newstock   we've   had  in  -  disposablebarbecues.    These   things  are  thelatest in the company line - aluminiumtrays  filled with charcoal with addedlighter  fuel.   Remove  lid, throw inmatch and, hey presto, you're ready tostart  cooking.   Except about an hourlater,  I  hear  her  explaining  to acustomer   that  they  are,  in  fact,INDOOR    barbecues.     My   eyebrowsdisappear  into  hair  more like straw(from  the  effects of milk and beer),and  I'm totally speechless.  Luckily,the  supervisor  knows  too  well  thecashier's  brainless ideas, and calmlyinforms   the  customer  that  somehowthere     has     been     a    slightmisundersta
nding,  and are for outdooruse - ONLY.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I'm  imagining the evening papers withthe  headline  - House Barbecue CausesStreet  Blaze.   It's  not certain howmany  other  people have left with thesame  information,  so we have to takethem  off sale.  Just in case.  I graba sandwich to eat while I'm completingthe   paperwork   for   the  day,  andentering information onto the computer- no lunch break here for me.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
But  I  can never eat a whole sandwichwithout  interruption  - I am summonedto sort out complaints from customers,ranging   from   being  short-changed,over-charged,  buying  the wrong item,exchanging  faulty  or  damaged goods,and things like that.  After eating, Idecide   that  enough  misfortune  hashappened,  and  nothing  else  can  gowrong.   I decide to make a display bythe   till   of  boxes  of  chocolate,hopefully  to  encourage sales.  Afterhalf   an   hour's   work,   it  looksattractive,   and   the  staff  agree.Also,  the boxes are less likely to bestolen   by   the   local  shopliftingbrigade  as  they  are in full view ofstaff  and  customers.   Good idea, isthe  general view.  Not a good idea asit  turned  out.   No, they didn't getstolen.   Fate had a totally differentidea than that!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Sitting  down,  during my last hour ofmy  shift,  drinking a well earned cupof   coffee,   trying  to  ignore  theincreasing    smell    of    somethingreminiscent  of  a cow in a brewery, Ihear  a crash in the shop.  A distinctsound  of  breaking  glass.   A  quickglance  at  the CCTV confirms this.  Idash  out  onto  the shop floor and uptowards  the  till,  narrowly  missingcolliding  with the supervisor, movingequally  fast  towards  the storeroom.In  the  middle of a growing puddle ofsherry,  and shards of green glass, isan elderly gentleman, who, having justpurchased  his customary tipple of theshop's  own brand of cream sherry, hadmissed  his  pocket  and deposited thebottle   on   the  floor  -  liberallyshowering   my   latest   display   ofchocolates with the sherry.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  cashier offered him a replacementbottle,  and  his neighbour rushed in,guided  him  quickly out of the store,explaining  that it wasn't his turn tobuy  the sherry, it was her turn, justas  the  supervisor  returned with theever  faithful mop-bucket!  Stunned, Ifetched the waste-book, and a trolley,recorded the loss of a £2.99 bottle ofcream  sherry,  and  £92.46  of sherrysodden  boxes of chocolate, which weretransported into the stockroom.  I wasdefinitely  ready to go home, now, butI have to report a large stock loss toHead Office.  Phone in hand, I explainthe incidents of the day to some-one Ihave never met and report stock lossesdue  to  unforeseen  events  beyond mycontrol.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I   don't   think   she  believed  me.Eventually,  I  am  advised to dry outthe  chocolates - hopefully, it's justthe boxes which are wet, clean them upas  much  as  possible,  reduce reallydamaged  boxes  by 50p or charge extraand    call   them   Special   Liqueurchocolates  -  and  then  to  go home,clean  up and file a report by the endof the week.  I've been at work for 12hours  by  the time I finish the phonecall.   The  bit  about  "go  home andclean up" sounded very good - so I didjust that.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Never  has a bath sounded so inviting.After  the bath, and a meal, I'm readyfor  bed,  so I can be up at the crackof dawn the next day to start all overagain.   So, next time you are in yourlocal  corner  shop,  and the item youwant  isn't  in stock, and the managerlooks  harassed - stop and think - youcould  be  in my store and it could beme.   Why  do  I  do it, do I hear youask?   The  answer is simple - strangethough  it  may seem, I enjoy it - younever  know  what  the day will bring,good  or bad, and I do get a laugh outof it - and now, so do you.
