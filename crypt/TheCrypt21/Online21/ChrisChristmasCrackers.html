<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The wise old Mother Superior was dying.  The nuns gathered around her      bed, trying to make her comfortable.  They gave her some warm milk to      drink, but she refused it.
<P>
      Then  one  nun  took  the  glass  back to the kitchen.  Remembering a      bottle  of  whiskey  received  as  a gift the previous Christmas, she      opened  it  and poured a generous amount into the warm milk.  Back at      Mother Superior's bed, she held the glass to her lips.
<P>
      Mother  drank a little, then a little more, then before they knew it,      she had drunk the whole glass down to the last drop.
<P>
      "Mother,  Mother,"  the  nuns  cried, "Give us some wisdom before you      die!"
<P>
      She  raised  herself  up  in  bed  with  a pious look on her face and      pointing out the window, she said, "Don't sell that cow!"

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      A young man is sitting at his Mother's kitchen table, when he decides      to 'come out'.
<P>
      "Mum, I must tell you something."
<P>
      "Yes, what is it?" she replies, still stirring.
<P>
      "Well, I'm gay."
<P>
      "Oh yes?" replies Mother, without turning round.
<P>
      The  young  man  goes  quiet,  and waits for the parent to digest the      news.
<P>
      "Does that mean you suck other men's penises?" she asked, eventually.
<P>
      "Yes, it does."
<P>
      The mother walks over to the son, looks down and smashes him over the      head with the soup ladle.
<P>
      "Then  don't  you complain about my cooking any more!" she bellows in      his ear.<FONT COLOR=cyan>

      The  blonde  walks  into  a  pharmacy and asks the assistant for some      bottom  deodorant.  The pharmacist, a little bemused, explains to the      woman that they don't sell bottom deodorant, and never have.
<P>
      Unfazed,  the  blonde assures the pharmacist that she has been buying      the  stuff  from  this  store on a regular basis, and would like some      more.
<P>
      "I'm sorry," says the pharmacist, "we don't have any."
<P>
      "But I always get it here," says the blonde.
<P>
      "Do you have the container it comes in?"
<P>
      "Yes!" said the blonde, "I will go and get it."
<P>
      She  returns  with  the  container and hands it to the pharmacist who      looks at it and says to her, "This is just a normal stick of underarm      deodorant."
<P>
      The  annoyed  blonde  snatches  the container back and reads out loud      from the container, "To apply, push up bottom."

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company.  During      the  welcoming  ceremony the boss says:  "You're all part of our team      now.   You  can  earn  good money here, and you can go to the company      canteen for something to eat.  So don't trouble the other employees."
<P>
      The cannibals promise not to trouble the other employees.
<P>
      Four weeks later the boss returns and says:  "You're all working very      hard,  and  I'm  very satisfied with all of you.  One of our cleaners      has disappeared however.  Do any of you know what happened to her?"
<P>
      The cannibals disavow all knowledge of the missing cleaner.
<P>
      After  the  boss  has  left,  the leader of the cannibals says to the      others:  "Which of you idiots ate the cleaner?"
<P>
      A  hand raises hesitantly, to which the leader of the cannibals says:      "You  fool!  For four weeks we've been eating Team Leaders, Managers,      and Project Managers so no-one would notice anything, and you have to      go and eat the bloody cleaner!"

      BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>  is  a  revolutionary  technological breakthrough:  no wires, no      electric currents, no batteries.  Nothing to be connected or switched      on.  So easy to use, even a child can operate it!  Compact, portable,      it  can be used anywhere - even on a beach, yards from a power point.      Yet  it  is  powerful  enough to hold as much information as a CD-ROM      disc!  Here's how it works:<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>  is  constructed  of literally hundreds of sequentially numbered      sheets  of  paper  (recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of      bits of information.  The pages are locked together with a custom fit      device  (a  "binder")  which  maintains  each  sheet  in  its correct      sequence.
<P>
      Opaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows the manufacturer to utilize BOTH      sides  of each sheet, thus doubling information density while cutting      costs.
<P>
      Sheets are scanned optically, registering information directly to the      brain - the most efficient interface yet developed!
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      And simple:  a flick of a finger takes you to the next sheet!<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan> may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening it!<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>  never  crashes  or  requires  rebooting.   The "browse" feature      permits  you  to move instantly to any single sheet, AND move forward      and  backward  as  you wish.  Forget scrolling arrows or multiple key      commands!<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>  often  comes  with an "index" feature which pinpoints the exact      sheet location of any selected information for instant retrieval.
<P>
      An optional "<FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>mark" accessory allows you to open book at THE EXACT      PLACE  YOU  LEFT  IT IN A PREVIOUS SESSION ...  even if<FONT COLOR=yellow> BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan> has been      closed!
<P>
      Best  of  all, <FONT COLOR=yellow> BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>marks  fit  universal  design  standards ...  any      <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>mark can be used in any <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan> by any manufacturer!
<P>
      A  brand  new <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>mark can even be used in a <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan> that predates it by      months, even years!
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Should  you  wish  to store numerous views in a single book, multiple      <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>marks can be used.
<P>
      You  also  have  the  option to make personal notes next to <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan> text      entries  with  an  optional  programming  tool, Portable Erasable-Nib      Cryptic Intercommunication Language Stylus <FONT COLOR=red>(PENCILS)<FONT COLOR=cyan>.
<P>
      Portable,  durable,  and  affordable, <FONT COLOR=yellow> BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>  is  being  hailed as the      precursor  of  a  new information-delivery wave.  <FONT COLOR=yellow>BOOK<FONT COLOR=cyan>'s appeal is so      certain  that  thousands  of self-employed content creators (like me)      have  committed  to the platform, and edit technicians are evaluating      their submissions.
