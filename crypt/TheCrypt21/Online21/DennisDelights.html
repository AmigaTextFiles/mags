                                  The Cannibals<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Five cannibals get appointed as programmers in an IT company.  During      the welcoming ceremony the boss says to them, "You're all part of our      team  now.   You  can  earn  good  money  here, and you can go to the      company  canteen  for  something  to eat.  So don't trouble the other      employees." The cannibals promised they would not trouble anyone.
<P>
      Four  weeks later the boss returns and says, "You're all working very      hard,  and  I'm  very satisfied with all of you.  However, one of our      cleaners has disappeared.  Do any of you know what happened to her?"
<P>
      The  cannibals  claimed  that  they  had  no knowledge at all, of the      missing  cleaner.   After  the  boss  has  left,  the  leader  of the      cannibals demands, "Which of you idiots ate the cleaner?"
<P>
      A hand raises hesitantly, to which the leader of the cannibals snaps,      "You  fool!  For four weeks we've been eating Team Leaders, Managers,      and  Project Managers so no-one would notice anything, but you had to      go and eat the cleaner!"

<FONT COLOR=yellow>                            The Truth about Reindeers<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      According  to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, while both male      and  female  reindeer  grow  antlers  in  the  summer each year, male      reindeer  drop their antlers at the beginning of winter, usually late      November  to mid-December.  Female reindeer retain their antlers till      after  they  give birth in the spring.  Therefore, according to every      historical  rendition depicting Santa's reindeer, every single one of      them, from Rudolph to Blitzen- had to be a girl.  We should've known.      Only  women would be able to drag a fat-arse man in a red velvet suit      all around the world in one night and not get lost .

<FONT COLOR=yellow>                               Maxine and Samantha<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Maxine  and Samantha had not seen each other in many years.  Now they      had  a  long talk trying to fill in the gap of those years by telling      about  their lives.  Finally, Maxine invited Samantha to visit her in      her new apartment.
<P>
      "Come meet my husband and my three kids," she said. 
<P>
      "Great. Where do you live?" 
<P>
      "Here's  the  address.   And  there's  plenty  of  parking behind the      apartment.  Park and come around to the front door, kick it open with      your  foot,  go  to  the elevator and press the button with your left      elbow,  then enter.  When you reach the sixth floor, go down the hall      until you see my name on the door.  Then press the doorbell with your      right elbow and I'll let you in."
<P>
      "Okay,  But  why all this business of kicking the front door open and      pressing elevator buttons with my elbows?"
<P>
      "Surely you're not coming empty-handed!" 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=yellow>                                     Viagra<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  man  fell asleep on the beach under the noonday sun and suffered a      severe  sunburn  and  heatstroke.  He was taken to the hospital where      his  skin was a bright red, painful and started to blister.  Anything      that touched him caused agony.
<P>
      The  attending  Doctor  prescribed  continued  intravenous feeding of      water and electrolytes, a mild sedative and Viagra.
<P>
      "What good will Viagra do him in that condition" the nurse inquired.
<P>
      "It will keep the sheet off of him."
