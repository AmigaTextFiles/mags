      MAKING COFFEE<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Making  a  cup  of  coffee  is like making love to a beautiful woman.      It's  got  to  be  hot.  You've got to take your time.  You've got to      stir...gently, and firmly.  You've got to grind your beans until they      squeak.  And then you put in the milk.<FONT COLOR=white>

      LAYING A CARPET<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Laying  a  carpet  is...   very  much like making love to a beautiful      woman.   You  check the dimensions, lay her out on the floor, pin her      down, nail her, then walk all over her.  If you're adventurous - like      me - you might like to try an underlay.<FONT COLOR=white>

      HANGING WALLPAPER<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Well,  hanging  wallpaper  is  also  very  much like making love to a      beautiful  woman.  Clean all the relevant surfaces, spread her out on      the  table,  cover  her with paste, and stick her up.  Then you clean      your brush, light your pipe, stand back and admire your handiwork.

<FONT COLOR=white>      PUTTING UP A TENT<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Putting  up  a tent, is...  very much like making love to a beautiful      woman.   You  rent her, unzip the door, put up your pole an'...  slip      in to the old bag.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      WASHING A CAR<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Washing  a  car,  is very much like making love to a beautiful woman.      You've  got  to caress the bodywork.  Breathe softly and gently.  And      give  every  inch  of it your loving attention.  And make sure you've      got a nice wet sponge.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      BEING IN THERAPY<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      And  yet, having therapy is very much like making love to a beautiful      woman.You...   get on the couch, string 'em along with some half-lies      and evasions, probe some deep dark holes, and then hand over all your      money.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>      BEING IN A CRASH<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Going to the brink of death and back, in a nine car pile-up on a dual      carriage-way, is...  very much like making love to a beautiful woman.      First  of all, brace yourself, hold on tight - particularly if it's a      rear-ender.   And pray you make contact with her twin airbags as soon      as possible.<FONT COLOR=white>

      GOING FISHING<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Going  fishing  was  very much like making love to a beautiful woman.      First of all, clean and inspect your tackle, carefully pull back your      rod cover, and remove any dirt or gunge that may have built up whilst      not in use.  Then, extend your rod to its full length, and check that      there  are no kinks or any wear.  Particularly at the base, where the      grip  is  usually  applied.  Make sure you've got a decent float, the      appropriate bait, and that there's plenty of shot in your bag.
