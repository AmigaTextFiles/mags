<P align=justify>
      The WoAse2002 show took place in possibly the most expensive and posh
      place...oops,  err,  took  place  in  the  semi-peaceful  village  of
      Shenfield,  Brentwood  (just  east of London), in the UK.  Little did
      they  expect  the  onslaught  of  visitors, although maybe they did -
      which would explain the prices.
<P align=justify>
      Anyway,  the  show was a great opportunity to meet people and see new
      Amiga  stuff.   Or  not, in the latter case.  After meeting up with a
      few  people  who had only previously met through the internet<br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic2thumb.jpg" alt="pic2thumb.jpg (24316 bytes)" width=320 height=213><br>
      (L-R:   Niclas, Bal, Martin, Peter, Fredrik, Mike, Robert, Carl, some
      from   http://www.snarl-up.com)   outside  the  great  looking  venue
      (Poplars Hall, Hutton) <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic1thumb.jpg" alt="pic1thumb.jpg (23437 bytes)" width=320 height=209><br>
      we went inside thinking we had arrived
      quite  early.  Giving our tickets to the guys on the front desk (poor
      Bruce Steers was stuck there for three and a half hours - at least he
      got  to  meet  everyone at the show ;) we went into the maini hall to
      find it was packed.  Completely.  It did not make for easy navigation
      of  the  exhibitors,  especially for Cartmanesque people like me (not
      fat,  just  big-boned  ;).  The crowd lightened up towards the end of
      the show, which made it look pretty empty, especially compared to the
      sea of bodies which were there at the start.
<P align=justify>
      Working  round  the  hall  from  the door and going clockwise you had
      these tables:
<P align=justify>
      Hyperion  Games  Area (http://www.hyperion-entertainment.com).  There
      were  two machines, presumably networked, which I think were supposed
      to  be  running  Shogo.   Or  at least, one of them was (a nice A3000
      which rebooted with a MorphOS logo?!?!  - honest, it locked up on me,
      I  didn't  crash  it).   The other just sat showing the Workbench for
      most of the show.  There didn't appear to be anyone running the table
      which  wasn't very useful - trying to play Shogo with no instructions
      or  idea  of  what's happening is not the easiest thing in the world.
      It  was  compounded by the fact I was crap at it :) However, it was a
      very impressive piece of software, extremely smooth in 800x600.
<P align=justify>
      Next  round  the  wall  was Kicksoft (http://www.kicksoft.co.uk), the
      commercial   spin-off   from  Kickstart  which  sells  serious  Amiga
      applications  and  utilities.   They  must  have done fairly well, as
      their  table  was busy right until the end of the show.  Software was
      on sale, as well as a couple of Amigas running demos of the software,
      PageStream  (I  think)  was  proving  a  popular  demo with some neat
      effects and tricks being shown.
<P align=justify>
      Beside  Kicksoft  were  Pagan  Games (http://www.pagan-games.com), an
      Amiga,  AmigaDE  and  Mac  game company.  Their stand was quite empty
      ic  3  but  they  were selling Earth2140 and Blobula, their first
      AmigaDE  game.   Demos  of  both games were playing on a PPC equipped
      Amiga  and  a  laptop  (using  the  DE  Player)  respectively.   They
      eventually  brought  over  a very cool looking PDA to play Blobula on
      too.   Earth2140  was a very nice game - a real time strategy, in the
      same style as Dune2 or any of it's sequels (that's the first time I'd
      seen  it).  Blobula was OK, but the controls were very awkward on the
      laptop  and  not  much better on the PDA.  They were also advertising
      for  their  next AmigaDE game, Quingle (which wasn't explain since it
      was  top  secret  or  something).   Thomas  Wurgler, who was floating
      between  stands, also very kindly showed me a demo of the Mac version
      of  Dafel:   Blooodline, which has been in development almost as long
      as  Amiga hasn't been owned by Commodore.  It's impressive stuff, and
      the  Amiga  version is in a similar state.  Still a fair bit off, but
      progressing  -  hopefully  Pagan will get the reward they deserve for
      sticking  with it for such a long time.  The picture shows one of the
      Pagan  team  (sorry,  I  forgot  your name :), part of the advert for
      Quingle,  Bloodline  running  on  the  smart  Mac, and Blobula on the
      laptop with DE player. <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic3thumb.jpg" alt="pic3thumb.jpg (15215 bytes)" width=320 height=203>
<P align=justify>
      The  next table contained the Huddersfield and Blackpool user groups.
      They  were  sneaking  out  adverts  for the next big UK show - Son of
      Alt-WOA  2002  (http://www.alt-woa.org)  -  and  loitering around for
      general  Amiga  chit-chat.  Sounds like it will be another good show,
      and  if  they're  lucky,  they  might  have  AmigaOne  and  OS4.  The
      Blackpool  representative warned me that they were already practising
      for  the  SOAW2002  Sensi  tournament  -  but personally I think they
      should be banned, since they are organising it ;)
<P align=justify>
      The  two  tables  to  the  side of HAUG/BP were empty.  Some PC/Amiga
      dealer  and  Elbox  never turned up.  People seemed plenty willing to
      buy  some Elbox gear, especially Mediator related, thanks to the free
      advertising they were getting (as you'll see later).
<P align=justify>
      After  the  two  empty  tables  was  the Amiga (http://www.amiga.com)
      stand.    Present   were   Matthew   Killie,  developer  with  Zeoneo
      (http://www.zeoneo.com),  and  Fleecy  Moss <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic4thumb.jpg" alt="pic4thumb.jpg (14439 bytes)" width=320 height=210><br>  There were a
      couple  of  laptops  running the DE Player, demoing the early AmigaDE
      games.  One was Blobula (see the Pagan info) and the other was Planet
      Zed <br><IMG src="Images/pic5thumb.jpg" alt="pic5thumb.jpg (11834 bytes)" width=320 height=214><br>
       a very Xenon2 inspired game, which is no bad thing.  The
      graphics  were  good  and  the gameplay very smooth.  Unfortunately I
      tried playing it one handed due to all the stuff I was carrying which
      made  it  a  bit more difficult :) Mattew Killie confirmed what I had
      asked  Pagan  about developing AmigaDE games - that there are still a
      fair  few  parts missing.  Both companies have had to write their own
      graphics  drawing  routines for example.  On hearing a possible black
      mark  against  the  DE,  Fleecy  chirped in that there would be a new
      version  of  the  Amiga  DE  soon  (preferring not to give any date).
      Fleecy also said that Amiga were co-operating with Elbox and Matay so
      that  OS4 (possibly not 4.0 though) would run on their PCI PPC cards.
      The  reason was because 4.0 still requires the Amiga custom chips and
      it  would  be  more  effort than it would be worth to get the PCI PPC
      cards  to access back across to the Amiga.  However, it was not ruled
      out completely, Fleecy saying that Elbox and Matay were free to write
      the  required  hardware  drivers  if  they  wanted.   OS4.2, which is
      supposed  to  be fully re-targetable (and will not require the custom
      chips)  was  recommended  as  the  first version of OS4 to appear for
      those cards.
<P align=justify>
      Cloanto  (http://www.cloanto.com)  were also at the show, in the form
      of  Michael  Battallina (the boss).  Amiga Forever 4 was on sale at a
      real  knock  down  price.   Mr Battallina gave a presentation <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic6thumb.jpg" alt="pic6thumb.jpg (12784 bytes)" width=320 height=204><br>
      later  in  the  afternoon  showing the upcoming Amiga Forever 5.  The
      main  improvements  seemed  to  be  newer versions of the emulations,
      which    were   a   lot   faster.    Using   PPaint   as   the   test
      (loading/remapping/resizing  a large JPG image) the new emulation was
      about 70 times faster.  Nice.
<P align=justify>
      Eyetech  (http://www.eyetech.co.uk) had the large stand in the middle
      of  the  floor.   They  were  selling  most  stuff they have, but not
      everything.   Still,  most  people  at the show had one of the yellow
      Eyetech  bags,  which were pretty funky by themselves ;) On show, but
      not  in  an official kind of way with explanations and such, were the
      non-working AmigaOne boards.  One was a fully populated board and the
      other  was in a tower with a few connectors in place, showing how the
      A1200  connected  to it.  Quite a neat layout, but of course we don't
      want to see non working boards.<br><IMG src="Images/pic8thumb.jpg" alt="pic8thumb.jpg (20550 bytes)" width=320 height=214><br>
      In  the  middle  of  the  left  side  of  the hall were Weird Science
      (http://www.weirdscience.co.uk)        and       Stellar       Dreams
      (http://www.stellardreams.co.uk).   Both were selling vast quantities
      of  Amiga CD software.  Stellar Dreams (someone had a sleepless night
      after  some  beer?   ;)  also had large stacks of older Amiga stuff -
      various  magazines,  Amiga 500's  and even had a CD32 (that's also the
      first time I've seen one of them) showing some Star Trek video on CD.
<P align=justify>
      The   next   stand   round   the  wall  from  Eyetech  were  Forematt
      (http://www.forematt.co.uk) and                  100%           Amiga
      (http://www.100PercentAmiga.org).  Forematt had a very wide selection
      of   Amiga   titles,   old  and  new.   There  was  a  demo  of  Aqua
      (http://www.telusplanet.net/public/samel)  running  on  an  Amiga  on
      their  stand,  which  is  similar  in style to Myst.  100% Amiga were
      selling  subscriptions to their CD based magazine, made unique by the
      fact  that  all  articles are presented like news items from TV, with
      full  video  and audio.  Sadly, you need to run it through the custom
      chips as it uses CanDo and Scala.
<P align=justify>
      The  final  four  tables  were  the tables of the user groups who had
      organised  the show.  SEAL (http://www.seal-amiga.co.uk) were selling
      subscriptions to Clubbed at some ridiculously low price.  They should
      have done a roaring trade with that, and for the fact the magazine is
      rather  excellent.   ANT  were running some video presentations about
      their  user  group,  and were using some cool flat LCD monitors.  The
      Kickstart  tables  were empty, apart from some of the members hanging
      around  near  it  and  ASA  were  selling second hand Amiga hardware.
      However,  a  big  thanks  must  go  out  to all the groups and people
      involved in organising the show - it was excellent.
<P align=justify>
      I'm  not  sure what the next table was part of, it may have been ASA,
      but  the  chap  running it was Steve Evans.  On display was a big box
      Amiga     running     a     couple     of    copies    of    dynAMIte
      (http://amisource.de/dynamite) for people to blow each other up with.
      It  would  have  been  running  on  a  network  but for some ethernet
      problems  with the PC.  Typical ;) The other two computers there were
      a   PC   showing   the   Online   version   of   the  Crypt  magazine
      (http://www.thecryptmag.com),  and an A1200 showing the Amiga version
      of the Crypt in it's complete glory.  The picture shows how much work
      Steve  Evans done all day!  Actually he was quite busy for the entire
      show,  blagging  people  to  read the Crypt and play dynAMIte, and of
      course all the people who just dropped by for a chat. <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic9thumb.jpg" alt="pic9thumb.jpg (16532 bytes)" width=320 height=203><br>
      First stand in the middle set of tables of the right half of the hall
      was Virtual Programming and Amiga Active (http://www.amigactive.com).
      Virtual Programming were selling and demoing AmigaOSXL and Payback by
      Apex-Designs  (http://www.apex-designs.net).  Or they were once James
      Daniels  went  home  and  picked  up the CDs he forgot - doh!  In the
      picture  you  can see James (dark blue shirt) after mangling the poor
      guy in the Skid Row t-shirt in a Payback rampage. <br>
       <IMG src="Images/pic10thumb.jpg" alt="pic10thumb.jpg (12848 bytes)" width=320 height=213><br>
      They were also  being  very  secretive  about  what they were doing, apart from
      saying  they were porting WO2097 and Payback to the Mac, and "there's
      a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes".
<P align=justify>
      AA  were  selling  nearly  every  issue  they had, as well as calming
      people's rage about the change to digital.  For those who still don't
      know,  it's  going  to concentrate on non-Amiga specific stuff due to
      lack  of  any  new  Amiga gear.  This also means that Amiga stuff has
      been  dropped  from  the  mag,  but  if  a good enough new product is
      released,  it would still get reviewed.  The style of the mag will be
      the  same  as  the  current  middle  section  (the  NextGen section).
      Digital  will  be  entering  a new market by itself, no other current
      magazine  focuses on the same content they will be covering - it will
      not  just be another technology magazine which reviews the latest mp3
      player  or  mobile  phone.   Apart  from  that,  details  weren't too
      specific.   Guess  we'll just need to wait for the first issue to hit
      the  shelves  in  a  few  weeks  time.  Sharing the AA stand was Bill
      Hoggett,     running     a     demo     machine     with     Amithlon
      (http://www.amithlon.net)  on it. <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic11thumb.jpg" alt="pic11thumb.jpg (11083 bytes)" width=320 height=212> <br>
      He was allowing people to
      install  software  for  test  purposes, but it turned out most people
      were  happy  with  just  chatting to him about it.  Fortunately I had
      come  prepared  >)  and  had  some  software  to test.  Here's Scalos
      (http://www.scalos.com)  running on Amithlon <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic12thumb.jpg" alt="pic12thumb.jpg (11469 bytes)" width=320 height=202><br>
      Seems I broke some files at home before copying it onto CD :(
<P align=justify>
      Next     round     the     table    was    the    Mediator    support
      (http://www.amiga-mediator.co.uk)  guys  (and gals) giving Elbox some
      great  free  advertising.   There  was  a  couple  of  machines  with
      Mediators  (one  was  actually  from the Gloucestershire Amiga Group)
      filled  with  TV cards, sound cards, graphics cards, etc.  Sam Thomas
      was  playing  DVDs through the TV card and the soundcard outputs were
      going  to the mother of all amps.  The GAG Amiga was playing Worms on
      another  Amiga through the TV card.  Both were drawing plenty of oohs
      and  ahhs  from  the crowd, but obviously not for the neatness of the
      tower contents<br>
       <IMG src="Images/pic13thumb.jpg" alt="pic13thumb.jpg (21700 bytes)" width=210 height=320> <br>
      Early  on in the day I had signed up for the Sensi Soccer tournament,
      being played through a big- screen projector.  Not sure how much of a
      coincidence  it was, but it was right next to the bar.  Hmmmm.  After
      a  couple  of other games had been played, I got my chance to sink or
      swim  -  Aberdeen (me) versus the Arsenal.  Nerve jangling wasn't the
      word,  because  it's two.  End to end play, although most of the play
      centred  around  the  Aberdeen  defense showing it's usual ability to
      give the ball away and not get it back any time soon.  Still, I had a
      few  decent breaks and scored from a corner midway through the second
      half.   I  managed  to hold on until the end of the game - 1-0 to the
      Arsenal  it  wasn't.   Would have been more if I didn't stupidly pick
      the  zipstick  as my weapon of choice ;) You can maybe see the result
      in  all  it's  glory in the picture, if you strain your eyes and know
      some  Voodoo magic <br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic14thumb.jpg" alt="pic14thumb.jpg (8581 bytes)" width=320 height=212><br>
      Anyway, play continued while I wondered
      around  the  main hall again.  Unfortunately, the PA system was quiet
      at  best,  and so I missed the call to my second round game - robbed!
      It  was  probably for the best as I'm not much use on my 68k Amiga :)
<P align=justify>
      The  presentations  took  place  towards  the end of the show, again,
      handily  located  right  next to the bar.  I'm sure there were people
      who  didn't go near the main hall the whole day.  First up was Robert
      Williams     (from    Clubbed    -    Seal's    quarterly    magazine
      http://www.seal-amiga.co.uk).   After  doing  the  usual  thanking of
      people,  he explained the changes to Clubbed (provoked by the changes
      to  AmigaActive).   From  issue  10,  it  will  be called Total Amiga
      Magazine  (personally  I  prefer Clubbed (seals)) and will be brought
      out bi-monthly.  Having a few of their previous issues I can say that
      it  should  be  a  high quality magazine, every big as good a read as
      commercially published titles.
<P align=justify>
      Next up was Alan Redhouse, who I don't actually remember saying much,
      other  than  they  had  signed a contract with Amiga Inc and would be
      continuing the AmigaOne.
<P align=justify>
      Fleecy  was  on  the  stage  soon  after,  and  explained the current
      situation  of  Amiga  Inc and the reasons behind the contracts.  They
      were  contracting  to  allow  the work on the AmigaOne and OS4 (under
      Hyperion)  to progress more quickly and allow Amiga to focus on their
      real goal - the DE.
<P align=justify>
      After  the  presentations,  there  was  a raffle for various bits and
      pieces  people  had donated.  Fleecy drew the winners and picked more
      people  who  had left the show than were still there.  Still, quite a
      few people won stuff, including Mike and Fredrik.
<P align=justify>
      Following the raffle, plenty of people trooped out to the car park to
      laugh at Paul Quireshi's collection of Steps and Take That mp3s.  But
      he  didn't  have  any, so we just had to settle for an explanation of
      his  Amiga  based  in-car  MP3  player (http://amimpc.world3.net).  A
      genuinely  impressive  piece of Amiga hardware and software, all made
      by  Paul.   The  system  works  really well, and has some neat tricks
      (PFS3  formatted  hard  drives :) so that it can continually save the
      position in a track (without validation probs) for starting where you
      left  off.   Contender  for  the "Most impressive piece of Amiga gear
      that  was  actually  released  this  year" award.  You can see in the
      first  picture  the front panel for the system which actually fits in
      the  radio  slot of the dashboard.<br>
      <IMG src="Images/pic15thumb.jpg" alt="pic15thumb.jpg (12244 bytes)" width=320 height=203> <br>
      The second picture shows
      the main part of the hardware, sitting in the boot of the car.<br>
