      <font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever  notice computers as depicted in movies? You computer  guru's
      will  know  what  I'm  talking about...  not sure  about  everyone
      else... Here are some things to watch for...</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Word processors never display a cursor.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">You never have to use the space-bar when typing long sentences.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">All monitors display inch-high letters.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High-tech computers,  such as those used by<font color=white> NASA<font color=aqua>, the<font color=white> CIA<font color=aqua>, or some
      such  governmental  institution,  will  have  easy  to  understand
      graphical  interfaces.  Those that don't have incredibly  powerful
      text-bases  command  shells  that  can  correctly  understand  and
      execute commands typed in plain English.  Corollary:  You can gain
      access  to  any information you want by simply typing<font color=yellow> "ACCESS  ALL
      OF THE SECRET FILES"<font color=aqua> on any keyboard.  Likewise,  you can infect a
      computer with a destructive virus by simply typing<font color=yellow> "UPLOAD  VIRUS"
      <font color=white>(see "Fortress" or "Independence Day")<font color=aqua>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">All  computers  are connected.  You can access the information  on
      the villain's desktop computer, even if it's turned off.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Powerful  computers beep whenever you press a key or whenever  the
      screen changes.  Some computers also slow down the output  on  the
      screen  so  that  it  doesn't go faster than you  can  read.   The
   <font color=red>   *<font color=aqua>really<font color=red>*<font color=aqua>  advanced  ones also emulate the sound  of  a  dot-matrix
      printer.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  computer panels have thousands of volts and flash  pots  just
      underneath the surface.  Malfunctions are indicated  by  a  bright
      flash,  a puff of smoke, a shower of sparks, and an explosion that
      forces you backwards.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> People  typing away on a computer will turn it off without  saving
      the data.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> A  hacker  can get into the most sensitive computer in  the  world
      before intermission and guess the secret password in two tries.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Any <font color=yellow> PERMISSION  DENIED<font color=aqua> has an<font color=yellow> OVERRIDE<font color=aqua> function<font color=white> (see  "Demolition
      Man" and countless others)<font color=aqua>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complex calculations and loading of huge amounts of data  will  be
      accomplished in under three seconds.  Movie modems usually  appear
      to transmit data at the speed of two gigabytes per second.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When  the  power plant/missile site/whatever overheats,   all  the
      control panels will explode, as will the entire building.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">If  a  disk has got encrypted files,  you are automatically  asked
      for a password when you try to access it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter what kind of computer disk it is,  it'll be readable  by
      any system you put it into.  All application software is usable by
      all  computer  platforms.  The more high-tech the equipment,   the
      more  buttons it has<font color=white> (Aliens)<font color=aqua>.  However,  everyone must have  been
      highly trained, because the buttons aren't labelled.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most computers,  no matter how small,  have reality-defying three-
      dimensional,    active   animation,    photo-realistic    graphics
      capability.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Laptops,   for some strange reason,  always seem to  have  amazing
      real-time video phone capabilities and the performance of  a  CRAY
      Supercomputer.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Whenever a character looks at a VDU,  the image is so bright  that
      it projects itself onto his/her face<font color=white> (see "Alien", "2001")<font color=aqua>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So here I am sitting, Looking at my sad A1200, and wondering whats
      wrong with it, Why is it not like other Computers?</P>
