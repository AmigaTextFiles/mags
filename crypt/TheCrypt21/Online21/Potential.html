<FONT COLOR=red>                              <H1><CENTER>The Full Potential</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Well! ... Do you use your Computer to its full potential? Some how      I doubt it (<FONT COLOR=white>Regardless of what machine you use<FONT COLOR=cyan>).
<P>
      You  know Its strange,  Most of us Buy a Car and say to ourselves,      Well I need one ...Either to get to my work,  For family trips, or      even  just for the weekly Shopping.  Nine times out of  ten,   all      these  things  could  be accomplished by using "Public  Transport"      However the benefits of owning a car is that your not tied down to      other peoples Timetables.  Suddenly before you know it the Car has      become a vital ingredient in your daily life.
<P>
      Now  when people Buy a Computer ...  What is their reasons?  ..The      main  one today is Internet access ...Great ...Up to date News  on      tap ...Does this mean we stop buying Newspapers?
<P>
      Perhaps  its Games ...Either for you or your children,  Maybe  You      have convinced yourself that (a) Your children need a computer for      their  School Work or YOU need it to handle your Finances or  even      Work at home.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Regardless of what excuses you make to yourself, At the end of the      day, Your computer will probably become VERY Under-used.
<P>
      I Have both an Amiga & PC lined up side by side,  Yes I have spent      a  lot of money ...Either in the Purchase of the Modern PC  or  in      the Constant Upgrading of the Amiga.  So how do I (<FONT COLOR=white>On a reasonably      tight Budget<FONT COLOR=cyan>) Justify the Expense.
<P>
      Easy! .... I make Money from the Computers, Just as in some of the      High  running costs of todays motoring can be off set by no longer      having to fork out high fares for public transport, A little extra      cash CAN be made from Your Computer (<FONT COLOR=white>Yes even an AMIGA<FONT COLOR=cyan>).<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Business Cards<FONT COLOR=white>:<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Almost  every Town Street will contain someone who runs their  own      Small  Business  ...Either the Man of the house running  a  carpet      cleaning  Company to a self Employed Painter &  Decorator  or  the      Female doing Dress alterations or catering.
<P>
      Designing/Printing Business cards is really Easy. I normally use a      DTP  Program like Pagestream but this can easily be done on a word      Processor like Wordworth and a good clipart CD.
<P>
      Simply draw out a box (<FONT COLOR=white>Business card size<FONT COLOR=cyan>)  install a nice border,      a  piece or Two of suitable clipart and the Persons/Companies Name      with Telephone Number. Print on to a high quality card and cut out      using a sharp craft knife and Steel Ruler.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Advertising Cards<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Really  the  same  as the Business cards but in a slightly  larger      format,  So the Person can leave them as free advertising in Shops      Notice boards etc.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Advertising Flyers<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Flyers advertising a Business are slightly different in that  they      are  normally produced on a full sheet of normal quality Paper  as      opposed  to  card.   With very little experience  a  high  quality      coloured Flyer can be designed and Printed, Good enough to impress      anyone.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Menu's<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Know anyone who runs a Home catering Business.  You know the  Type      that  will  happily deliver hot or cold food to your  door  for  a      party ..Or do your complete catering for a Birthday bash.
<P>
      You  can very easily produce very professional personalised  Menus      for such occasions.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Party Invitations<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Yes  you can buy these at most Stationary shops,  But for  a  nice      personalised  affect and Quality product you  can  achieve  a  lot      better by using your Computer.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Celebration Cards<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Cards  can  be done on any computer ...However the  high  cost  of      Printing  ..Compared to the low cost of buying them in  the  shops      means that Greeting cards should be done on a personal basis only.      It  would be impossible to cover the costs of printing some  20/30      cards    for   someone   else.    However   present   a   handmade      Christmas/Birthday card to someone and you would be  the  talk  of      the Town<FONT COLOR=white> :)<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Shop Advertisements<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Yes!   How many of us living well away from main Shopping  centres      receive  those horrible hand written "Special Offer"  flyers  from      our local shops.  Most shop keepers use those Letter stencils  you      draw around and then Photo copy the results (<FONT COLOR=red>YUK<FONT COLOR=cyan>)
<P>
      I  received one of these and within 20 minutes I had a  much  more      professional  Printout done.  The next day I presented  it  to  my      local Shopkeeper and asked him which HE Preferred.
<P>
      Now every month I print out One Shop flyer with his Special offers      (<FONT COLOR=white>In Colour<FONT COLOR=cyan>) he then gets them Photo Copied ...I get £5.00p<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Decorating Stencils<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Did  you  know  that  most Inkjet Printers can easily  print  onto      Transparencies.   Recently a friend was  looking  for  an  unusual      Stencil for decorating the Border of one of her Rooms.
<P>
      As  she  was  a  lover  of  Fushia's   I  printed  out  one  on  a      transparency film and with careful use of a sharp pointed scissors      and  craft  knife  easily  produced a stencil  that  she  used  to      "stipple" the design on to her walls<FONT COLOR=white> :)<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Disk/CD Labels<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Anyone  who have seen the Disk version of the CRYPT Magazine  will      know  that  we  print  our  own custom  Disk  labels.   This  easy      procedure  can  easily be adapted to the CD case inserts  or  even      Music Cassette inserts.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Odds & Sods<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  friend  of ours own and rent out a Studio Flat in Tenerife.   I      designed  and printed out a load of "Welcome" Tentcards  (<FONT COLOR=white>Left  to      welcome  the  Guests<FONT COLOR=cyan>)   and instructions  for  working  the  Water      heater/Shower etc.  (<FONT COLOR=white>These were printed on Gummed paper to  easily      stick onto Cupboard doors or walls<FONT COLOR=cyan>).<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      Conclusions<FONT COLOR=white> :<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Well no one is saying that You will become a multi millionaire  by      trying  some of these ideas.  However you may just make  a  little      extra  cash  from  your computer and have a lot  of  creative  fun      during the process.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      Note<FONT COLOR=white>:<FONT COLOR=cyan> Most of these projects can be done on a Good word processor,      However  I do use Pagestream a dedicated DTP Package.  The  latest      Pagestream  (4)   will set you back £180 from  Haage  &  Partners!      However Older versions of Pagestream (2)  can be obtained  for  as      little as £25 and well worth the Money.
<P>
      The main difference is that Pagestream re-sizes graphics with very      little Distortion (<FONT COLOR=white>scaling does not produce the Jaggies<FONT COLOR=cyan>). Also the      Handling/Moving  of  Graphics  and  text  is  so  much  easier  in      Pagestream.
<P>
      Should  anyone  require a little more Information regarding  these      projects  or help with Pagestream please feel free to  contact  me      privately <FONT COLOR=white> anerret22.freeserve.co.uk><FONT COLOR=cyan> or at my postal  Address      (<FONT COLOR=white>See Submissions in the<FONT COLOR=red> CRYPT<FONT COLOR=cyan>) and I will gladly help.<FONT COLOR=green>
