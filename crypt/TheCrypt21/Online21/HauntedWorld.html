<FONT COLOR=yellow>           Lost Cave World<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The   Aborigines  of  Cape  York  havealways  believed  that  a vast, almostendless underground cave-world exists.Dangerous,  giant  man-like  creaturesand enormous reptiles are said to livethere.    Even   speceologiest   (caveexperts)  say that they often hear thehaunting  cries  and  wails  of large,mysterious  creatures  echoing throughthe  cave  systems.  Many people enterthe  caves never to return, so perhapsit's  not  surprising  that Aboriginesoften  refuse  to tell explorers wherethe secret entrances are.<FONT COLOR=yellow>

           The Bush Panther<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Hundreds   of  Australians  have  beenpetrified  by  encounters  with large,dangerous, cat-like carnivores.  Foundin  remote,  mountainous  places,  thepanther-like  beast  is said to be 2,3metres  long  with  smooth black hair,strong  legs  and  big  paws.   It haspricked-up  ears, yellow eyes and longflesh-tearing teeth.  The beast's prey-  cattle  and  other animals - alwayshas  fang-holes  at  the  back  of theneck.   Loud  howls  and  shrieks havebeen  heard,  and  huge pawmarks foundnear     the     ripped-up    remains.Scientists   say   that  the  pawmarksbelong  to no known species.  Evidenceof  large cats has never been found inAustralia.   The  creatures  have beenspotted  carrying  their  young  in  apouch,  so  they  could  be an unknownmeat-eating marsupial.<FONT COLOR=yellow>

             It's a Yowie<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Australia's  mysterious  Big-foot-likecreature  is  called  a Yowie.  It wassighted  in  1912 in Bambal, New SouthWales.   Reports  of similar creaturesare often heard and it could have beena  Yowie  that  terrified  a  wildliferanger  in Queensland National Park in1978.    The  ranger  said  it  was  amassive  2.25  metres  tall, with darkhair, flat shiny face, big yellow eyesand  a  short,  thick  neck.  When theYowie realised it had been spotted, itlet  out  a smell so foul that it madethe  ranger  throw  up.   The creaturethen made a swift getaway.  The queasyranger, who used to think as the Yowieas  strictly  'comic-book  stuff', wasnow horribly certain of its reality!<FONT COLOR=yellow>

           The Booya Stones<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Stories  about the sacred booya stonesof  the Murray Islands, off Cape York,fascinated  Australian  travel  writerIoin  Idriess.  He discovered that thestones  had  been  handed down throughcountless  generations by the island'spriests.   Said to give out an intenseblue  light,  if  a  booya  stone  wasplaced  into  a  special  holder,  thelight  could  be  focused into a beam,like  a  ray gun.  Any human zapped bythe  beam would light up, just like anX-ray,  then die soon after.  When theEuropeans  arrived  in  Australia, thepriests hid the powerful booya stones.Today,  no-one  knows  or  will revealtheir  hiding  place, so the source ofthe  booya  stones'  power may foreverremain a mystery.<FONT COLOR=yellow>

In  1964,  Robert  le Serrec filmed anamazing  sea  monster  in  the shallowwaters  of  Hook  Island.   It  was atleast 20 metres long, with what lookedlike a gaping wound in its side.  Whenthe  monster raised it's gigantic headout   of  the  water,  Robert  stoppedfilming and faced away in a big hurry!Experts  say the creature looks like amonstrous  swamp  eel  but whatever itwas,  Robert  felt  he'd been lucky tosurvive the close encounter!<FONT COLOR=yellow>

In 1997, a huge 'globster' weighing ina   four  tonnes,  the  weight  of  anelephant,  was  found  washed  up on aTasmanian   beach.    Locals  said  itlooked  like  a  cross between a giantsquid    and   a   walrus.    It   hadpaddle-like  flippers,  was covered inspaghetti-like   hair  and  it's  headalone  measured  well  over  one metreacross.   Biologists  conducted  a DNAtest,  the  first ever to be performedon  a  globster, but remain baffled asto  it's  origin.  For the moment, theblob has joined the 'unexplained' filemarked 'Monsters of the Deep'.<FONT COLOR=yellow>

              Dreamtime<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Australia  is a fascinating continent,with  many  amazing  natural  wonders,which  tourists  shouldn't  miss.  Themost  famous is Ayers Rock.  The firstEuropean  to  see  the rock was ErnestGiles  in 1872.  A year later, WilliamGosse  climbed  it  and named it AyersRock  after  Sir  Henry Ayers, who wasChief  Secretary  of  South Australia.Australia  now  prefers it's Aboriginename  of Uluru.  The whole area aroundUluru   is   red   -  the  rock  showsdifferent hues of red depending on thetime  of  day,  from  a bright orange,through  to  a  burgundy at dusk.  Thesand surrounding the rock is also red,as  there  is  a  high  iron  content.Uluru  is  the  largest single rock inthe  world, at 348 metres high and 3.6km long.  It measures 8.8km around thebase.   It  is thought to continue for6km below the ground.  Aborigines havelived  around the rock for over 10,000years.  Now owned by the local Loritjaand    Pitantjatjara    tribes,    allAborigines  know it as the most sacredsite  in  A
ustralia.  Many Uluru caveshave  ancient  Aborigine  paintings ofthe   Dreamtime  which  they  considersacred.    Tourists  as  requested  torespect  this,  and keep away from theimages.  Aborigines believe the rocks,lakes and deserts of Australia tell ofthe Dreamtime, when spirits walked theEarth.  They believe these spirits arenot  dead,  but  sleeping,  under  theground  or  high above in the sky, andwatch  over the places and people theycreated long ago.  Each tribe has it'sown  Dreamtime stories which relate tothe    natural   features   in   theirlocality,  and  are passed on in wordsand  song  and  dance  rituals  calledcorroborees.   Each  area has it's owncave  paintings  and  rock engravings.The  Aborigines who live in around theNarran Lake in New South Wales believethe  world  was  made by two crocodilespirits.   When  the  spirits  ate thewives  of  a  local  hunter, he killedthem.   As they writhed around, dying,they made a giant hollow in the earth,this  filled with wate
r to become LakeNarran.   Uluru National Park also hasanother  rock  collection - the Olgas.There  are  30  or  more  domes, whichexperts  believe  may  have  been  onesingle  rock,  even bigger than Uluru,which over thousands of years has beeneroded by wind and rain.  Again, theirAboriginal name is Kata Tjuta, meaningmany  heads,  supposedly  representinggiants,  the  Pungalunga  Men, who ateAborigines  during  the Dreamtime age.They  get their modern name again fromErnest  Giles,  who named the largest,Mount    Olga,    after    a   Russiannoblewoman.<FONT COLOR=magenta>

Thunderstorms    can    be   a   scaryexperience for some, but in Te Ngaere,on  North  Island,  a family told of atruly scary experience during one.  Asa  thunderclap  shook  their  house, a'flow of light' came under their frontdoor.   It's  shape  kept changing, bywas  about  10cm long and 5cm wide andbluish  silver.  The family watched inhorror  as it flowed around some toolslying on the floor, looking and movingsimilarly   to   mercury,   or  moltensilver,  before  sliding out under thedoor  again.

        Cloudy Weather or Not?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Clouds  do  not always act in a commonway,  either.  We imagine clouds to beeither  the  fluffy,  cottonwool  typeforms we see on summer days, to thick,heavy  grey  clouds covering the skieson  winter  days, full of the prospectof  rain  or  snow.   There  are othertypes  less commonly seen though, likethe  cloud  one  night  in 1988, aboutwhich  a  fishing boat crew radioed totheir  local  coastguard station.  Thecrew reported that their boat had beenengulfed  by  a  vast,  sticky  cloud,which  was  made  up of floating whitestrands,   similar   to  cobwebs.   Itstretched  for many kilometres but hadcompletely  disappeared by morning thenext day.  No explanation has been putforward,   but  could  the  wind  havepicked  up some huge cobwebs somewhereand  carried them out to sea?  Anotherextraordinary  cloud  put on a displayover  Lake Taupo.  The cloud was blackand  swooped  around at speed over thelake   for  several  hours,  sometimesshooting  down  to  the surface of thewater  befo

       The Watcher at the Gate<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The Gilbert Islands lie in the PacificOcean  to the north-west of Australia.There are 24 islands in the chain, andthe  most  northerly  is  Makin-Meang.The  islanders regard Makin-Meang as ahalf-way  house between the living andthe  dead.  When an islander dies, hisghost  has  to  make  it's  way up thechain  of  islands to Makin- Meang, toland on the southern beach and walk upto  the  northern  end,  known  as thePlace  of  Dread, where the Watcher atthe  Gate,  Nakaa, sits in wait with anet in his hand to strangle the ghoststo  prevent  them  passing through theGate to Paradise.  The only assistancethe   ghost   can   get  is  from  hisrelatives  performing  certain ritualsover  his dead body, which should helpprevent Nakaa from trapping the ghost,so  enabling  the  soul  to  travel toParadise.   Depending  on which island<FONT COLOR=cyan>the person died on, the route from thesouth  to  the  north takes either thewest  side  of the island for the deadfrom the other islands, or the e
asternside for native Makin-Meang islanders.As  there  is higher traffic of ghostson  the eastern side of the island, ifyou  have  to walk from one end of theisland  to the other, take the easternside,  having  first checked if anyoneis likely to die during your trip, andyou   should  have  a  lower  risk  ofmeeting  ghosts  on  the  way.  If youhave  to walk on the western side, youshould  never  look back, for the riskof  seeing  a ghost going the same wayas  you.   If  you  see  a ghost whilelooking  behind  you,  legend says youwill  be  dead  within a year!  ArthurGrimble  became  a District Officer inthe   Gilbert  Islands  in  1916.   Hedidn't  believe  a word of the legend,even  if  it  had been a legend for at<FONT COLOR=cyan>least  sixty  generations of islandersbefore  he  arrived  there.  As he wasbased  on  Makin-  Meang, he naturallybecame  curious.  The native islandersremained silent on the subject, but hefound  an  assistant  from  Tarawa whowould   tell   him,  altho
ugh  he  wasafraid,  but  who found a local policeconstable  who would show Arthur up tothe  Place  of  Dread.   The constableinsisted  that  as  Arthur  was  not alocal,  they  would  have to travel upthe  western  side  of the island, thesame way as the majority of the ghostsdid.  It was a long journey, and afterthey had been walking for an hour, the<FONT COLOR=cyan>constable  stopped  and told Arthur tofind  a  seed-coconut  and  hold it infront  of  him  in  both  hands and toplant  it  in Nakaa's grove as a gift.Arthur  had  to carry the enormous nutfor   another   5  miles,  until  theyarrived  at  a  place  where the treesended, just before the northern beach.There  he  was  told to plant it.  Theconstable   refused  to  continue  anyfurther, and told Arthur he would haveto  go  on  alone  for the rest of theway.   Arthur  went  on  alone and wasvery disappointed.  He had expected tofind  something  eerie,  but the beachwas  just sand and bare rock, and veryhot.   When  Arthur 
 returned  to  theconstable,  he  was  grumpy  and  verythirsty.  As he hadn't been there verylong,  he had not learned how to climba  tree to reach the coconuts to drinkfrom, so he asked the constable to getone  for him, who refused as the trees<FONT COLOR=cyan>belonged to Nakaa.  The constable justwanted to be away as soon as possible.Arthur grumbled some more - it had allbeen a waste of time - nothing to see,and  now  he  was very thirsty indeed.They  started  back  down  the easternpath,   with   the   constable  behindArthur, as he now refused to walk withhim.   Before long, Arthur saw anotherislander walking towards them.  He wasabout fifty, had a bad limp due to hisfoot  being twisted, and had a scar onhis  left  cheek.   He  was  wearing adecorated  mat  held  by a belt aroundhis  waist.   Arthur  spoke  to him asthey  passed, but the villager ignoredhim.   Arthur  turned to the constableand asked him to stop the man, but theconstable  said he couldn't see anyonethere.   When 
Arthur insisted that theman   had   passed   them   both,  theconstable  began  to  scream and sweatprofusely.   He  put  his arm over hiseyes  and  ran  off  into  the  trees.<FONT COLOR=cyan>Arthur had to continue the walk on hisown.    When  Arthur  arrived  at  thevillage,  hot,  thirsty  and cross, hefound   the  constable  already  theretalking   to  the  Native  Magistrate.Arthur  went over to complain that theconstable had tried to make him look afool  by  pretending not to see anyoneon the path.  The Magistrate was calm,and  asked  Arthur to describe the manhe had seen.  He then explained that avillager  had  died  about  two  hoursbefore, unexpectedly.  Arthur insistedon  seeing the body, which, after someargument,  was  finally arranged.  Thebody lay in the village, surrounded bypeople  sitting with their arms raisedboth  at the head and feet of the deadman.  Other villagers were beating thewalls  of  the  dead  man's house withsticks,   to   frighten  away  strangeghosts. 
  It  was  the  same  man thatArthur  had seen whilst walking.  That<FONT COLOR=cyan>was enough for him.  Legend or not, hewas  content to allow the villagers tocontinue  with  their rituals to allowthe  man  to  escape the net of Nakaa,and  he  was  never  heard to ridiculetheir customs again.<FONT COLOR=yellow>

When  Tom landed at Sydney Airport, hewas full of both excitement and dread.He  was looking forward to meeting hiscousin  Dan  for  the  first time, butterrified  at  the  prospect of comingface  to face with a poisonous spider.Tom  hated  spiders  and had heard allabout  the  Australian red-back, whichhad   15   times  more  venom  than  arattlesnake, and the Sydney funnel-webspider,  which  had absolutely no fearof  people.   On the way home from theairport,  Dan  warned  him  always  tocheck under the toilet-seat and to runfor  his  life if he ever came face toface    with   a   spider.    "They'repractically   all  poisonous  in  thiscountry."  he  said.   Tom  took greatcare  where-ever  he went.  He checkedand  double-checked  in  his shoes, inhis bed and under the toilet-seat.  Totry  to get him to relax and enjoy hisholiday,  Dan  offered to lend Tom hisprecious    Porsche   for   the   day.Naturally,  Tom  set  off  to  see thecity.   He  was just starting to relaxand  enjoy 
 himself  when,  all  of  asudden, his worse nightmare came true.An  enormous, hairy, ferocious-lookingspider with beady black eyes and sharpfangs leaped on to the dashboard.  Tomlet   out   a   gigantic  scream  and,remembering  what his cousin had said,jumped  out  of  the car whilst it wasstill  moving.   Landing spread-eagledon  the ground, Tom watched helplesslyas  the  Porsche  swerved off the roadand  wrapped  itself round a lamppost.In  hospital later that day, Tom brokethe   bad   news  to  his  cousin  anddescribed  his  would-be  attacker  ingreat detail.  Head in hands, a ratherdesperate Dan proclaimed, "That spiderwasn't  a  funnel-web.  It was a hairyHuntsman.   It is practically the onlyharmless spider in Australia!"<FONT COLOR=yellow>

             Hair Raising<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Some  decades  ago,  tall beehive hairfashions  were all the rage.  The hairwas  piled  high  on  top of the head,after  backcombing and applying massesof hair lacquer.  This was a job for aqualified    hairdresser,   to   avoiddamaging  the  hair  and  to  save armache,  as  these creations could reachquite   a   height!   Girls  slept  inheadscarves,    or   in   hair   cagesspecially   designed   to  keep  theseelaborate  styles  neat and undamaged.It   was   a   costly   exercise,   somaintaining  the  hair-do was of primeimportance, also it meant that washingand  brushing  just  didn't happen forweeks!   One  girl  in  Auckland,  NewZealand,  found  that having this sortof  creation could be a health hazard.Being  very proud of her new look, butshort  of  money,  she  plastered hairlacquer  on every day, until it becamealmost  solid  on  the outside.  Aftersome  time,  of  course, it started tolook very grubby.  Her friends startedto  tease  her and said they had begunto  hear  w
eird noises when they stoodclose  to  her.   Several  people saidthey   were   certain  they  had  seensomething  moving about in it!  Later,during  a  medical, a suspicious nurseprodded  the tatty beehive with a comband   received   a   very   unpleasantsurprise!   The  nurse nervously askedwhen  the  girl  had  last  washed andbrushed her hair.  After being told itwas  probably up to two months before,the  nurse  fetched an electric shaverand  began  shaving  the  poor  girl'shead!   Her  pride  and joy had turnedinto  a  cock-roach  nest!  She didn'thave  to  worry about hairdressers andthe cost for a long time after!
