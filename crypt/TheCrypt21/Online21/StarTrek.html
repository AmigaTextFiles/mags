     (Picard)  "Mr.   LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts      at finding a weakness in the Borg?  And Mr.  Data, have you been able      to access their command pathways?"
<P>
      (Geordi)  "Yes,  Captain.   In fact, we found the answer by searching      through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."
<P>
     Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the view-screen.>
<P>
     (Riker looks puzzled.) "What the hell is 'Microsoft'?"
<P>
      (Data  turns  to  answer.)  "Allow  me to explain.  We will send this      program,  for  some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command      pathways.   Once  inside  their  root  command  unit,  it  will begin      consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate."
<P>
     (Picard)  "But  the Borg have the ability to adapt.  Won't they alter      their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"
<P>
      (Data)"Yes, Captain.  But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a      new  version  of  itself known as an 'upgrade'.  The use of resources      increases  exponentially  with  each iteration.  The Borg will not be      able  to  adapt  quickly  enough.  Eventually all of their processing      ability  will  be  taken  over  and  none will be available for their      normal operational functions."
<P>
     (Picard)  "Excellent work.  This is even better than that 'unsolvable      geometric shape' idea."

      (Data)  "Captain, we have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the      Borg's command unit.  As expected, it immediately consumed 85% of all      available  resources.  However, we have not received any confirmation      of the expected 'upgrade'."
<P>
      (Geordi) "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and      CPU  capacity,  but  we  still  have no indication of an 'upgrade' to      compensate for their increase."
<P>
     (Picard)  "Data,  scan the history banks again and determine if there      is something we have missed."
<P>
      (Data)  "Sir,  I  believe  there  is  a reason for the failure in the      'upgrade'.   Apparently  the  Borg have circumvented that part of the      plan by not sending in their registration cards."
<P>
      (Riker)  "Captain, we have no choice.  Requesting permission to begin      emergency escape sequence 3F ...."
<P>
      (Geordi,  excited)  "Wait,  Captain!  Their CPU capacity has suddenly      dropped to 0%!"
<P>
      (Picard) "Data, what does your scanners show?"
<P>
      (Data,  studying  displays)  "Apparently  the  Borg  have  found  the      internal  'Windows'  module named 'Solitaire', and it has used up all      available CPU capacity."
<P>
      (Picard)  "Let's  wait  and  see how long this 'Solitaire' can reduce      their functionality."

<P>
      (Riker) "Geordi, what is the status of the Borg?"
<P>
      (Geordi)  "As  expected,  the  Borg  are attempting to re-engineer to      compensate  for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they      successfully  increase resources I have set up our closest deep space      monitor  beacon  to  transmit  more  'Windows' modules from something      called the 'Microsoft Fun-pack'.
<P>
      (Picard) "How much time will that buy us?"
<P>
      (Data) "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest      time span of 6 more hours."
<P>
      (Geordi) "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."
<P>
      (Picard) "Identify."
<P>
      (Data)  "It  appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft'      logo..."
<P>
      (Over  the  speakers)  "THIS  IS  ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT      FLAGSHIP  MONOPOLY.   WE  HAVE  POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF UNREGISTERED      SOFTWARE  IN  THIS SECTOR.  SURRENDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN AVOID ANY      TROUBLE.  YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY."
<P>
      (Data)  "The  alien  ship  has  just  opened  its forward hatches and      released thousands of humanoid-shaped objects."
<P>
      (Picard) "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft!"
<P>
      (Riker)  "My  God, captain!  Those are human beings floating straight      toward  the  Borg  ship  -  with no life support suits!  How can they      survive the tortures of deep space?!"
<P>
      (Data>)"I don't believe that those are humans, sir.  If you will look      closer  I  believe  you  will  see  that  they are carrying something      recognised by twenty-first century man as doeskin leather briefcases,      and wearing Armani suits."
<P>
      (Riker and Picard, together - horrified) "Lawyers!"
<P>
      (Geordi)  "It  can't  be.   All  the Lawyers were rounded up and sent      hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."
<P>
      (Data) "True, but apparently some must have survived."
<P>
      (Riker)  "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with      all types of papers."
<P>
      (Data)  "I believe that is known in ancient vernacular as 'red tape'.      It often proves fatal."
<P>
      (Riker) "They're tearing the Borg to pieces!"
<P>
      (Picard)  "Turn  the  monitors off, Data, I cant bear to watch.  Even      the Borg doesn't deserve such a gruesome death!"
<P>
      End.
