<body lang=EN-GB style='tab-interval:36.0pt'>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another ripper suite I use and gave a small description of
in an earlier issue is Simple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since this has been getting constantly updated, I thought I would
have another go at showing the program. As you can see the latest version on my
drive is now up to 4.5j. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>

</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The ripper is the fastest I have used and has a variety of
methods of encoding. I have been told by other users that it isn't particularly
fast on their machine, so your mileage may vary. I have an Athlon processor, so
maybe this can affect the results.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image004.jpg" alt="image004.jpg (24349 bytes)" width=554 height=453>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The interface for the ripper isn't particularly inspiring,
but looks can be deceiving!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the ripper configuration can be reached from the interface,
and its worthwhile having a quick look at them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image006.jpg" alt="image006.jpg (28855 bytes)" width=521 height=341>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The main option screen allows you access to how you wish
your CD drive to behave as well as the rest of the menus.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image008.jpg" alt="image008.jpg (23563 bytes)" width=521 height=341>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>This part has been really updated with loads more options on
the encoding side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can now use all the options above . I have found the
GOGO method<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the fastest for ripping and
encoding mp3, but I recommend you try out all the different methods for best
results. More file formats have been added as well as the different mp3
encoding methods, so it has vastly increased the way you wish to save your
music files. One drawback I noticed is that it can encode as WMA, but can't
decode them. You can also use an external program if you wish, but these are
sufficient for my needs.</p>

<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image010.jpg" alt="image010.jpg (25459 bytes)" width=521 height=341>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Again, this has been updated and Simple now allows for
customisable recording.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I won't go into details here as the author has everything
covered in his help guide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image012.jpg" alt="image012.jpg (30838 bytes)" width=521 height=341>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>This screen allows you to decide what happens behind the
scenes after and while you are converting music. The fact that Simple reads the
next track while it is encoding speeds up the process dramatically.most others
I have tried only do one thing at a time.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image014.jpg" alt="image014.jpg (18904 bytes)" width=521 height=341>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>There's even different language files available for Simple!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ripper has been expanded dramatically and is now a
valiant effort with all these changes. Encoding is still as Simple (no pun
intended) as before, but you now have more options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image016.jpg" alt="image016.jpg (32983 bytes)" width=456 height=438>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>How you name your files remains the same, but you have a
variety of servers to get the CDDB information. A new part is the load from
CDplayer.ini </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Now for the player.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The player has had a major update as well,it was pretty
basic before but now has loads more options. It is skinnable as are most others
and there are a variety of them in the downloads section of the website. To get
to the website, have a look at the beginning of the article!!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The player has an equaliser which is onscreen at the same
time as the player and is dockable with it.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image018.jpg" alt="image018.jpg (11147 bytes)" width=380 height=112>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>I use a fairly basic skin again ..pretty staid but pretty
IMHO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, get some of the others and decide what suits you, for
best effect. </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image020.jpg" alt="image020.jpg (13533 bytes)" width=514 height=142>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The controls are well laid out on this skin and all the
options readily available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Going into setup will bring up the following.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image022.jpg" alt="image022.jpg (19615 bytes)" width=414 height=304>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image024.jpg" alt="image024.jpg (41570 bytes)" width=553 height=355>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The playlist features are easy to follow, and have all the
usual options that most players do. You can also edit the ID tag from within
this menu, so it is a fairly powerful tool as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image026.jpg" alt="image026.jpg (22832 bytes)" width=414 height=304>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>On the plugins, dependant on the files you have downloaded,
you can also have DSP effects as well as visualisation ! Another major reorganisation
of the player.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="New_Simple_Files/image028.jpg" alt="image028.jpg (15040 bytes)" width=414 height=304>
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>And , as I said, skins are available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simple has had a lot of work put into it , and is well worth
a look, even for just the fact that it remains freeware. As time has went on
and version numbers increased, this program has steadily been improving. For
fast efficient ripping/encoding, it's a speed demon on my machine. The player
is now a formidable piece of work as well. Installing is as easy as a couple of
mouse clicks and it isn't going to take all that long to download either coming
in at under a meg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, downloading loads of skins from the site bumps
the time up, but well worth it just to give variety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Come on, give it a go ..its well worth the effort and adds
to the arsenal of tools for ripping/encoding/playing available. I can't
understand why this hasn't been highlighted over programs that require money
for people to use. There is no need to spend money when this level of writing
is available for the cost of a download!!</p>
