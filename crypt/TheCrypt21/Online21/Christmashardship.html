      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Do  you really expect me to go to Bethlehem?" Joseph banged  down
      his chisel on the scarred bench.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ephraim,   his  cousin,  had just entered the low workshop.   "You
      don't  have  a choice,  Joseph.  If you don't go the  Romans  will
      confiscate your house and your precious tools.  Just try to  carve
      a yoke with your fingernails."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "What  are we,  cowards?" the carpenter retorted.  "Mark my words,
      Ephraim,  this 'Enroll-in-your-ancestral-city' business is nothing
      more than a way to squeeze more taxes out of us.  If we give  into
      those foreign tyrants now they'll just be back for more money."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"What's  more," Joseph continued,  "you're crazy if you think  I'd
      take  Mary on a trip this month.  She'd probably have the baby  on
      the way!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Couldn't  you just leave her with your mother  for  a  couple  of
      weeks? She'd be all right.  Nobody says the women have to go. It's
      the heads of households who have to register."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Register, hah! Be taxed, you mean."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "So why not leave her at home?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joseph brushed the woodchips aside and motioned for his cousin  to
      sit down.  The carpenter spoke in a low but earnest voice. "Mary's
      aunt  has  made life miserable for her ever since  she  found  out
      Mary  was pregnant.  Some people were willing to let it  go.   Not
      Tabitha."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "She got my wife all stirred up about it," Ephraim volunteered.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Not  just your wife.  Most of the women in this town  go  out  of
      their way to avoid her.  At the village well they whisper, "Little
      slut!"  just  loud enough for her to hear.  Many's the  day  she's
      come running home in tears."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "People sure can be cruel," Ephraim said.  "At least you and  Mary
      went ahead and got married."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Joseph bit his lip, but didn't say more.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ephraim got up.  "Well,  you are going to Bethlehem,  aren't  you?
      You'd  be  a fool to get the Romans on your back.  You  know  what
      they did to old Ben."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Joseph stood up slowly.  "Yes,  I'll go.  But Mary'll have to come
      along. There's no way I'd leave her in Nazareth by herself!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> However,   when Joseph talked to Mary about it,  she  didn't  seem
      nearly  as sure as her husband.  "How could I walk all that  way?"
      she said. "I waddle now. I just can't make it."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Mary, we'll bring old Jake. You can ride him when you get tired."
      "Have you ever ridden on Jake?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well, no."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"That  animal  is the most bony,  jolting mule in  Nazareth.   I'd
      rather walk!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> She  did ride,  though ...  some of the way.  Joseph would finally
      stop for the day when Mary just couldn't take any more.  He'd help
      her  down  off Jake,  then he'd fix a fire while she would  unload
      their heavy blankets and try to find some shelter under a tree  or
      large rock.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  Mary  would always be the center of attention among the few  women
      traveling that time of year.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I remember when I was carrying Levi," one would start.  "Made  my
      feet swell. I couldn't do anything for months."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "That's nothing," replied another,  "my sister got so big everyone
      thought she was carrying twins.  But her time came there was  only
      one baby. Died though."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Joseph glanced over at Mary in the flickering firelight.  He could
      see  fear  flit across her face.  Her hands moved to  her  swollen
      belly so she could feel the baby's reassuring kick.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  The women didn't notice.  The first one went on,  "Oh,  the pain's
      so awful! I'm glad I'm too old to have any more babies."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Joseph  put his arm around Mary's shoulders and pulled her  close.
      Only one more night on the road before Bethlehem.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  reached the sleepy village of Joseph's ancestors just  about
      dusk  the  fifth  day.  Joseph went to the inn and  nearby  houses
      trying to find a place to sleep.  "God," he whispered as he combed
      the  town,  "can't You find us a decent place to have this  baby?"
      Nothing.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> All  at once he saw Mary's face tighten.  She tried to suppress  a
      groan  as  she fought with the pain.  It was a long moment  before
      she relaxed, but he could see worry written all over her.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joseph  went  back to the innkeeper again.  "Are  you  sure  there
      isn't any room? My wife's about to have a baby.  We've got to find
      a place out of this wind tonight!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The innkeeper thought a while.  "Did you try the house at the  end
      of the street? They sometimes take people in."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I tried an hour ago."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Any relatives in town? Any second cousins?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"No."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Mary was shivering now,  in obvious discomfort. "Joseph," she said
      weakly, "I've got to lie down somewhere."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Well,  there's the stable in the back," offered the innkeeper  at
      long last.  "Of course, it's full of animals from all the visitors
      in  town  for that blasted Roman census.  But if you  can  find  a
      place  in the corner,  I guess that'd be okay." He paused.   "Just
      don't keep the animals awake all night."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> It  was  the  other way around.  The dozen donkeys in the  strange
      barn never stopped moving.  And the smell was overpowering to Mary
      who had been fighting nausea as her pains got stronger.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> In  the wee hours of the morning Joseph knocked on the innkeeper's
      door again.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "What do you want this time of night?" the innkeeper snarled  when
      he finally came to the door.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Is there a midwife in town?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Oh,  it's you. A midwife? Yes, old Martha lives in a little house
      about  three blocks from here.  You go down the main  road,   turn
      left at the two-story house,  and go to the alley.  You can't miss
      it.  You go down the alley and across the pasture.  She lives in a
      shack just behind the third house after that."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I ...  I really don't think I should leave my wife. Her pains are
      coming awfully fast now.... Could you go?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Jonathan!" the innkeeper yelled into his darkened house.  "Get up
      and fetch old Martha. A lady's having a baby in the barn. Hurry!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">He turned to Joseph as he closed the door.  "Have some pity,  man.
      My whole family's awake now."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Pretty soon the door opened again and a young lad ran off  in  the
      chilly  air.   After a while he returned,  walking  slowly  so  he
      wouldn't  outdistance  the old midwife whose  arthritis  certainly
      didn't  to  take to cold winter nights.  The boy was shivering  by
      the time he got to the stable.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Here's Martha,  sir," he muttered quickly,  and darted back  into
      the warmth of his house.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  old  lady put them at ease right away.  She had Joseph  fetch
      water and cloths from the innkeeper.  It must have been nearly two
      in the morning by the time the baby came,  and another hour before
      Joseph dug into his robe for a few coins to give the old woman  as
      she hobbled away.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Then  he  returned to his wife and took her hand  as  they  looked
      into the puffy face of their son. Alone at last.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"I'm so tired, Joseph," Mary said, settling back into the blanket-
      covered straw.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The baby finally stopped crying and drifted off to sleep.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joseph  stirred a few minutes later as some men  peered  from  the
      darkness  into  the  lamp-lit stable.  He nudged  Mary  awake  and
      reached for his staff.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "What  do  you want?" Joseph said to the men in a forced  whisper.
      "Don't wake the baby."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"We're shepherds," one called out. The baby started crying.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"We  saw  angels out on the hills an hour ago." The  entire  story
      tumbled  out  as the shepherds edged into the stable  to  see  the
      baby. Joseph relaxed his grip on the staff.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  shepherd continued,  "And the angel told us,  'To you is born
      this  day  in  the  City of David a Savior which  is  Messiah  the
      Lord.' The angel even told us about the swaddling cloths  and  the
      manger here."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "The angel told you about the manger, too?" Joseph interrupted.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Oh, yes. That's how we knew where to look."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Joseph  glanced over at Mary.  Her eyes met his.  He squeezed  her
      hand.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "This baby is the Messiah,  isn't he?" Joseph said quietly. "After
      all  these hassles I had started to question.  But..." He  paused.
      "It's  almost like God planned the whole thing:  the trip  neither
      of  us  wanted to take." He chuckled.  "He must have seen  you  on
      bony  old  Jake." Joseph laughed out loud.  "Even this smelly  old
      barn and it's manger."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He stood up,  still chuckling.  "What do you know? In spite of the
      problems--no,  in the midst of the problems--God's  been  at  work
      all along."</P>
