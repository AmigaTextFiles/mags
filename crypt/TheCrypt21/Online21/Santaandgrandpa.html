 <font color=yellow>                    It's  Christmas time,and attention goes                     To the funny guy with his ho,ho, ho's                     Yes, we all know the Reindeer story                     And hear the tales of Santa's glory.
<P>
                     But this will pass, and soon over town                     The decorations will be coming down.                     They'll be put away until next year                     When it's time again for Christmas Cheer.
<P>
                     So I am sticking with another OLD GUY                     And I'm writing this to tell you why.                     Old Santa's great one day, it's true                     But Grandpa's here the whole year through.
<P>
                     He sits by me when I'm feeling bad,                      He's the best old friend I've ever had.                     He will tell me a story, yes, and then,                     He can quickly make me smile again.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=yellow>                     We fish and grandpa baits my hook,                     If I ask him he will read me a book.                     He holds my hand when we take a walk                     And he really listens when I talk.
<P>
                     So I truely love this dear OLD MAN,                     Who sees me every time he can.                     He goes with me and he cheers, too,                     When OLD Santa Claus is just passing through.<FONT COLOR=green>
