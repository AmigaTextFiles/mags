When  you  were  a  kid  did  you  geteverything you wanted off Santa Clauseor  were  you  the  same as me and gotstuff  for  school like socks, shirts,trousers,  new  shoes,  etc.  and if Iwas  very  lucky  a  Dandy  and  Beanoannual?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
It  always  appeared to me that if youwere rich you got more stuff off Santathan  if  you were poor.  It wasn't asif I didn't look after him every year.Without  fail I left a mince pie and aglass  of  sherry out for him.  When Igot  older I increased this to a platefull  of mince pies and a whole bottleof  the  best  sherry.  I even startedleaving  carrots  and  hay out for thefucking  reindeer,  but  I still nevergot what I asked for.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
Last year I got so pissed off with thefat  old  git  not  looking after me Idecided  to  try a different approach.I  heard  that the major computer shopin  Portsmouth  had built a Grotto forSanta and that he was sitting in thereasking  the  kids what they wanted himto  leave under the Christmas tree forthem.   I  decided  to pay him a visitmyself  and tell him face to face whatI wanted.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
When I got to the store the staff werea  bit  surprised for some reason as Ipaid  my fiver  at the grotto entranceand   tried  to  walk  in  by  myself."Excuse me sir" said a chap who lookedas if he'd come out of Burtons window."We  only  allow  adults in the Grottowith their children as a rule"."Does that mean I've got to go and getmy  Mum  or  Dad before I can go in" Isaid.   He  looked  at  me  in  a verystrange way and said "No, no you carryon  in  if you want to Sir I'm sure itwill be OK"<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
As   I   walked   forward   along  thepassageway  I  saw  little bloke aboutfour  foot  high  dressed all in greencollecting  the tickets off the peoplein  front  of me, they all appeared tobe  no older than about nine or ten infact I was the only grown up person inthere for some reason.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Hello  boys  and  girls  I'm Gary theGoblin,  Merry  Christmas  to you all"said the little bloke, "and welcome toSanta's Grotto"<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Hello    Gary   the   Goblin,   MerryChristmas  to  you  too"  The kids allshouted  in  reply, at this time I wasstanding  right  next to Gary.  So notto  be  left  out I shook his hand andsaid  "Pleased  to  meet you Mr Goblinaren't you a cute little fellow".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Gary  became  a  bit  upset  for  someunknown  reason  by  this  and shouted"That's  it,  that's  it take the pissout  of  me  you big eared bastard youwouldn't  say that if I was seven footfucking six tall would you"?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  was  quite  taken  aback  by Gary'ssudden  change in attitude, but beforeI  could  say  anything else the queuemoved  on.   As  I  looked  back I wasamazed to see the once friendly littlefellow  was  now  transformed  into  asnarling  evil  little  shit  who  wassnatching   the   tickets   from   thechildren  as  they approached and keptrepeating "I'm Gary the Gobbler, MerryFucking  Christmas".   The kids caughtup with the Christmas spirit of thingsand  all  chanted in reply "Hello Garythe   Gobbler,  and  a  Merry  FuckingChristmas to you too"!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  was a bit concerned by the childrenswearing   as   they   were,  but  I'daccepted   for   a   long   time  thatstandards had been slipping anyway.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
A few yard's farther on the passagewayopened  up  into  what  must have beenwhat  they called Santa's Grotto and Icaught  my  first glimpse of the greatman  himself sitting on a large chair.He  was wearing a bright red coat witha  hood  and  he had the longest whitebeard you ever saw.  He was surroundedby  box after box containing all sortsof    computer   hardware,   software,modems,   disk   drives,   games  harddrives, in fact you name it and it wasthere.   Standing on the other side ofSanta was a beautiful Fairy dressed ina skin tight silver costume with largesilk wings at the back.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  couldn't  help  but  notice  what agreat  figure  she had and if I hadn'tknown  she  was  one of Santa's littlehelpers  I'd have sworn she was one ofthe   local  girl's  who  did  toplessbarmaiding at the "El Gringo" wine barand  Disco  down  the High Street.  Onthis side of Santa was a wishing well,standing  next  to  this  was  anotherlittle  chap  about  the  same size asGary  but  this one was dressed all inblue  he  had  a badge on the front ofhis jacket which said "Eric the Elf".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
As the queue moved forward I could seethat  it  was  Eric's job to help eachvisitor  to climb on Santa's lap wherethey  were  then  asked  by Santa whatthey   wanted  for  Christmas,  havingwhispered  their  reply  to  him  theyclimbed down, went up to the Fairy whorummaged  round  in  a  big  sack fromwhich  she  then produced a parcel forthem,  after  that  they were directedtowards a door marked exit.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
It  was  all rather rushed and over inthe  blink of an eye so it wasn't longbefore  I  stood  in front of Eric theElf "Which kids yours" he said.
<P>
"None  of them, it's me that's come tosee Santa."
<P>
"Your  having me on" said Eric "it's aYour've Been Framed stunt ain't it."
<P>
"No,"  I  said  "I want to see Santa".Eric  broke out into laughter for somereason  but  I  ignored him and turnedtowards  Santa  "I'm not having you onmy  bloody lap you must be at least 14stone, you'll crush me nuts" he said.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
To  my  surprise he too broke out intouncontrollable  laughter.  Now by thistime  I'd  gathered that both Eric theElf  and Santa were laughing at me forsome  reason  and  I  decided to leavebefore  I lost my temper with them.  Iwalked  over  to  the Fairy who by nowwas  also  laughing.  She looked up atme  and  said "Aren't you a little oldfor this sort of thing or are you somesort of pervert or what".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
That  was  the  final straw I'm afraidand  I lost my temper and said.  "I'vepaid  my  fiver like everybody else sogimme  a  parcel  before  I  rip  yourfucking wings off".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
She  stopped  laughing and practicallydived  into the sack to get my parcel,but as she did so her tits dropped outof   the   top   of  her  costume.   Iimmediately    recognised   a   flowertattooed  on  her left breast and knewstraight away who she really was.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Your  not a real Fairy," I said "yourthat  tart from the wine bar they call"Martini", cause  it's  any  time, anyplace, anywhere, for you ain't it?"
<P>
At  this  point  all hell broke loose.Santa threw a kid off his lap onto thefloor  and shouted at me "You shitheadthat's my Misses your talking to".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The very irate Santa then rushed at melike  something  possessed,  but as hedid  so  he  knocked Eric the Elf overand  the  little  chap ended up upsidedown in the Wishing Well with his feetin the air.  Santa in the meantime hadgrabbed me by the throat and had begunto  shake my head from side to side, Idecided  enough  was  enough and kneedhim  in the bollocks with every bit ofstrength I could find.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
He  fell  to  the floor like a big redsack  of  potatoes.   As  he  fell hisbeard came off together with his hood.I   looked   down   at  him  in  totaldisbelief!   This  wasn't  Santa, thiswas   Ted  who  worked  part  time  atTesco's  as a shelf loader.  Where wasthe  real  Father  Christmas  what hadthese bastards done to him?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Where's Santa" I shouted at Ted.  Tedmade no reply he just lay there on thefloor  holding his groin and screamingin such agony it could have been heardback at the North Pole.  The woman whohad  a  few  minutes  before  been  anangelic Fairy came at me and hit me onthe  head  with the largest parcel shecould find in her sack.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  fell  on  top of Ted who grabbed meand we began banging and crashing intothe  grotto walls and scenery, all thenicely  boxed computer stuff fell overthen  during our following struggle wemanaged   to   break   or   completelydemolish  six  plastic  Reindeer,  twofairy lights, a half dozen toadstool'sthree papier-mache Snowmen, a Nativityscene made from toilet rolls Cornflakeboxes  and  empty  plastic bottles (asmade  on  Blue Peter the week before).Then  just  as  a  final touch we fellcompletely  through  a  cardboard roofand  took  with us a chimney pot and asleigh  made  out  of  egg  boxes  andstring.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   
<P>
As  you  can  imagine  by the time thedust   settled   besides   seventy-twoscreaming  kids,  a  tattooed Fairy, avery grumpy Goblin and an enraged Elf.Ted  and I had been joined in what wasleft  of  Santa's  Grotto by the storemanager,  four  sales  personnel and aman  from  the  RSPCA  who kept asking"Has  there  been  any  cruelty to theReindeer".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  sat  amongst  the  debris for a fewminutes wandering why on earth any onewould  want to kidnap Santa Clause andthen  take  his  place.  At this pointthe  store manager came up to me "Whatthe bloody hell's going on, what's thebig problem."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"This  is a phoney Santa" I said "Callthe  Police,  they've got the real onehid  away  somewhere,  I bet they weregoing to demand ransom money for him"
<P>
The  manager  then whispered in my ear"Are you an idiot or what of course itain't  the  real Santa there's no suchthing  as  Santa Clause.  Santa Clauseain't for real don't you know that"?
<P>
I  was  stunned "Your having me on," Isaid "Everyone know's he's real".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  manger  and  his staff then spentthe  next twenty minutes shattering mydreams and illusions.  They eventuallymanaged  to  convince  me that in factSanta  Clause after all did not reallyexist and that my Mom and Dad had beentelling  me  lies all these year's.  Iwas  devastated  by this news as I betyou are now but somebody had to put anend  to  all  the  lies and the deceitthat's  gone  on for all these year's,somebody  had to tell the truth.  So Isaid  to the Manager "I'm going to thepress  and I'm going to tell the worldwhat you've just told me".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"You  can't  do  that,"  he  said "Thewhole  of  the  business world rely onChristmas  sales to exist if you go tothe press we'll all be ruined."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I don't care," I said "the truth mustcome out."
<P>
The manager went a funny purple colourand said "Don't do a thing, wait theretill I get back".He walked away and I surveyed what wasleft   of  the  Grotto.   A  very  sadlooking  Santa  was being supported byan  even  sadder  looking  fairy  withbroken  wings,  Eric the Elf was beinghelped  out  of  the  well by Gary theGoblin  and the Grotto itself had beentotally  flattened, they all looked atme  in  disgust  and  began  mutteringobscenities  at  me still it wasn't myfault  was it they shouldn't have toldme Porky Pies should they?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The Manager returned at this point andsaid  to me "Look, I've spoken to headoffice and they've decided that if yousay  nothing about this to anybody youcan  have whatever you want off us forChristmas".
<P>
What  a kind man I thought, there is aFather  Christmas after all.  I know Iwas  bribed  but  what  would you havedone?    Anyway   they   let  me  takeeverything I wanted and I had the bestChristmas   ever  and  I  finished  upowning,   a  Pentium  3  PC,  printer,scanner,  web cam, monitor, etc.  etc.it was wonderful.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>Still  that was<FONT COLOR=red> LAST<FONT COLOR=cyan> year and I'd likeone   or  two  things off  Santa  thisChristmas, so if you know where he hashis  Grotto  this  year give me a callI've got a brand new list for him.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
        I WOULD LIKE TO WISH A      GREAT CHRISTMAS TO ANYONE!<FONT COLOR=red>
