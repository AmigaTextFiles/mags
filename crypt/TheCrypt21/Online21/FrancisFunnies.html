                           HOW TO SHOWER LIKE A WOMAN<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Take  off  all  clothing  and place it in a sectioned laundry hamper,      according to lights, darks, whites, man-made or natural.      Walk to the bathroom wearing long dressing gown.      If husband is seen along the way, cover up any exposed flesh and rush      to the bathroom.      Look at womanly physique in mirror and stick out belly.      Complain and whine about getting fat.      Get in shower.      Look  for face cloth, arm cloth, loin cloth, long loofah, wide loofah      and pumice stone.      Wash  hair  once  with cucumber and lamphrey shampoo, wash hair again      with  cucumber and lamphrey shampoo with 83 added vitamins, after all      you're worth it!      Condition  hair  with  cucumber  and lamphrey conditioner and enhance      natural crocus oil, leave on hair for 15 minutes.      Wash  face with crushed apricot facial scrub for 10 minutes until red      raw.      Wash rest of body entirely in ginger and jaffa cake body wash.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Rinse  off  conditioner  taking at least 15 minutes to make sure that      it's all come off.      Shave armpits and legs.      Consider shaving bikini line, but decide to get it waxed instead.      Scream  loudly  when husband flushes toilet causing the loss of water      pressure and turning it red hot.      Squeegee all wet surfaces in shower.      Spray mould spots with suitable mould remover or Tilex.      Get  out  of  shower and dry with a towel the size of a small African      country.      Wrap hair in super absorbent second towel.      Check entire body for remotest signs of spots.      Attack with nails or tweezers (if you can find them).      Return to bedroom wearing long dressing gown and towel on head.      If  husband seen, cover up any exposed areas and then rush to bedroom      to spend an hour and a half getting ready.

<P>
      Take  off clothes while sitting on bed and leave them on the floor in      a pile.      Walk  naked  to  the  bathroom.   If wife seen, shake knob at her and      shout "way hey!"      Look in mirror and suck in gut and admire your manly physique.      Admire size of knob in mirror.      Scratch bollocks and smell finger for one last whiff.      Get in shower.      Don't bother to look for wash cloth because you don't need one.      Wash face and armpits.      Laugh at how loud your farts sound in the shower.      Wash bollocks and surrounding area.      Wash arse remembering to leave some fetching hair on the soap.      Shampoo hair but don't condition.      Make mohican hairstyle with shampoo.      Pull back the curtain to see self in mirror.      Piss in shower.      Rinse off and get out of shower.      Fail  to  notice  water  on floor because curtain has been outside of      shower for the whole time.      Partially dry off.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Look at self in mirror, flex muscles and admire size of knob again.      Leave shower curtain open and wet bath mat on floor.      Leave bathroom light and fan on.      Return to bedroom with towel around waist.      If  you  pass  wife,  pull  off  towel, grab knob and go "yeah baby!"      whilst thrusting pelvis towards her.      Throw wet towel on floor.      Put on yesterday's clothes.

<FONT COLOR=green>                     AN ENGLISHMAN, IRISHMAN AND A SCOTSMAN<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  Scotsman  was  sitting with an Irishman and an Englishman in Saudi      Arabia.   They  were sharing a smuggled barrel of beer, when all of a      sudden,  Saudi police entered and arrested them.  They were initially      sentenced   to  death  but  they  contested  this  and  were  finally      imprisoned for life.
<P>
      But,  as  it was a national holiday, the Sheik decided they should be      released  after  receiving  20  lashes  of  the  whip.   As they were      preparing  for  their  punishment, the Sheik suddenly said:  "It's my      first  wife's  birthday  today, and she asked me to allow each of you      one wish before your whipping."
<P>
      So  the  Irish  guy thought for a while and then said:  "Please tie a      pillow  to  my  back."  This  was  done but the pillow only lasted 10      lashes before the whip went through.
<P>
      The Englishman, watching the scene, said:  "Please fix two pillows on      my  back".  But even two pillows could only take 10 lashes before the      whip went through again.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Before  The Scotsman could say something, the Sheik turned to him and      said:   "As you are from a great country, and your football teams and      your  rock  bands  are terrific, and your women gorgeous you can have      two wishes!".
<P>
      "Thank  you, Most Royal and Merciful Highness", The Scotsman replies.      "My  first  wish  is:   " I would like to have 40 lashes." "If you so      desire",  the Sheik replies with a questioning look on his face, "and      your  second  wish?"  "Tie  the  Englishman to my back", the Scotsman      answers.
