         Well dear readers, What exactly does Christmas mean for you?
<P>
               Perhaps DEBT ... WORRY ... CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS
<P>
      A  great  many of us,  Now Dread Christmas,  Dread the  fact  that      Children  Want Brand Name Clothes,  The latest Computers  or  Game      consoles and we Strive our best to give them what they want.
<P>
      Sure  there is nothing better,  Than on Christmas Morning watching      as  you  Children open the Gifts that they WANTED,  But  there  is      another side to Christmas.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
                    <CENTER>You see CHRISTMAS Isn't Just For Kids.</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Christmas is a time of Joy, Peace and Happiness to all People.
<P>
      Is  you  Duty over ...  Just because you sent your Grandparents  a      Card? ...  What about old Aunt Annie ... Yes you might have sent a      greetings card ... Is that the end of the Christmas Spirit.
<P>
      Of  course its not just your own Relatives ...  What about the Old      Man or Woman living in the Next Street.  The Man or Woman who have      just become Divorced or lost a Loved one.
<P>
      Christmas  CAN  be  a  time  of  great  happiness  and  Joy,   But      alternatively  it can be a time of great loneliness  and  sadness,      Can  there  be anything worse than Spending Christmas by yourself,      Knowing that no one else in the World Cares.
<P>
      Mostly  this affects the Older Generations,  The ones to  "Set  in      there ways" ...To "Infirm" or disabled to make proper contact with      the Outside world.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
                     Spare them a Thought this Christmas<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      People don't Grow OLD, It's their Bodies that grow old. The people      living in those bodies are the same as they always have been, with      the same feelings.
<P>
      Have younger people ever thought how it feels to have a body  that      no  longer serves the person it belongs to,  That feels heavy  and      awkward and hurts?
<P>
      Older people still want to do the things they always did,  But  in      many cases its just not possible.
<P>
      Is  it too much to ask,  that at this time of year,  We Smile  and      wish  them a "Merry Christmas" ...  No need for expensive Presents      or gifts ... Just a friendly Greeting can make someone very happy.      Try it! It might just make your Christmas worthwhile.<FONT COLOR=red>
