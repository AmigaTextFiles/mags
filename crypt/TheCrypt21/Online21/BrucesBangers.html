      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  film  had been on for half an hour when a woman came running out
      to the foyer looking very upset.  "I've been interfered with !!!" she
      complained to the manager.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  eventually  managed to calm her down and move her to another part
      of  the  cinema when another woman came running out claiming the same
      thing!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This  was  too much for the manager so he grabbed a torch and went to
      investigate.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  looked  around  for  a  bit and then saw an old bald man crawling
      around on all fours.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "What's going on?" he demanded</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "I've  lost  my  hairpiece"  said the man, "and the annoying thing is
      I've had my hands on it twice but it got away?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  guy  goes  to  a doctor and explains that every time he sneezes he

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two  drunks  come  staggering out of a zoo, clothes in tatters, their
      hands  and faces covered in blood.  One of them says..  "I don't rate
      that lion dancing much!"</P>

                                 <CENTER> ************</CENTER>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Paddy  and  Mick  at  an  airport  VIP lounge and they reckon the guy
      accross the way is the Pope.</P>
    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  Mick says to Paddy, "Only one way to know .. go and ask him"</P>
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy  goes  up  to this bloke and asks...  "Excuse me..  Are you the
      Pope ?"</P>
     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Fuck off!" came the reply.</P>
      <P ALIGN="LEFT">So he goes back to Mick and says .. "He won't say"</P>

                                <CENTER> NOAH'S NEW ARK</CENTER><P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> It is the year 2000, and Noah lives in the United States.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Lord  speaks to Noah and says:  "In one year, I am going to make
      it  rain and cover the whole earth with water until all is destroyed.
      But  I want you to save the righteous people and two of every kind of
      living  thing  on the earth.  Therefore, I am commanding you to build
      an Ark."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In a flash of lightning, God delivered the specifications for an Ark.
      Fearful  and  trembling,  Noah took the plans and agreed to build the
      Ark.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Remember,"  said  the  Lord,  "you  must  complete the Ark and bring
      everything aboard in one year."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Exactly  one  year  later, a fierce storm cloud covered the earth and
      all the seas of the earth went into a tumult.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  The Lord saw Noah sitting in his front yard weeping.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  "Noah." He shouted, "Where is the Ark?"</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  "Lord,  please  forgive  me!"  cried Noah.  "I did my best, but there
      were big problems.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> First, I had to get a permit for construction, and your plans did not
      comply  with the codes.  I had to hire an engineering firm and redraw
      the plans.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then  I got into a fight with OSHA over whether or not the Ark needed
      a  fire  sprinkler  system  and floatation devices.  Then my neighbor
      objected,  claiming I was violating zoning ordinances by building the
      Ark  in  my  front  yard  so  I  had  to get a variance from the city
      planning commission.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  I  had  problems  getting enough wood for the Ark because there was a
      ban on cutting trees to protect the Spotted Owl.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  finally  convinced the U.S.  Forest Service that I needed the wood
      to  save  the owls.  However, the Fish and Wildlife Service won't let
      me catch any owls.  So, no owls.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  carpenters  formed  a  union  and  went out on strike.  I had to
      negotiate  a settlement with the National Labor Union.  Now I have 16
      carpenters on the Ark, but still no owls.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When I started rounding up the other animals, I got sued by an animal
      rights  group.   They  objected  to  me  only taking two of each kind
      aboard.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Just  when I got the suit dismissed, the EPA notified me that I could
      not complete the Ark without filing an environmental impact statement
      on your proposed flood.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They   didn't  take  very  kindly  to  the  idea  that  they  had  no
      jurisdiction  over  the conduct of the Creator of the universe.  Then
      the  Army  Corps of Engineer demanded a map of the proposed new flood
      plain.   I  sent  them  a globe.  Right now, I am trying to resolve a
      complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that
      I  am  practicing  discrimination  by not taking godless, unbelieving
      people aboard!</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  IRS has seized all my assets, claiming that I'm building the Ark
      in preparation to flee the country to avoid paying taxes.  I just got
      a  notice  from the state that I owe some kind of user tax and failed
      to register the Ark as a recreational water raft.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Finally,  the  ACLU  got  the  courts  to issue an injunction against
      further  construction  of  the Ark, saying that since God is flooding
      the earth, it is a religious event and therefore unconstitutional.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  really don't think I can finish the Ark for another 5 or 6 years!"
      Noah wailed.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  sky began to clear, the sun began to shine and the seas began to
      calm.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> A rainbow arched across the sky.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT">  Noah looked up hopefully.  "You mean you are not going to destroy the
      earth, Lord?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "No," said the Lord sadly.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "The government already has."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> AMEN</P>
