<FONT COLOR=white><CENTER><H1>D.O.O.N - The Ultimate Amiga Utilities CD</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      If  you  have Opus installed on your Amiga, then you really need this      CD.   As  it  has  everything you could possibly want to enhance your      machine.
<P>
      First  of  all,  for  those of you who don't have or have never tried      Opus,  then  there  is version 4.12 of this wonderful program on this      CD.   But  if  like  me and you couldn't run your Amiga without Opus5      then  this  has  everything  you  could  need, and several things you      didn't know about on it.
<P>
      You know what it's like, where you have to scour all your Aminet CD's      or  go  online and try to find that one utility you need, and usually      it  takes  you  the  best  part of an hour to find it.  Well worry no      more!   For this CD has everything you need.  For instance:  hundreds      of  background  pictures,  and over a hundred themes.  Jayne Johnston      has  put  together  an  easy to follow tutorial and all the tools are      included  on the CD so you can create your own themes.  And there are      all  the  filetypes  you could possibly want.  And if your a beginner      with  Opus,  or  you  just  want  to make more of Opus then there are      tutorials  from our very own Steve Hyde and Ray Hawkins.  If you load      up  a web browser and go into Tutorials/Index.html this will take you      through Opus from a beginners tutorial to a more advanced stage.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      The Class Act draw contains not only the program but most importantly      a  key  file  which  will  turn  Class  Act into a registered version      (Thanks to Salim Gasmi the Author)

      All the boing bags are here in one place and enough datatypes to keep      your  Amiga  up to date.  Also the Magellan patches to take you up to      5.82.   I  even  found a load of new buttons for the listers so I can      get  rid  of those old grey scale ones I use at the moment.  And even      if  you  don't  use Opus there is plenty on here for you as well.  Do      you use OS3.9?  With the icon bar at the bottom?  And do you wish the      icons  were  smaller?   Again there is a solution for you on this CD,      with  tiny  icons  in  the  DOpus/OpusGIbar3/images  drawer which are      perfect  to make the bar as small as possible giving you more room on      the  screen.   And  talking of icon's, there are so many on this CD I      don't know how they crammed it all in, with icons for Newicons OS 3.5      and  OS  3.9  and enough utilities to fill a CD all on it's own, with      things like Powersnap, Snoopdos, FBlit and I even found PPaint 6.6 in      the tools drawer.<

      So  would  I  recommend that you go out and buy it?  You bet I would!      This  CD  has  more  on it than I thought possible, and everything is      together  in  one  place.   Whether  you  run  Opus or Workbench, use      listers or icons, this CD has all you need.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      And  No!  You can't have my copy, go out and buy your own!  As I have      a  lot to do now, making my Amiga look and perform better than it has      for a long while.<FONT COLOR=red>
