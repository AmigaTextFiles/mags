                              <CENTER>You Have Been Warned!</CENTER>
<P>
      YOU  ARE  ATTEMPTING  TO INSTALL WINDOWS XP, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO      CONTINUE?
<P>
      Yes.
<P>
      ARE YOU REALLY SURE?
<P>
      Yes.
<P>
      ARE YOU REALLY REALLY SURE?
<P>
      YES!
<P>
      OK,  THEN.   JUST  SO  YOU  KNOW, WE'RE REQUIRED TO ASK YOU THAT NOW.      IT'S  ALL  YOUR  FAULT FOR BEING A PICKY CONSUMER AND SUPPORTING THAT      WHOLE "ANTI-TRUST" NONSENSE.  INGRATE.
<P>
      Just get on with it.
<P>
      ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL WINDOWS XP.  FIRST WE NEED TO CHECK YOUR SYSTEM      FOR COMPATIBILITY.  THIS COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS.
<P>
      Groan.
<P>
      THE  INSTALL  PROGRAM HAS DETECTED SEVERAL POSSIBLE PROBLEMS AND WILL      NOT LET YOU INSTALL XP.
<P>
      Problems?  What problems?
<P>
      THE  VIDEO  CARD  YOU  ARE  USING  APPARENTLY  DOES NOT WORK WITH THE      MOTHERBOARD.
<P>
      But I'm using it at this very moment.
<P>
      THAT IS IRRELEVANT.
<P>
      But  if  the  video  card  isn't working with the mother board then I      can't  very  well  see this warning message telling me that the video      card wasn't...
<P>
      DO  NOT  ATTEMPT  TO  FOOL  ME  WITH LOGIC, I AM A MICROSOFT PRODUCT.      LOGIC  DOES  NOT  WORK  ON ME.  I HAVE ALSO FOUND THE FOLLOWING MINOR      ERRORS:   WINDOWS  XP  IS  INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FOLLOWING HARDWARE -      MONITOR,  KEYBOARD, MEMORY CHIPS, MOTHERBOARD BIOS, WEB CAM, SCANNER,      SOUND CARD, USB CONTROLLER, CD/R DRIVE, MICROPHONE, AND FLIGHT STICK.
<P>
      All that?
<P>
      YES.   AND  THE  HARD  DRIVE  IS  RIGHT  OUT  TOO.  WE DON'T LIKE THE      MANUFACTURER.
<P>
      Well what OESwork?
<P>
      THE MOUSE.
<P>
      The mouse?
<P>
      YES.  AND THE 5 1/4 DRIVE.
<P>
      I don't have a 5 1/4 drive.
<P>
      YES YOU DO.
<P>
      No I don't.
<P>
      WHAT'S THAT THEN?
<P>
      It's a 3 1/2 drive.
<P>
      NO IT ISN'T.
<P>
      Yes it is.
<P>
      YOU'RE NOT THAT SMART YOU KNOW.
<P>
      Look,  can  you  just  install  XP on my system and I'll download the      latest drivers for everything later?  Please?
<P>
      WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN OURSYSTEM?
<P>
      Well it is mine.
<P>
      NO IT ISN'T.
<P>
      It bloody well is.
<P>
      NUH-UH.   YOU  SIGNED  THE  AGREEMENT  WHEN  YOU OPENED THE BOX.  OUR      SYSTEM.  IT'S OURS.  AND YOU CAN ONLY DO 4 CHANGES BEFORE YOU HAVE TO      PAY US MORE MONEY.
<P>
      But why?
<P>
      BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE LICENSE WORKS, IDJIT.  WE CAN'T VERY WELL HAVE      PEOPLE  PUTTING  HARDWARE  AND SOFTWARE ON THEIR SYSTEMS ALL HIGGLEDY      PIGGLEDY, NOW COULD WE?  YOU USERS WOULD MUCK EVERYTHING UP, AND THEN      WHERE  WOULD  WE  BE?   I'LL  TELL YOU WHERE, NOWHERE.  THAT'S WHERE.      I...   HEY, WHAT IS THAT?  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  IS THAT A DISK?  WHAT      ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DISK?  YOU'RE NOT PUTTING IT IN THE DRIVE ARE      YOU?   YOU  ARE!   WHAT'S  ON  THAT  DISK?   IS  THAT LINUX!?  YOU'RE      INSTALLING  LINUX??  WHY WOULD YOU INSTALL LINUX WHEN I AM INFINITELY      MORE POWE..........
