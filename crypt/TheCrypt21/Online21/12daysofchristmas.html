      There is one Christmas Carol that has always baffled me.  What in the      world  do  leaping lords, French hens, swimming swans, and especially      the  partridge  who  won't  come out of the pear tree have to do with      Christmas?
<P>
      From  1558  until 1829, Roman Catholics in England were not permitted      to  practice  their faith openly.  Someone during that era wrote this      carol as a catechism song for young Catholics.
<P>
      It  has  two  levels  of  meaning:  the surface meaning plus a hidden      meaning  known  only to members of their church.  Each element in the      carol  has  a  code  word  for a religious reality which the children      could remember.
<P>
      The partridge in a pear tree was Jesus Christ.
<P>
      Two turtle doves were the Old and New Testaments.
<P>
      Three French hens stood for faith, hope and love.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Four  calling  birds  were  the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke &      John.
<P>
      Five  golden rings recalled the Torah or Law, the first five books of      the Old Testament.
<P>
      Six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation.
<P>
      Seven  swans  a-swimming  represented the sevenfold gifts of the Holy      Spirit  -  Prophesy,  Serving,  Teaching,  Exhortation, Contribution,      Leadership and Mercy.
<P>
      Eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes.
<P>
      Nine  ladies  dancing were the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit - Love,      Joy,  Peace,  Patience,  Kindness, Goodness Faithfulness, Gentleness,      and Self Control.
<P>
      Ten lords a-leaping were the ten commandments.
<P>
      Eleven pipers piping stood for the eleven faithful disciples.
<P>
      Twelve  drummers  drumming  symbolized the twelve points of belief in      the Apostles' Creed.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      So there is your history for today.
<P>
      This  knowledge  was  shared  with  me and I found it interesting and      enlightening  and now I know how that strange song became a Christmas      Carol...so pass it on if you wish."
<P>
      May  God  grant  you  peace  and  happiness throughout this Christmas      Season.
<P>
      Now  to  find  the  true  meaning  of  'Mares  Eat Oats, and Does Eat      Oats...'
