<P>
                         <CENTER> Snowflakes softly falling</CENTER>  
                       <CENTER>Upon your window they play.</CENTER>  
                      <CENTER>Your blankets snug around you, </CENTER>
                       <CENTER> Into sleep you drift away.  </CENTER> <P> 

                      <CENTER>I bend to gently kiss you,</CENTER>   
                      <CENTER>when I see that on the floor </CENTER>  
                    <CENTER>there's a letter, neatly written    </CENTER>
                       <CENTER> I wonder who it's for.</CENTER>
<P>
                            <CENTER> I quietly unfold it </CENTER>  
                    <CENTER>making sure you're still asleep, </CENTER>
                      <CENTER>It's a Christmas list for Santa </CENTER>
                       <CENTER>one my heart will always keep.</CENTER>
<P>
                         <CENTER> It started just as always  </CENTER>
                       <CENTER> with the toys seen on TV,  </CENTER>  
                     <CENTER>A new watch for your father  </CENTER> 
                       <CENTER>and a winter coat for me. </CENTER> <P>
    
                      <CENTER>But as my eyes read on    </CENTER>       
             <CENTER> I could see that deep inside  </CENTER>    
      <CENTER>there were many things you wished for</CENTER>
 <CENTER>that your loving     heart would hide.</CENTER><FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
                        <CENTER>You asked if your friend Molly  </CENTER>
                        <CENTER> could have another Dad; </CENTER>       
                <CENTER> It seems her father hits her  </CENTER>        
               <CENTER> and it makes you very sad. </CENTER> <P>   
        
             <CENTER>Then you asked dear Santa  </CENTER>        
             <CENTER>if the neighbors down the street    </CENTER>
                   <CENTER>Could find a job, that he might have some food,</CENTER>
 <CENTER>and clothes,  and heat.</CENTER>
<P>
                        <CENTER> You saw a family on the news  </CENTER>
                      <CENTER> whose house had blown away,</CENTER>  
   <CENTER> "Dear  Santa,  send them just one thing,</CENTER>
<CENTER> a place where  they  can      stay."</CENTER><P>

<CENTER>"And Santa, those four cookies</CENTER>
<CENTER> that I left you for a treat, </CENTER>
    <CENTER> Could  you  take  them to the children</CENTER>
 <CENTER>who have  nothing  else  to      eat." </CENTER><P>

<CENTER> "Do  you know that little bear I have</CENTER>
<CENTER> the  one  I  love  so         dear?" </CENTER>
<CENTER>"I'm leaving it for you to take</CENTER>
<CENTER> to Africa this year."</CENTER><FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
                       <CENTER> "And as you fly your reindeer   </CENTER> 
                   <CENTER> on this night of Jesus' birth,  </CENTER>
<CENTER>Could  your magic bring to everyone</CENTER>
 <CENTER>goodwill and peace on  earth." </CENTER> <P>
 
  <CENTER> "There's one last thing before you go</CENTER>
<CENTER>so grateful I would be,</CENTER>
<CENTER> If            you'd smile at Baby Jesus</CENTER>
<CENTER> in the manger by our tree."</CENTER>

<P>
                      <CENTER> I pulled the letter close to me </CENTER>       
                   <CENTER>I felt it melt my heart.    </CENTER>             
       <CENTER> Those tiny hands had written   </CENTER>        
             <CENTER> what no other could impart.   </CENTER> <P> 

    <CENTER>" A little child shall lead them," </CENTER>
<CENTER>was whispered in my ear,  </CENTER>      
           <CENTER>As I watched you sleep on Christmas Eve,</CENTER>   
                      <CENTER>while Santa Clause was here.</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>                            <CENTER>Have a happy Christmas</CENTER><FONT COLOR=green>
