<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The following story was not really intended for publication, it is in      fact an EMAIL!  Let me explain.
<P>
      Way  back  on  Halloween  Sunday,  Ferret  and I were bored, the last      edition  of The Crypt magazine had just been released and the mailing      list  was  very  quite.   Ferret decided to post the start of a silly      story  to The Crypt mailing list and I responded by adding a bit more      to  it.   The  story went back and forth with each of us adding to it      until it was complete.
<P>
      Just a bit of fun was all it was mean't to be,but others on The Crypt      list had different ideas.  "Put it in The Crypt, put it in The Crypt"      was  response that we received.  So apart from some grammar and spell      checking....You can now ALL read what daft things your Editors get up      to on their day off!
