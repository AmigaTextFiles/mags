<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Merry <FONT COLOR=red> Cryptmas<FONT COLOR=cyan>  everyone and welcome to this page of festive humour.      We  were  all  thinking  a  while back of what Special items we could      include on this page when Zola our Webmaster came up with this idea.
<P>
      Well  as  you  all  know  it's <FONT COLOR=red> The  Crypt's<FONT COLOR=cyan> tradition to poke fun at      something  or  someone  each  edition and so keeping with it we can't      think of a better person than good old Santa Claus.
<P>
      Santa,  that  jolly,  fat  gutted old fart that pays us a visit every      Christmas,  bringing  toys  for  the  children and yet more socks and      handkerchiefs  for  the  adults.   Yes  Santa, it's YOUR turn to be a      victim of<FONT COLOR=red> The Crypt.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Readers,  enjoy  the  humorous cartoons we have prepared for you, but      above all have a very lovely <FONT COLOR=red>Cryptmas.
