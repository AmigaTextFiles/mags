<P>
      Brenda  O'Malley  is  home  making dinner as usual, when Tim Finnegan      arrives at her door.
<P>
      "Brenda, may I come in?" he asks.  "I've somethin' to tell ya."
<P>
      "Of course you can come in.  You're always welcome, Tim.  But where's      my husband?"
<P>
      "That's  what  I'm  here  to  be  tellin'  ya,  Brenda.  There was an      accident down at the Guinness brewery."
<P>
      "Oh, God no!" cries Brenda.  "Please don't tell me..."
<P>
      "I must, Brenda.  Your husband Shamus is dead and gone.  I'm sorry."
<P>
      Finally, she looked up at Tim.  "How did it happen, Tim?"
<P>
      "It  was  terrible, Brenda.  He fell into a vat of Guinness Stout and      drowned."
<P>
      Oh  my  dear Jesus!  But you must tell me true, Tim.  Did he at least      go quickly?"
<P>
      "Well, no Brenda, no."
<P>
      "No?"
<P>
      "Fact is, he got out three times to pee."

                                  <CENTER>RULES FOR MEN</CENTER>
<P>
      1.   Any  man  who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally      killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.
<P>
      2.  Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.
<P>
      3. It is OK for a man to cry under the following circumstances:      a. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse.      b. After wrecking his boss' Ferrari.      c. When his date is using her teeth.
<P>
      4.  Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend      out of jail within 12 hours.
<P>
      5.   If  you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off      limits forever, unless you actually marry her.
<P>
      6.   The  minimum  amount  of  time  you have to wait for a guy who's      running late is five minutes.  Maximum waiting time is six minutes
<P>
      7.   Complaining  about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is      forbidden.  Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.
<P>
      8.   No  man  shall  ever  be  required to buy a birthday present for      another  man.   (In  fact,  even remembering your buddy's birthday is      strictly optional.)
<P>
      9.  When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may      always  ask  the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask      who's playing.
<P>
      10  You may flatulate in front of a woman only after you have brought      her to climax.  If you trap her head under the covers for the purpose      of flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.
<P>
      11.  It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're      sunning  on  a  tropical  beach  ...  and it's delivered by a topless      supermodel ...  and it's free.
<P>
      12.  Friends don't let friends wear Speedos.  Ever.  Issue closed.
<P>
      13.   If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem -- you didn't see      nothin'.
<P>
      14.   Women  who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as      spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to      pick a buffalo wing clean.
<P>
      15.   You  must offer heartfelt and public condolences over the death      of a girlfriend's cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire      and threw it into a ceiling fan.
<P>
      16.  If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking      about his choice of beer.
<P>
      17.   Phrases  that  may  not be uttered to another man while lifting      weights:      a. Yeah, Baby, Push it!      b. C'mon, give me one more! Harder!      c. Another set and we can hit the showers!      d. Nice butt. Are you a Sagittarius? 
<P>
      18.   Never  talk  to  a  man  in  a bathroom unless you are on equal      footing:   both  urinating, both waiting in line, etc.  For all other      situations,  an  almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you      need.
<P>
      19.  Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you      are  able  to have sex with her.  Keep a stopwatch by the phone; hang      up if necessary.
<P>
      20.   When a buddy is trying to hook up, you may sabotage him only in      a manner that gives you no chance of hooking up either.
<P>

                                  <CENTER>Science Final</CENTER>
<P>
      A  not  necessarily  well-prepared  student  sat  in his Life Science      classroom,  staring  at  a  question  on  the  final exam paper.  The      question directed:
<P>
          "Give four advantages of breast milk."
<P>
      What  to  write?  He sighed, and began to scribble whatever came into      his head, hoping for the best:
<P>
         <P ALIGN="LEFT"> 1. No need to boil.  </P>

       <P ALIGN="LEFT"> 2. Never goes sour. </P>   

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">3. Available whenever necessary.</P>
<P>
      So  far  so  good  -  maybe.   But the exam demanded a fourth answer.      Again,  what  to  write?   Once  more,  he  sighed.   He frowned.  He      scowled, then sighed again.
<P>
      Suddenly,  he  brightened.   He grabbed his pen, and triumphantly, he      scribbled his definitive answer:
<P>
          4. Available in attractive containers of varying sizes.
<P>
      He received an A.

                                      A  man  fell asleep on the beach under the noonday sun and suffered a      severe  sunburn  and  heatstroke.  He was taken to the hospital where      his  skin was a bright red, painful and started to blister.  Anything      that  touched  him caused agony.  The Doctor attending him prescribed      continuous  intravenous  feeding  of  water  and electrolytes, a mild      sedative  and  Viagra.   "What  good  will  Viagra  do  him  in  that      condition?" the nurse inquired.  "It will keep the sheet off of him,"      replied the doctor.

      <CENTER>Diary of a Viagra Housewife</CENTER>
<P>
        Day 1.
<P>
        Just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary with not much to        celebrate. When it came time to re-enact our wedding night, he        locked himself in the bathroom and cried.
<P>
        Day 2.
<P>
        Today, he says he has a big secret to tell me. He's impotent, he        says, and he wants me to be the first to know. Why doesn't he        tell me something I don't know! I mean, he actually thinks I        haven't noticed.
<P>
        Day 3.
<P>
        This marriage is in trouble. A woman has needs. Yesterday, I saw        a picture of Nelson's Column and burst into tears.
<P>
        Day 4.
<P>
       A miracle has happened! There's a new drug on the market that       will fix his 'problem.' It's called Viagra. I told him that if he       takes Viagra,things will be just like they were on our wedding       night. I think this will work.I replaced his Prozac with the       Viagra, hoping to lift something other than his mood.
<P>
       Day 5.
<P>
       What absolute bliss!!. I have never been so contented!!!!
<P>
       Day 6.
<P>
       Isn't life wonderful but it's difficult to write while he's doing       that.
<P>
        Day 7.
<P>
        This Viagra thing has gone to his head. No pun intended!        Yesterday, at Burger King, the manager asked me if I'd like a        Whopper. He thought they were talking about him. But, have to        admit it's very nice - I don't think I've ever been so happy.
<P>
        Day 8.
<P>
        I think he took too many over the weekend. Yesterday, instead of        mowing the lawn, he was using his new friend as a weed whacker.        I'm also getting a bit sore down there.
<P>
        Day 9.
<P>
        No time to write. He might catch me.
<P>
        Day 10.
<P>
        Okay, I admit it. I'm hiding. I mean, a girl can only take so        much. And to make matters worse, he's washing the Viagra down        with neat whisky! What am I going to do? I feel tacky all over....
<P>
        Day 11.
<P>
        I'm basically being screwed to death. It's like living with a        Black and Decker drill. I woke up this morning hot-glued to the        bed. Even my armpits hurt. He's a complete pig.
<P>
        Day 12.
<P>
        I wish he was gay. I've stopped wearing make-up, cleaning my        teeth or even washing but he still keeps coming after me! Even        yawning has become dangerous ...
<P>
        Day 13.
<P>
        Every time I shut my eyes, there's a sneak attack! It's like        going to bed with a scud missile. I can hardly walk and if he        tries that "Oops, sorry" thing again, I'll kill the bastard.
<P>
        Day 14.
<P>
        I've done everything to turn him off. Nothing is working. I even        started dressing like a nun but this just seems to make him more        horny. Help me.
<P>
        Day 15.
<P>
        I think I'll have to kill him. I'm starting to stick to        everything I sit on. The cat and dog won't go near him and our        friends don't come over any more. Last night I told him to go and        fk himself and he did.
<P>
        Day 16.
<P>
        The bastard has started to complain about headaches. I hope the        bloody thing explodes. I did suggest he might try stopping the        Viagra and going back on Prozac.
<P>
        Day 17.
<P>
        Switched the pills but it doesn't seem to have made any        difference......Christ !!! here he comes again.
<P>
        Day 18. He's back on Prozac. He just sits there in front         of the TV all day with that remote control in his hand and        expects me to do everything for him. What absolute bliss!!.
<P>
                               <CENTER> ================</CENTER>
<P>
                          <CENTER>Ladies---Eat More Chocolate!</CENTER>
<P>
      Chocolate  is a vegetable and should be included in your meals daily.      How,  you  ask?   Chocolate  is  derived  from  cacao  beans.  Bean =      vegetable.
<P>
      Sugar  is  derived  from  either sugar CANE or sugar BEETS.  Both are      plants, which places them in the vegetable category.  Thus, chocolate      is a vegetable.
<P>
      To go one step further, chocolate candy bars also contain milk, which      is dairy.  So candy bars are a health food.
<P>
      Chocolate  covered  raisins, cherries, orange slices and strawberries      all count as fruit, so eat as many as you want.
<P>
      If  you've got melted chocolate all over your hands, you're eating it      too slowly.
<P>
      The problem:  How to get 2 pounds of chocolate home from the store in      a hot car.  The solution:  Eat it in the parking lot.
<P>
      Diet tip:  Eat a chocolate bar before each meal.  It'll take the edge      off your appetite, and you'll eat less.
<P>
      If  calories are an issue, store your chocolate on top of the fridge.      Calories  are  afraid  of  heights,  and  they  will  jump out of the      chocolate to protect themselves.
<P>
      If I eat equal amounts of dark chocolate and white chocolate, is that      a balanced diet?  Don't they actually counteract each other?
<P>
      Chocolate  has  many  preservatives.   Preservatives  make  you  look      younger.  Therefore, you need to eat more chocolate.
<P>
      Put  "eat  chocolate"  at the top of your list of things to do today.      That way, at least you'll get one thing done.
<P>
      A  nice  box  of  chocolates  can  provide your total daily intake of      calories in one place.  Now, isn't that handy?
<P>
      If  you  can't  eat  all your chocolate, it will keep in the freezer.      But if you can't eat all your chocolate, what's wrong with you?
<P>
      If  not  for  chocolate,  there  would  be  no  need  for control top      pantyhose.   An  entire  garment  industry  would be devastated.  You      can't let that happen, can you?
<P>
                              <CENTER> ===================</CENTER>
<P>
      A couple of redneck hunters, Clifford and Bubba, are out in the woods      when  suddenly  Clifford  falls to the ground.  He doesn't seem to be      breathing, his eyes are rolled back in his head.
<P>
      Bubba  whips  out  his  cell  phone  and  calls 911.  He gasps to the      operator, "My friend is dead!  What can I do?"
<P>
      The  operator,  in a calm soothing voice says, "Just take it easy.  I      can help.
<P>
      First, lets make sure he's dead."
<P>

      Grandma  and  Grandpa  were  watching  a  healing service on TV.  The      evangelist  called  to  all who wanted to be healed to go to their TV      set,  place  one  hand  on the TV and the other hand on the body part      where they wanted to be healed.
<P>
      Grandma got up and slowly hobbled to the TV, placed her right hand on      the  set and her left hand on her arthritic shoulder that was causing      her to have great pain.
<P>
      Then Grandpa got up, went to the TV, placed his right hand on the set      and his left hand on his crotch.
<P>
      Grandma scowled at him and said, "I guess you just don't get it.  The      purpose of doing this is to heal the sick, not to raise the dead.

                                 <CENTER>Defense Lawyer </CENTER>
<P>
      A lawyer defending a man accused of burglary tried a creative defense      to  get  his  client  off  the hook.  "My client," he told the judge,      "merely  inserted  his  arm  into the window and removed a few paltry      items.   His  arm is not himself, so I fail to see how you can punish      the whole individual for an offense committed solely by his arm."
<P>
      "Well put," the judge replied with a grin.  "Using that same logic, I      sentence the defendant's arm to one year's imprisonment.  Your client      can  accompany  the arm or not, as he chooses." The defendant smiled.      With  his  lawyer's help, he detached his artificial limb, laid it on      the  bench,  and  walked out.

      There  was  this  guy  who went golfing every Saturday and Sunday, it      didn't  matter what kind of weather it was he was always hooked up on      a round of golf on his days off.
<P>
      One  Saturday he left the house early and headed for the golf course,      but  it  was so bitter cold that he decided he wouldn't golf that day      and went back home.
<P>
      His  wife  was  still  in  bed  when he got there, so he took off his      clothes  and  snuggled  up  to his wife's backside and said "Terrible      weather out there."
<P>
      She  replied,  "Yeah,  and  can  you  believe  my stupid husband went      golfing."

       My  first  job  was  working  in  an  orange juice factory, but I got      canned...  couldn't concentrate. 
<P>
      Then  I  worked  in  the woods as a lumberjack, but I just couldn't      hack it, so ..  .they gave me the axe. 
<P>
      After that I tried to be a tailor, but I just wasn't suited for it.      Mainly because...  it was a so-so job.
<P>
      Next I tried working in a muffler factory but that ...was exhausting. 
<P>
      I wanted to be a barber, but ...I just couldn't cut it. 
<P>
      Then I tried to be a chef -- figured it would add a little spice to      my life but I just...  didn't have the thyme. 
<P>
      I  attempted  to  be  a  deli  worker,  but  any way I sliced it, I      ...couldn't cut the mustard.
<P>
      My best job was being a musician, but eventually I found...  I wasn't      noteworthy.
<P>
      I  studied  a  long  time to become a doctor, but I...didn't have any      patients. 
<P>
      Next  was  a job in a shoe factory; I tried but I...just didn't fit      in.
<P>
      I  became a professional fisherman, but discovered that I ...couldn't      live on my net income.
<P>
      Thought about becoming a witch, so I ...tried that for a spell.
<P>
      I  managed  to get a good job working for a pool-maintenance company,      but the work was ...just too draining.
<P>
      I  got  a  job  at  a  zoo feeding giraffes but I was fired because I      just...wasn't up to it. 
<P>
      So  then I got a job in a fitness-center, but they said I ...wasn't      fit for the job. 
<P>
      Next,  I  found  being an electrician interesting, but the work was      shocking and I ...was discharged. 
<P>
      After  many years of trying to find steady work I finally got a job      as a historian until I realized there was ...no future in it. 
<P>
      My  last  job  was  working at Starbucks, but I had to quit because      it...was always the same old grind. 
<P>
<CENTER>SO I RETIRED AND I FOUND I'M A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS JOB!</CENTER>

      "Well,  it was like this," said the man.  "I was having a quiet round      of golf with my wife when she sliced her ball into a pasture of cows.
<P>
      "We went to look for it and while I was rooting around, I noticed one      of the cows had something white at its rear end.
<P>
      "I  walked  over and lifted up the tail and sure enough, there was my      wife's  golf  ball...stuck  right  in  the  middle of the cow's butt.      That's when I made my mistake."
<P>
      "What did you do?" asks the doctor.
<P>
      "Well, I lifted the tail and yelled to my wife, 'Hey, this looks like      yours!'"
