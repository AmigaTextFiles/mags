      Santa  was  very  cross.   It was Christmas Eve and NOTHING was going      right.   Mrs.Claus  had  burned  all  the  cookies.   The  elves were      complaining  about  not getting paid for the overtime they had worked      while  making the toys.  The reindeer had been drinking all afternoon      and were dead drunk.
<P>
      To  make  matters  worse,  they  had  taken the sleigh out for a spin      earlier  in  the  day  and  had  crashed  it  into a tree.  Santa was      furious.
<P>
      "I  can't  believe  it!  I've got to deliver millions of presents all      over  the  world  in just a few hours...all of my reindeer are drunk,      the  elves  are  on strike and I don't even have a Christmas tree!  I      sent  that  stupid  Little  Angel out HOURS ago to find a tree and he      isn't even back yet!  What am I going to do?"
<P>
      Just  then the Little Angel opened the front door and stepped in from      a  snowy  night,  dragging  a Christmas tree.  He says, "Yo, fat man!      Where do you want me to stick the tree this year?"
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      And  so  it  came  to  pass  ...   the  tradition  of angels atop the      Christmas trees was begun.

<P>
      Pfizer  Drug  has announced that their popular drug, Viagra, will now      be  available  in  liquid  form.   It will be marketed under the name      Mydixadud.   It  will  now  be  possible for a man to go home after a      tough day at the office and literally pour himself a stiff one.

<FONT COLOR=magenta>                                THE IRISH FARMER<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  female  TV  reporter  from  RTE went to interview Seamus Feeney, a      farmer from Galway, about Mad Cow disease.
<P>
      Herself:   Good evening Sir, we are here to collect information about      the  reasons behind Mad Cow Disease.  Do you have any idea what might      be the reason ?
<P>
      Seamus  stared  at the reporter and said, " Do you know that the bull      rides that cow once a year?
<P>
      The  Lady  (getting  embarrassed):  " Well sir, that's a new piece of      information,  but what's the relation between this phenomenon and Mad      Cow Disease?"
<P>
      Seamus:   Well  now  Madam,  do you know that we milk the cow twice a      day?
<P>
      The  Lady :  Sir, this is really valuable information, but what about      getting to the point ?
<P>
      The Farmer :  I'm getting to the point Madam.  Just imagine, if I was      playing  with  your  tits  twice  a  day  and  only riding you once a      year, wouldn't you go fuing mad?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=magenta>                                  THE IRISH PUB<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  Scotsman,  an  Italian,  and  an  Irishman are in a bar.  They are      having a good time and all agree that the bar is a nice place.
<P>
      Then  the  Scotsman  says, "Aye, this is a nice bar, but where I come      from,  back in Glasgee, there's a better one.  At MacDougal's, ye buy      a  drink,  ye  buy  another drink, and MacDougal himself will buy yir      third drink!"
<P>
      The others agree that sounds like a good place.
<P>
      Then the Italian says, "Yeah, dat's a nice bar, but where I come from      dere's  a  better  one.   In Roma, dere's this place, Vincenzo's.  At      Vincenzo's,  you  buy  a  drink,  Vincenzo buys you a drink.  You buy      anudda drink, Vincenzo buys you anudda drink."
<P>
      Everyone agrees that sounds like a great bar.
<P>
      Then the Irishman says, "You tink dat's great?  Where Oi come from in      Dublin,  dere's dis place called Morphy's.  At Morphy's, they boy you      your  forst  drink,  dey  boy you your second drink, dey boy you your      tird drink, and den, dey take you in de back and get you laid!"
<P>
      "Wow!"  say  the  other  two.   "That's fantastic!  Did that actually      happen to you?"
<P>
      "No," says the Irish guy, "but it happened to me sister!"
