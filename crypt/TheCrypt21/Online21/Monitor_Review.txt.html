<FONT COLOR=white>      Belinea 10 30 80 17" SVGA Monitor      Available From: Eyetech Group      Price: £299.95
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      This monitor is manufactured by Belinea who are based in Germany, and      are responsible for making some good quality monitors.
<P>
      One  thing  often  overlooked  when  expanding  ones  Amiga  is  your      computers  monitor.   Back  in  the old days of Amiga computing, most      Amiga  users  relied on RGB monitors such as the Philips CM8833 MK 1,      and  MK 2, and Commodores 1083S.  Although ideal, these monitors only      supported  a standard RGB signal and were not capable of running SVGA      modes.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  Belinea  10 30 80 supports the following horizontal and vertical      scan  rates  30  - 96 kHz horizontal, 50-60 Hz vertical and a maximum      resolution of 1920 x 1440 pixels.  Ideal for graphics cards users and      you  can  enjoy a quality display with no eye strain.  A scan doubler      is  required  should  you wish to display AGA/ECS screen modes, since      the  Amiga's standard 15 kHz video signal is too low to be displayed.      If  you have a graphics card and a Cybervision 64/3D you will require      Eyetech's  AMON  video switcher as well for automatic video switching      between   the  Amiga  native  AGA  screen  modes  (from  an  internal      scandoubler) and the output from your graphics card.
<P>
      There  are only three controls on the front of the monitor:  pressing      the  'Enter'  button  on  the front of the monitor allows the user to      bring  up  the  control panel for adjusting the image.  Navigation of      the  control  panel menu is performed by a thumb wheel control at the      front  of  the  monitor.  It is possible to change the language, Zoom      (picture  size),  horizontal  and  vertical  position  of the screen,      adjust the side curves of the screen, adjust the colour, and reset to      factory   default  settings.   Since  when  moving  the  most  modern      monitors,  the magnetic field in the CRT can be disturbed, distorting      the  display,  a  'degauss'  option can be accessed as well under the      'Extra Controls' menu, selecting this, and the monitor screen wobbles      and clunks to degauss the CRT.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  Belinea 10 30 80 also utilizes a VESA DPMS energy feature.  This      is  similar  to a standard screen blanker, but is slightly different:      it  switches  off  the monitor's CRT.  This conserves electricity and      helps to preserve the life expectancy of the monitor when not in use.      When  this  feature  is active, and the CRT is turned off completely,      the  monitor  only uses 3 watts.  You will of course require software      to  utilize  this feature such as MCP, or DPMSManager (both available      from Aminet).

<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Minus Points:-<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      - <FONT COLOR=cyan>The back of the monitor's CRT is rather large:  make sure you have        enough desk space.<FONT COLOR=white>      -<FONT COLOR=cyan> Scandoubler  required  if you wish to use standard AGA / ECS modes        with Amiga.<FONT COLOR=white>      - <FONT COLOR=cyan>If your using a graphics card with this monitor and want to display      AGA modes as well, you will require a combined internal scandoubler /      flickerfixer fitted to your A1200's motherboard, as well as Eyetech's      AMON automatic video switching device.
