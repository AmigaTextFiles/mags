      Well  as  I  sit  and  write this, Just a few days from Christmas and      obviously just over a week of this year remaining, Perhaps its a good      time to glance over our shoulder and see what has transpired over the      past 12 months.
<P>
      Certainly the year 2001 has not been good for the Average Amiga user.      Two body blows hits us (1) The Announcement that the AmigaOne was not      be  released  this  year  (2)  The announcement that the Amiga Active      Magazine  would  be  renamed  as  "Digital"  and  would not cover the      Classic Amiga Computer.
<P>
      So!  as we face the Year Ahead ...  We have no recognised Amiga Print      Magazine,  and  only the Promise of a New Machine ..Sadly one that we      have  not yet seen working.  The Releases of Software for the Classic      range  of  Amiga  Computers  has virtually dried up.  Even if someone      decided  to  write a "Blockbuster" of a game ...The lack of a Printed      Magazine  means  little  or  no  advertising, No advertising means no      sales  ..   And  so  we  join  the Merry-go-round of certain and sure      demise of the Platform.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Each  day  on  the  Amiga  Mailing  lists,  More  and More people are      reporting  they  are  moving  on  to  buy a PC, Yes we still have the      Diehards  the  Fanatics  but for the General Computer user, Sadly the      Amiga as we know it is going under for the Third time.
<P>
      Perhaps  the coming 12 months WILL provide us with a new machine, But      is it to late ...Sadly I fear so ...  Those that have spent out £1000      on  a PC will not readily sell up and buy a new Amiga.  The remainder      of  the  User base must now be so small that even if we all bought an      AmigaOne  ...We  would still be a drop in the Ocean of Computer Users      ...  NOT the Ideal situation to attract developers and Programmers to      the Platform.
<P>
      If  the  Amiga  cannot attract New and "Kick Arse" Software, Then the      future is Surely demise.
<P>
      I Myself have taken the decision that many have!  ..  Yes I will keep      my A1200 ..  Yes I will continue using it ..  No!  ..I will not spend      any  more  money  upgrading  it.   When the day comes that my machine      breaks  down  ..  Sadly that is it ..  Any good bits will be sold off      and bad bits destined for the bin.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      I really do hope that in the coming months, Amiga prove me wrong, and      should the AmigaOne be something very special ..  Then I will happily      order  one  ..   However Computers are moving forward at a tremendous      rate  of development ...We are so far behind that playing catch up is      nigh impossible.
<P>
      We  at <FONT COLOR=green> RIYAN  Productions<FONT COLOR=cyan>  ..   Will  continue to try to support the      Classic Amiga ..However with so little to actually write about ..  We      to have to start to include more regarding other platforms.
<P>
      Let  us hope!  that in 12 months time, My editorial will be all about      the  Success of the New Amiga ...  About all the New software that is      due for release.
