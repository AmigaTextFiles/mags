                                  <CENTER>By Ian Urie</CENTER>
<P>
      I  saw  this  bloke  chatting up a cheetah, I thought "he's trying to      pull a fast one".
<P>
      So  I  said  to  this  train driver "I want to go to Paris".  He said      "Eurostar?".  I said "I've been on telly but I'm no Dean Martin". 
<P>
      So I said to the Gym instructor "Can you teach me to do the splits?".      He said "How flexible are you?".  I said "I can't make Tuesdays". 
<P>
      But  I'll  tell  you what I love doing more than anything:  trying to      pack myself in a small suitcase.  I can hardly contain myself. 
<P>
      Now  you  know  those trick candles that you blow out and a couple of      seconds  later they come alight again, well the other day there was a      fire at the factory that makes them. 
<P>
      So  I  met  this gangster who pulls up the back of people's pants, it      was Weggie Kray. 
<P>
      So  I  said "Do you want a game of Darts?", he said "OK then", I said      "Nearest  to  bull  starts".   He  said  "Baa", I said "Moo", he said      "You're closest". 
<P>
      You  see  I'm against hunting, in fact I'm a hunt saboteur.  I go out      the night before and shoot the fox. 
<P>
      The  other  day I sent my girlfriend a huge pile of snow.  I rang her      up, I said "Do you get my drift?". 
<P>
      So  I  went  down  the  local  supermarket,  I said "I want to make a      complaint,  this  vinegar's  got  lumps  in  it",  he said "Those are      pickled onions". 
<P>
      So  I went to the Chinese restaurant and this duck came up to me with      a  red  rose  and  says  "Your  eyes  sparkle like diamonds".  I said      "Waiter, I asked for a-ROMATIC duck". 
<P>
      Now  did you know if a stick insect laid it's eggs in a jar of Bovril      it will give birth to a litter of twiglets. 
<P>
      So  this  bloke  says to me, "Can I come in your house and talk about      cleaning your carpets?".  I thought "That's all I need, a Je-hoover's      witness". 
<P>
      So  I  rang  up  British Telecom, I said "I want to report a nuisance      caller", he said "Not you again". 
<P>
      So  I  was  having  dinner  with Garry Kasporov and there was a check      tablecloth.  It took him two hours to pass me the salt.  He said "You      remind me of a pepper-pot", I said "I'll take that as a condiment". 
<P>
      Now  did  you  know  all male tennis players are witches, for example      Goran, even he's a witch. 
<P>
      And I've got a friend who's fallen in love with two school bags, he's      bisatchel. 
<P>
      So  a lorry-load of tortoises crashed into a train-load of terrapins,      I thought "That's a turtle disaster".
<P>
                                  <CENTER>A Good Moral  </CENTER>
<P>
                The teacher gave her fifth-grade class an           assignment. Get their parents           to tell them a story with a moral in it.   
<P>
           Next day, Kathy said, "My father's a           farmer, and we have a lot of egg-laying           hens.           One time we were taking eggs to market in a           box on  the front seat of the truck, when we hit a           bump  and a lot of them  broke and made a mess."   
<P>
           "So, what's the moral of the           story," asked the teacher.   
<P>
           "Don't put all your eggs in one basket."   
<P>
           Another child, Lucy, told her story. "Our           family are farmers too. But we raise           chickens  for the meat market. We had 16 eggs one           time, but  when they hatched, we only got 10 live           chicks.   
<P>
           And the moral to this story is:            don't count your chickens until they  hatch."   
<P>
           "That was fine," said the teacher.   
<P>
           "Now, Johnny, do you have a story too?"   
<P>
           "Yes, ma'am. My daddy told me about my Aunt           Karen. She was a flight engineer in           Desert  Storm in Iraq--and her plane got hit. She           had  to bail out over enemy territory. All she           had was  a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a           machete.   
<P>
           She drank the whiskey on the way down so it           wouldn't break.  Then she landed in the middle of 20           enemy  troops. She killed 15 with the machine gun,           but then  it jammed.  She hacked 3 more with the           machete until the blade broke. And she killed the last 2           with her  bare hands."   
<P>
          "Good heavens!" exclaimed the horrified          teacher. "What  kind of moral did your daddy          tell you was in this terrible  story?"   
<P>
          "Don't fuck with Aunt Karen when she's been          drinking."

                                       A judge was interviewing a lady regarding her pending divorce, and he      asked her, "What are the grounds for your divorce?"
<P>
      She  replied,  "About four acres and a nice little home in the middle      of the property with a stream running by."
<P>
      "No," he said, "I mean what is the foundation of this case?"
<P>
      "Why, it is made of concrete, of course," she responded.
<P>
      "I mean," he continued, "what are your relations like?"
<P>
      "I  have  an  aunt  and  uncle  living  here  in  town, as well as my      husband's parents."
<P>
      He said, "Do you have a real grudge?"
<P>
      "No,"  she  replied, "we have a two-car carport and have never really      needed one."
<P>
      "Please," he tried again, "is there any infidelity in your marriage?"
<P>
      "Yes,   both  my  son  and  daughter  have  stereo  sets.   We  don't      necessarily  like  the  music,  but  the  answer  to your question is      'yes'."
<P>
      "Ma'am, does your husband ever beat you up?"
<P>
      "Yes,"  she  responded, "about twice a week he gets up earlier than I      do."
<P>
      Finally,  frustrated  and  at  the  end of his rope, the judge asked,      "Lady, why do you want a divorce?"
<P>
      "Oh,  I  don't  want  a  divorce," she replied.  "I've never wanted a      divorce.   It's  my  husband that does.  He says he can't communicate      with me."

                                        Little  Johnny  and  Susie  are only 10 years old, but they just know      that  they  are  in  love.  One day they decide that they want to get      married, so Johnny  goes  to  Susie's father to ask him for her hand.      Johnny bravely walks up to him and says
<P>
      "Mr.   Smith, me and Susie are in love and I'm asking for her hand in      marriage."
<P>
      Thinking  that  this  was the cutest thing, Mr.  Smith replies, "Well      Johnny, you are only 10.  Where will you two live?"
<P>
      Without  even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replies.  "In      Susie's  room.   It's  bigger  than  mine  and  we can both fit there      nicely."
<P>
      Still  thinking  this  is  just adorable, Mr.  Smith says with a huge      grin,  "Okay  then how will you live?  You're not old enough to get a      job.  You'll need to support Susie."
<P>
      Again, Johnny instantly replies, "Our allowance...Susie makes 5 bucks      a  week  and  I make 10 bucks a week.  That's about 60 bucks a month,      and that should do us just fine."
<P>
      By  this  time  Mr.  Smith is a little shocked that Johnny has put so      much thought into this.  So, he thinks for a moment trying to come up      with  something that Johnny won't have an answer to.  After a second,      Mr.   Smith says, "Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything      all  figured out, just have one more question for you.  What will you      do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?"
<P>
      Johnny  just  shrugs  his  shoulders and says "That's okay, I'll just      keep shagging her up the arse for now..."

                                       <CENTER> This  was  in  the  Washington  Post...  the title of the article was      "Best Comeback Line Ever."</CENTER>
<P>
      In summary, the police arrested Patrick Lawrence, a 22-year-old white      male,  resident  of  Dacula, GA, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 p.m.  on      Friday.  Lawrence will be charged with lewd and lascivious behaviour,      public  indecency,  and  public  intoxication  at the Gwinnett County      courthouse on Monday.
<P>
      The  suspect  explained  that  as  he  was passing a pumpkin patch he      decided  to  stop.   "You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside,      and there was no one around here for miles.  At least I thought there      wasn't," he stated in a phone interview.
<P>
      Lawrence  went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road,      picked  out  a  pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes,      cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his "need." "I guess I was      just   really   into   it,  you  know?"  he  commented  with  evident      embarrassment.
<P>
      In  the  process,  Lawrence  apparently  failed  to notice a Gwinnett      County  police  car approaching and was unaware of his audience until      officer  Brenda Taylor approached him.  "It was an unusual situation,      that's  for  sure,"  said officer Taylor.  "I walked up to (Lawrence)      and  he's...just  working  away  at  this pumpkin." Taylor went on to      describe what happened when she approached Lawrence.  "I just went up      and  said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realise that you are  a      pumpkin?"  He  froze and was clearly very surprised that I was there,      and  then  looked  me  straight  in  the  face  and said, "A pumpkin?      Damn...is it midnight already?'".

                                        Madonna,  Rod  Stewart  and Elton John are out for an evening stroll.      Whilst  walking  past  the  local school, Madonna trips up and falls,      wedging  her  head  firmly between the school railings.  Rod Stewart,      not  being  one to miss an opportunity decides he isn't going to miss      this one and, unzipping his tartan pants takes Madonna from behind.
<P>
      Giving  it  plenty, Rod turns to Elton and says 'Do you fancy a go of      this when I'm finished?'
<P>
       'I'd  love to....' replied Elton.....'but I don't think my head will      fit through the railings'.

<P>
      The  teacher  says,  "Whoever  answers  the questions I ask first and      correctly can leave early today.
<P>
      Little  Johnny says to himself, "Good, I want to get outta here.  I'm      clever, that answer's mine!"
<P>
      The teacher asked, "Who said 'Four Score and Seven Years Ago?
<P>
      Before Johnny could open his  mouth, Susie  said, "Abraham Lincoln!"
<P>
      The teacher said, "That's right, Susie.  You may  leave."
<P>
      Johnny was mad.  Susie had answered first.
<P>
      The teacher asked, "Who said, 'I Have a Dream?"
<P>
      Before Johnny could open his mouth, Mary  said,  "Martin Luther King!"
<P>
      The teacher said, "That's right, Mary. You  may leave."
<P>
      Johnny was even madder than before. Mary had answered first.
<P>
      The  teacher  asked, "Who said 'Ask not, what your country can do for      you?'
<P>
      Before Johnny could open his mouth, Nancy said, "John F.  Kennedy".
<P>
      The teacher said, "That's right, Nancy. You may leave."
<P>
      Johnny was fuming.  Nancy had  answered first.
<P>
      As  the  teacher sat down, Johnny muttered, "I wish those bitches had      kept their mouths shut!"
<P>
      The shocked teacher asked,  "Who said  that?!!!?"
<P>
      Johnny jumped up and hollered, "Bill Clinton!!!  See you Monday!"

                                        The  Reverend  John  Flapps was a pastor of a small congregation in a      little Pennsylvanian town.
<P>
      One  day  he was walking down Main Street and he happened to notice a      female  member  of his congregation sitting in the town bar, drinking      beer.
<P>
      The  reverend  thought  this was sinful and not something a member of      his  congregation  should do.  He walked through the open door of the      bar and sat down next to the woman.
<P>
      "Mrs.  Fitzgerald," the reverend said sternly.  "This is no place for      a member of my congregation.  Why don't you let me take you home?"
<P>
      "Sure," she said with a slur, obviously very drunk.
<P>
      When  Mrs.  Fitzgerald stood up from the bar, she began to weave back      and forth.
<P>
      The  reverend  realized  that  she  had  had too much to drink and he      grabbed  her  arms  to steady her.  When he did, they both lost their      balance and tumbled to the floor.
<P>
      After  rolling around for a few seconds, the reverend wound up laying      on  top  of  Mrs.   Fitzgerald, her skirt hiked up to her waist.  The      bartender  looked  over the bar and said, "Here, here buddy, we won't      have any of that carrying around in this bar!"
<P>
      The  reverend  looked  up  at  the bartender and said, "But you don't      understand, I'm Pastor Flapps"
<P>
      The bartender nodded and said, "Hell then, if you're that far in, you      might as well finish up."

                                        An  Australian  man  was having coffee and croissants with butter and      jam in a cafe when an American tourist, chewing gum, sat down next to      him.The  Australian politely ignored the American, who, nevertheless,      started up a conversation.
<P>
      The  American  snapped his gum and said, "You Australian folk eat the      whole bread?"
<P>
      The  Australian  frowned,  annoyed  with  being  bothered  during his      breakfast, and replied, "Of course."
<P>
      The  American blew a huge bubble.  "We don't.  In the States, we only      eat  what's  inside.   The  crusts we collect in a container, recycle      them, transform them into croissants and sell them to Australia." The      American  had  a  smirk  on  his  face.   The  Australian listened in      silence.  The American persisted.  "D'ya eat jam with the bread?"
<P>
      Sighing, the Australian replied, "Of course."
<P>
      Cracking his gum between his teeth, the American said, "We don't.  In      the  States,  we  eat  fresh fruit for breakfast, then we put all the      peels,  seeds,  and  leftovers in containers, recycle them, transform      them into jam and sell it to Australia."
<P>
      The Australian then asked, "Do you have sex in the States?"
<P>
      The  American  smiled and said, "Why of course we do." The Australian      leaned  closer to him and asked, "And what do you do with the condoms      once you've used them?"
<P>
      "We  throw them away, of course." Now it was the Australian's turn to      smile.
<P>
      "We  don't.   In Australia, we put them in a container, recycle them,      melt  them  down into chewing gum and sell them to the United States.      "Why do you think it's called Wrigley's?"

                                        A  chap  asks  a  prostitute  for  a shag and she tells him it's £20.      "Fine" he says, "but I'm a bit kinky".
<P>
      She agrees that this is OK as long as he doesn't do anything violent.      They  get  back to her flat and he gets out four big springs attached      to some straps.
<P>
      "I  want  you to put one of these on each elbow and one on each knee"      he asks.
<P>
      The  prostitute  is  worried  that she's getting into something a bit      heavy, but she goes along with his request.
<P>
      Then  she  is  told  to get down on all fours, naked, in front of him      which she does grudgingly.  Then he asks her to start bouncing up and      down  on  the springs and finally he takes duck call whistle from his      pocket.
<P>
      "Blow on this while I'm shagging you" he tells her.
<P>
      So  he's  banging away at her from behind while she's bouncing on the      springs blowing the duck whistle.
<P>
      Suddenly  she  starts  to enjoy the shagging, so much so that she has      the most fantastic orgasm she's ever had.
<P>
      After they've finished she says
<P>
      "Wow,  that  was  the  most fantastic sex I've had in 25 years on the      game, how the hell did you make it so good?"
<P>
      "Ah," he replies, "It's Foursprung Duck Technique".  :-)))

<P>
      "It`s a beautiful day and love is in the air.

      Marie leans over to Pierre and says, "Pierre , kiss me."

      Our hero grabs a bottle of Merlot and splashes it on Marie`s lips.

      "What are you doing Pierre?" says the startled Marie.
<P>
      "I am Pierre the fighter pilot.  When I have red meat, I like to have      red wine!"
<P>
      She  smiles  and  they start kissing.  When things began to heat up a      little,
<P>
      Marie says, "Pierre, kiss me lower."
<P>
      Our  hero  tears  her  blouse  open, grabs a bottle of Chardonnay and      starts pouring it all over breasts.
<P>
      "Pierre, what are you doing?" asks the bewildered Marie.
<P>
      "I am Pierre the fighter pilot, and when I have white meat, I like to      have white wine."
<P>
      They  resume their passionate interlude and Marie begins to pant with      excitement.
<P>
      She leans close to his ear and whispers, "Pierre, kiss me lower.
<P>
      Our  hero  rips off her underwear, grabs a bottle of Cognac and pours      it in her lap.  He lights a match and puts it to the Cognac.

      Marie  shrieks  and dives into the river.  Standing waist deep, Marie      throws her arms upwards and screams furiously,

      "PIERRE, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING?!"

<P>
      The  first speaker from Canada stood up :  "At last year's conference      we  spoke  about being more assertive with our husbands.  Well, after      the conference I went home and told my husband that I would no longer      cook  for  him  and  that  he would have to do it himself.  After the      first  day  I saw nothing.  After the second day I still saw nothing.      But  after  the  third  day I saw hat he had cooked a wonderful roast      lamb."
<P>
      The crowd applauded.
<P>
      The  second  speaker  from  France  stood  up:   "After  last  year's      Conference  I went home and told my husband that I would no longer do      his laundry and that he would have to do it himself.  After the first      day  I  saw  nothing.  After the second day I saw nothing.  But after      the  third day I saw that he had done not only his own washing but my      washing as well."
