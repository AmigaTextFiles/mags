<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>                      <CENTER>by the<FONT COLOR=yellow> Ferret<FONT COLOR=cyan> and the<FONT COLOR=green> Dungeon Master </CENTER>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  dank  Autumn  moon  broke  through the overhanging clouds in the      night  sky,  sending  a  shimmering  finger of pale light towards the      quiet  earth,  eventually  landing  at  a  small  burrow  on a lonely      Scottish hillside. 
<P>
      Highlighted  in  the moonbeam a small nose twitched nervously, almost      as  if was tasting the night air.  Satisfied that the coast was clear      the  small  lithe body of the Ferret, scrambled from his hiding place      and scurried into the night. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The small pinpricks of the Ferret's eyes, followed a party of heavily      overdressed  small  children,  wandering  aimlessly  down the country      road.  Each child dress in strange garb and carrying a plastic bag. 
<P>
      As  the  children  passed the Ferret darted on to the road, following      the children.  Silently he closed in.  The children laughed and joked      with  each  other, unaware of the close presence of the small animal.      Then  the  Ferret was close enough to strike.  Darting forward at the      speed  of light the Fearless Ferret launched his razor sharp teeth at      the  nearest  plastic  bag.   In  seconds  a large hole appeared, The      innocent  children hadn't even noticed. They continued on their merry      way, leaving a trail of Nuts and Sweets lying in the road.
<P>
      A  meal  at  last!  ..  Thought the Ferret chewing on the monkey nut.      When  suddenly a small tinkle alerted every sense in his tough little      Body.  WHAT was that? 
<P>
      The  Ferret's little eyes searched the road.  Suddenly a small bright      object  caught  the passing moonlight.  What's that glistening on the      road?  ...The Ferret took two bounding steps, his eyes widened...  It      was a Shiny Penny. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Never  before  had the Ferret seen an object of such beauty.  The way      the  Moonlight  glinted  from  the  small coin, sent his little heart      racing.   He  could  feel  the  Thud  Thud  in  his  chest  as he sat      transfixed staring at his new found Treasure.
<P>
      Heart  bursting,  Blood  roaring  ...The  Ferret  could even hear the      roaring in his ears ....louder and Louder and LOUDER So loud the very      roadway seemed to shake. 
<P>
      Suddenly  the  Ferret  tore  his  gaze away from that Shiny Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan> and      glanced  sideways,  Just in time to see the Blazing Headlights of the      16 Ton Truck. 
<P>
      WUMP!   ...   The  Heavy Monster of Man rolled over the Small Ferret,      Crushing and Grinding his body into the small stones of the road. 
<P>
      As the Ferret's blood seeped quickly from his broken body, his small      weak  front  leg stretched forward, His small paw stroking the Shiny      Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan>. He drew his last breath ...And died. 
<P>
      As  his  soul  left his torn flesh and headed skywards, he, even in      spirit form could not resist one last glance at the little coin.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>       However!  a cloaked figure emerged from the bushes by the side of the      road.   The  crippled walk of an old Man stopped at the Ferrets body.      His  leg  lashed  out tumbling the remains into the ditch, as he bent      forward and picked up the Shiny<FONT COLOR=cyan> coin. 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>BawHaw<FONT COLOR=cyan>"... Shrieked the Cruel voice...The Dark cloak was cast off to      reveal the Dungeon Master.  His single Red Eye glanced skywards. 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>At  last  I  have  yer  Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...."<FONT COLOR=green>Yea little Baz-Turd Yea<FONT COLOR=cyan>" (Cackle      Cackle)   "<FONT COLOR=green>That'll  teach  you  to  be  greedy,  you  got  your  just      reward....Death and now I have the Shiny Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan>" (Cackle Cackle) 
<P>
      The  Dungeon  Master  spat  on the Shiny Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan> and polished it on his      cloak  before  carefully  putting in his pocket.  He looked back down      into the ditch where he had kicked the crushed body of the Ferret and      laughed an evil laugh.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>It's  all  mine now Ferret, all mine<FONT COLOR=cyan>", said the Dungeon Master as he      proceeded to cross the fields, heading towards his<FONT COLOR=red> Crypt<FONT COLOR=cyan>.
<P>
      Meanwhile back in the dark, dank and smelly ditch a tiny broken voice      was heard...<FONT COLOR=yellow> 
<P>
      BUT I shall return <FONT COLOR=cyan>(Vowed the Ferret)
<P>
      It  was  a  seethingly  Angry  Ferret  Spirit that reached the Golden      Warren  in the Sky!  Upon passing through the Golden Gates the Ferret      grabbed the first person he could find.
<P>
      Shaking this poor unfortunate by the front of his jacket, Ferret spat      into his face.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>I  got tae get back down to Earth, Dae Yea Hear me, I must go back!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"      he screamed. 
<P>
      The  poor unfortunate gazed into the evil yellow eyes of the raging      Ferret.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      "There is only ONE person can let you leave this place!"<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      "WHO? ....How do I find him"<FONT COLOR=cyan> ..Screamed the Demented Ferret<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      "It's  <FONT COLOR=red>THE  MASTER<FONT COLOR=white>  ..   He's  the One ..  He only appears once a day      ...He  should  be  here  in  a  few  minutes, But I warn you ...He is      ruthless  in  his  Rule ..  He can make you burn in<FONT COLOR=red> HELL<FONT COLOR=white> for eternity      should he take a dislike to you."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Suddenly  two  giant  doors  "<FONT COLOR=white>Creaked<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  and "<FONT COLOR=white>Squeaked<FONT COLOR=cyan>" as the Massive      hinges propelled the timber forward.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>He  Cometh<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  Screamed  the  Crowd  ...Suddenly  all  bar  the Ferret      collapsed on to their knees, rubbing their faces in the dirt floor.<FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      YOOO ...RIEEE!      YOOO...RIEE!      YOOO...RIEE!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      They chanted in unison<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      YOOO ...RIE! .... YOOO...RIE!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      Suddenly  from  those  hellish  Gates  appeared  a  vision  that  was      indescribable ... It was!<FONT COLOR=white> 
<P>
      THE YOOO...RIE<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>Right  then!"<FONT COLOR=cyan> Squeaked the voice ....  "<FONT COLOR=red>How come that furry wee baz-      turd  is  nae bowin and grovellin at ma feet " <FONT COLOR=cyan>...He said pointing to      the Ferret.
<P>

      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>YOOO...RIE"<FONT COLOR=cyan> said the Ferret ....  "<FONT COLOR=yellow>If yer that bluddy great ...Ye'll      send me back tae the earth right now!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"

      "<FONT COLOR=red>OH AYE ...  Yea Wizzened wee skunk ...and why should I dae that?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Cause I huv a Mission ....REVENGE!<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...Screamed the ferret. 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>HA  HA  HA  ....Aye<FONT COLOR=cyan>", laughed the YOO...RIE .."<FONT COLOR=red>We all have Missions      of Revenge, why should I let you go?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  ...
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>I  have  tae  get back and Sort out the Dungeon Master ...YOOO...RIE      ...He stole my Shiny Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan>" 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>WHIT?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  screamed  the  YOOO...RIE  ..."<FONT COLOR=red>But  he  already has 19 shiny      Pennies ...That means he has 21.<FONT COLOR=cyan>" 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>NAH!   Twenty  .....Christ  can yea no coont<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...Asked the irritated      Ferret.<FONT COLOR=cyan> 
<P>
      YOOO  ..RIE  removed his black leather gloves and started counting on      his fingers. 
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>SHITE!   ...I've only 10 ...OK I'll take yer word fur it Ferret, But      if  the  Dungeon  master  gets 21 Shiny Pennies<FONT COLOR=red>, he can take over the      World ....He must be stopped!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Send  me  back YOOO...RIE ...I'll stop the Evil Bazturd ....I'll eat      his heart oot, I'll, I'll..<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>AYE  AYE  OK!  Point taken....  Don't fail me Ferret or Ye'll surely      Burn in the Fires of HELL.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>Go Stop the Evil one from his quest of world domination.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>Oh!   ....And  hear ...Get me a Mcdonalds Cheeseburger when yer doon      there.<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Said the YOOO...RIE<FONT COLOR=magenta>
<P>
                            MEANWHILE BACK ON EARTH.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  Dungeon  Master crossed the field and headed into the dark woods      where lay the entrance to his <FONT COLOR=red>Crypt<FONT COLOR=cyan>.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>Have  you  been  up that bloody pub again",<FONT COLOR=cyan> screamed a female voice,      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>Look at the time, your dinners ruined and you haven't fed the hounds      yet"<FONT COLOR=cyan> she screamed.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>Nymph,  shut  your mouth for once and look at this"<FONT COLOR=cyan> said the Dungeon      Master as he produced the bright SHINY PENNY<FONT COLOR=cyan>.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>Christ<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said  Nymph,  "<FONT COLOR=magenta>We how have 20, do you know what that means?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"      her voice shaking with excitement.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>Aye<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  said the Dungeon Master, "<FONT COLOR=green>One MORE and we can control and rule      the entire world.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      The Bright SHINY PENNY<FONT COLOR=cyan> sparkled even in the dimly lit passages of<FONT COLOR=red> The      Crypt<FONT COLOR=cyan>  then  suddenly  a  loud  rumble could be felt from deep in the      bowels of the Earth.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  hounds started baying, (mainly because they hadn't been fed) and      lightning  bolts started to richocet of the walls of <FONT COLOR=red>The Crypt<FONT COLOR=cyan>. There      was one almighty flash of lightning followed by an ear splitting clap      of thunder and......
<P>
      Lucifer rose from the very bowels of the Earth in all his Evil Glory.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>GO  FORTH  DUNGEON MASTER<FONT COLOR=cyan>", he bellowed, "<FONT COLOR=white>Find that 21st SHINY PENNY<FONT COLOR=white>      and together we will rule the world.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>But  where would I look oh great master, which way would I go<FONT COLOR=cyan>" asked      the Dungeon Master.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>Go  WEST,<FONT COLOR=cyan>" bellowed Lucifer, "<FONT COLOR=white>Cross the Badlands and find the hamlet      of  Southampton<FONT COLOR=cyan>",  he  continued.   "<FONT COLOR=white>There  it  is rumoured lives the      WEBMASTER a mighty warrior called ZOLA.  He has the 21st SHINY PENNY<FONT COLOR=white>,      the  final  key to ultimate power....  Go now Dungeon Master and seek      out that coin.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>Oh  thank you oh great Lucifer<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said the Dungeon Master, "<FONT COLOR=green>I shall go      straight after dinner<FONT COLOR=cyan>"<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      "Fuck dinner<FONT COLOR=cyan>", bellowed Lucifer, "<FONT COLOR=white>Go NOW, there is no time to waste"
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>                              WOOOSH .....KERPLUNK!
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>OUCH  YA  BUGGER!<FONT COLOR=cyan>".....   screamed  the  Ferret  as  he hit the hard      ground.
<P>
      Looking  skywards  he  screamed  ....   "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Kin  yea  no be more careful      YOOO...RIE ..  Yea dammed near broke ma neck!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      The Heavens crackled with the voice of the YOOO...RIE
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=red>Ghosts  don't  feel  pain  ...Yea must be alive again ...So stop yer      bluddy Moaning!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      Sheech!  Touchy bugger ...Thought Ferret ...Looking around him.
<P>
      Where the hell am I ?
<P>
      Suddenly  a  small  head appeared over the Drystane Dyke ...A curious      looking fella wearing a green hat.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>Helloo!<FONT COLOR=cyan>".....  Said the smiling face.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>WHO THE FECK ARE YOU?<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Asked a bemused Ferret.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>I'm the ELF of DYKE, Ray to his friends<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...He smiled.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>An ELF?<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said a startled ferret ....  "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Here!  Kin yea dae magic?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>What sort of magic?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  ...Asked the Elf
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Kin yea transport me?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  ...  Asked the excited Ferret
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>Oh!   Aye  ...One sweep of my Magic Crayon and you can be anywhere I      desire<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...  Laughed the magical Elf
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>Where do you want to go?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>I  need to find ZOLA<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...Said the Ferret ..."<FONT COLOR=yellow>He holds the last Shiny      Penny<FONT COLOR=yellow> ...He stays in a SOUTH-HAM-TIN.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=blue>Why does he stay in a HAM TIN?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  ...Enquired the Elf.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Don't  bluddy  know!   ...Why do you stay in a DYKE ...Look Pal Times      short, Kin yea Dae it or can yea No?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      POOOF! ...The Elf waved his magic Crayon
<P>
      SHLUUMP!  ...For the second time that day Ferret crashed heavily to      the Ground.
<P>
      Fer  feck  sake Man ...I wiz better aff Deid ....Muttered the Bruised      Ferret.
<P>
      Standing  up  and  brushing  down  his Dusty fur ...The Ferret looked      around.
<P>
      There  to  his left was a large sign saying SOUTH .....and right next      to that was a massive HAM-TIN
<P>
      SOUTH HAM-TIN ...This must be the place.  Thought the Ferret.
<P>
      The Ferret scurried forward and Knocked on the Tin Door.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>ARRRRGGGG!   ....WHO  Wakens  me  from  my  Slumber<FONT COLOR=cyan>" ...The door was      wrenched open.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Standing in the doorway was the massive frame of the Zola, decked out      in armour, a trickle of fresh blood running from his lips.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>Well,  Well,  Well ...It's the bluddy smelly Ferret ....What are you      doing here?<FONT COLOR=cyan>" asked the ZOLA
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>It's  the  DUNGEON  MASTER  ...ZOLA  ...He  stole  my  Shiny  Penny<FONT COLOR=cyan>"      Squeaked the Ferret
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>SO  ...It's  not my fault if you can't look after your Pennies<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Said      Zola
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>NO!  You don't understand ...He now has 20 Shiny Pennies ...ONE MORE      and...<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>OH!   CHRIST  ALMIGHTY<FONT COLOR=cyan>",  said  the  stricken ZOLA, "<FONT COLOR=white>He can rule the      World."
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Yes<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said Ferret "<FONT COLOR=yellow>And guess who holds that final Penny?<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>YEE GODS ...That Cloaked Nutter is coming for me<FONT COLOR=cyan>". said the ZOLA
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Yes!<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said the Ferret, "<FONT COLOR=yellow>but I have a cunning plan.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      Ferret  scrambled to the Zola's shoulder and whispered quietly in his      ear.
<P>
      Ferret and the Zola walked down the small lane until they reached the      local Tavern.
<P>
      The ferrets sharp little teeth easily made a hole in the Cellar door,      In  he  crawled,  shortly  to appear with a Gigantic bottle of Whisky      ....  The Tourist type ....Clad in a black felt jacket ...a sticky on      tartan kilt and stupid Tammy hat.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=white>JUST THE JOB!<FONT COLOR=cyan>", Said the ZOLA "<FONT COLOR=white>Good work Ferret.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      A hour later ..some miles from the Zola's home.
<P>
      The  Dungeon  Master,  cloak  flying in the wind marched purposefully      down the winding lane.
<P>
      Turning  the  sharp  left  corner  the  Dungeon  Master came upon two      Guisers.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>PENNY FOR THE GUY MISTER<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Said the smallest of the two.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>PISH  OFF<FONT COLOR=cyan>",  Screamed  the Dungeon Master pressing his evil one eyed      face into the Witches Mask.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>AH  COME  ON SIR ....JUST A PENNY FOR THE NICE GUY<FONT COLOR=cyan>".  Said the Child      pulling  the  cloth  off  the  old pram and revealing the tartan clad      bottle of Scotch.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>AH!<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Said the Dungeon Master ...The drool running down his chin ....
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>I'll  Give  you one Shiny Penny<FONT COLOR=green> for the GUY ....But I Want the GUY.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"      lobber slurp>
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>NO  WAY!<FONT COLOR=cyan>" Screamed the children ....  We want at least 5 pennies for      the GUY.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>FOUR SCREAMED<FONT COLOR=cyan>", the Dungeon Master, "<FONT COLOR=green>That's my final offer<FONT COLOR=cyan>".
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=magenta>DONE!<FONT COLOR=cyan>" said the Children.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "<FONT COLOR=green>ONE_TWO_THREE_FOUR  ...There  ...   4 Shiny Pennies ...  Now give me      that Bottl ...eh ....GUY.<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      The Children handed over their precious Guy.
<P>
      With  excited  and  trembling  fingers  the  Dungeon Master carefully      undressed the effigy of the Scotsman, and unscrewed the Metal cap.
<P>
      GLUG!....  GLUG!....GLUG!
<P>
      A  healthy  portion  of  the  Amber  nectar  flowed  easily  down the      Dungeon Masters throat.
<P>
      Wiping his lips with the hack of his hand, he belched loudly.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>HAH!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"  screamed  the  Ferret  ...Both  ZOLA and himself throwing off      their Costumes.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>Now  you  don't  have  enough  Shiny Pennies<FONT COLOR=yellow> to take over the World<FONT COLOR=cyan>"      ...Laughed the Ferret.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      "<FONT COLOR=green>HA!   HA!   HA!<FONT COLOR=cyan>",  Laughed the Dungeon Master, "<FONT COLOR=green>Maybe not ...But how      many  people  do  you know can get a Bottle of Whisky from a Scotsman      for only 4 pence<FONT COLOR=cyan>".
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>HA!  HA!  HA!<FONT COLOR=cyan>"
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>But  I  thought you wanted to take over the World<FONT COLOR=cyan>", asked a confused      Ferret
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>Aye,  but  I would need 21 Shiny Pennies to do that ....  I only had      19<FONT COLOR=cyan>".
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=yellow>You  had  20 ..You picked up one on the road ...I saw you<FONT COLOR=cyan>", Screamed      the Ferret.
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>NAH!   ...You  should have looked closer ...It was Chocolate wrapped      in foil ...A Childs Sweetie<FONT COLOR=cyan>".
<P>
      "<FONT COLOR=green>HA!  HA!  HA!  ....Yer conned again Ferret<FONT COLOR=cyan>" :)
<P>
      END.
