Yes my friends, it's that time of yearagain where we all  go  raving mad andspend  all  our  hard  earnt  money onfood, booze and presents.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I don't know about you  but I feel the"Magic  of  Christmas"  has  gone  nowdays. I could not help but notice thatsupermarkets   and   the   like   weredisplaying Christmas goodies  as earlyas the beginning of October!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Even  my  local   computer   shop  haddecided to jump on  the band wagon andhad put  up  decorations  and  bits offrigging tinsel around the monitors oftheir nice new Pentium powered PC's.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Sod all wrong with  that,  if it helpsto sell the  beasts,  but  NOT  at thebloody beginning of October!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
No,  I'm not a miserable old fart thatdetests  Christmas  and  all that goeswith it.  I am however pissed off withhaving Christmas shoved down my throatTHREE  soding  months before the eventby  EVERY shop in town.  They might aswell  start  displaying  Easter cards,after all April isn't that far off!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Sad really, isn't it?  What used to bea truly "Magic Time  Of  The Year" formost  people  has   turned  into  "onehideous commercial rip-off."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
And  we  are  all like bluddy lemmingsaren't  we?   We  rush out as soon theshops beckon us with their goodies andspend  as if there is no tomorrow.  Behonest with yourselves.  How many folkreading  this  haven't  already boughthalf their wares by November?<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Why do we do  it?  Because we have allbeen slowly conditioned  year  by yearby the  media,  shops  and  any  othermoney making bastard  that  profits byselling goods at Christmas.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Sales directors brief  their  staff asfar early as September on how and justhow early to launch Christmas upon thepublic, and  just  like  lemmings,  wefollow suit!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Even <FONT COLOR=red> The  CRYPT<FONT COLOR=cyan>  has  fallen  victim,after all if  it  wasn't for Christmasthen you  would  not  be  reading thisCryptmas Edition.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Oh well! Never  mind!  Christmas comesjust once a year even  if it does seemto arrive  earlier  each  time,  so  Ireckon it's time to  thank one and allfor the hard graft you  put in to yourcontributions and to say..
<P>
      <CENTER>MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE</CENTER>
