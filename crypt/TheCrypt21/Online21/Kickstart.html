<p align=justify>  Kickstart is an Amiga user group, formed in December 1997. We had our
                   initial meeting in March 1998 and we haven't looked back since. We
                   currently number over 70 full members, meeting every last Monday of
                   the month in Ottershaw, which is about 1 mile from junction 11 of the M25.
                   <p>
                   Our members have a wide variety of interests, which cover almost every use you
                   could possibly put the Amiga to. This was why Kickstart was formed, to help
                   others to learn more about and get more from their Amigas. We welcome anyone
                   from the serious user to the game player. So come along, Ottershaw is real
                   easy to get to.
