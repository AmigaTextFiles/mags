<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Requirements:   Playstation 2 memory card (in slot 1), some DVD discs      to  play.   Your television must support NTSC playback if you wish to      watch import DVD movies (Region 1).
<P>
      Here's  a  brilliant piece of kit for all those Playstation 2 owners.      As  most  of  you  will  already  be  aware,  DVD movie discs feature      'region' protection.  United Kingdom DVD players are region 2 encoded      and  only play region 2 DVD discs, the same applies for other regions      such  as  USA  and  Canada (Region 1).  A multi region DVD player can      cost hundreds of pounds if you want to play import DVD movies.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      DVD  Region X comprises of a CD-ROM not hardware modification to your      Playstation  2  needs  to be carried out whatsoever:  you simply boot      the  disc and the DVD Region X menu magically appears with 6 numbered      boxes.  Select the region for the DVD disc you wish to play, and your      Playstation  2's  disc  tray magically ejects itself.  Insert the DVD      disc you wish to watch, and press the eject button again to close the      tray.  You are then returned to the PS 2 browser screen, click on the      gold DVD disc icon and away you go.  You can now play all six regions      of DVD discs including import films as well.
<P>
      That  is  not  all,  DVD  Region X also banishes 'green' screen, when      playing  DVD  discs  through on your PS 2 through your standard scart      capable.
<P>
      I've tested a number of American DVD Region 1 discs and they all work      faultlessly.   At last I can finally watch my US Joe Satriani Live in      San  Francisco  concert  DVD which has only been released in Region 1      format  (US  and  Canada)!   A superior piece of kit for movie buffs.      When  you  consider  most new films are released in the States before      they  are  released  over here.  DVD Region-X is a must have piece of      kit.

<FONT COLOR=white>      Product:<FONT COLOR=yellow> Official Sony Playstation 2 DVD Remote Control Unit<FONT COLOR=white>      Price:<FONT COLOR=yellow> £19.95<FONT COLOR=white>      Available From:<FONT COLOR=yellow> Electronics Boutique and all good stockists.<FONT COLOR=white>      Requirements:<FONT COLOR=yellow> Playstation 2 memory card (in slot 1), some DVD discs                    to play.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      One  annoying  aspect  of playing DVD movies on your Playstation 2 is      having  to  use  your joypad to navigate through the DVD menu system.      It's  fiddly  and  trying  to  remember  what all the buttons do is a      nightmare.   There  are  quite  a  few third-party DVD remote control      units available for the Playstation 2, but Sony's 'official' 1 has to      be  the  best.   Included is Sony's DVD remote control unit 2xAA size      Sony  batteries  and  a  infra-red receiver (about the same size as a      standard  memory  card,  although slightly fatter), plugs into joypad      port  2,  and the new DVD driver (V2.10E) which comes on the CD which      is included.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Simply  plug  the infra red receiver into joypad port 2 of your PS 2,      insert  the  2xAA  batteries  into  the remote control unit, ensure a      memory  card  is inserted into memory card slot 1 and turn on your PS      2.   The  supplied  new DVD driver discs is then booted which is then      copied to your memory card this only needs to be done once.  Once the      new  DVD  driver  software (V2.10E) is copied to your Playstation 2's      memory card, you can reset and now enjoy the luxury of operating your      PS 2's DVD functions straight via the remote control.
