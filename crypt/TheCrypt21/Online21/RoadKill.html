<FONT COLOR=cyan>I  started  eating  road  kill about ayear  after Edith died.  After all, itwas  her  social  security cheque thatkept  us  in  groceries for those lastfew years.
<P>
I  had always felt bad about having todepend  on  her  for money to feed us.But there wasn't much I could do aboutit.   A  lifetime  of  odd jobs hadn'tleft me with much of a retirement fundand  we had to eat.  The pittance thatI  got  just about paid for this lousyramshackle    shack    out    by   theInterstate.   Her  cheque paid for thegroceries and medical bills.
<P>
No  one  seemed  to  want  to  hire  aseventy  two  year  old  handyman.  My
<P>
eyesight   was   failing,  my  musclesweren't  what  they  used  to be and Isometimes  forgot  what I was supposedto  be  working  on.  With Edith gone,money for food got awfully tight.
<P>
I  used  to  walk  the  Interstate forsomething   to   do,  trying  to  findsomething  interesting, when I noticeda    cow,   freshly   killed   by   anautomobile.   It  had  wandered out ofthe  pasture  and happened onto to theroad.   Now,  it didn't look nearly asgood  as the cellophane wrapped steaksdown  at  the  grocery  store.  But itlooked  a  damn  sight better than theonce  a  day plate of beans I had beeneating.  Actually, it didn't look bad.No  bugs,  no  discoloration,  no realproblem with the meat actually.  Well,other  than  the section that had beenhit by the bumper.  Good red meat.  Ifyou didn't think about how you got it,it wasn't too bad.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  went back up to the house and got abutcher's  knife.   Flies had begun togather  by  the  time I got back but Ishooed  them  away.  I cut off a chunkfrom the undamaged section and carriedit  back  up to the house.  When I gotto  the  kitchen, I carved off a steakand   wrapped  the  rest.   I  had  norefrigerator  to  keep  it  in  but  Iwrapped  it  in a newspaper and put itin the cupboard.
<P>
That had to be the first meat I had inbetter  than  a  year.  Tasty.  A mitetough  but I figured that was from thecow tensing up before the impact.  Themeat  down  at the grocery store comesfrom  cows  that  are  killed quietly.Those cows never saw what killed them.And  they're  usually  so shot up withtranquilizers,  meat  tenderizers  andstill  so full of growth hormones thatits a wonder they know where they are.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
This  meat  was  gamier.  Sort of likethe cow saw some car heading square atit and tensed up before the impact.  Itried  not  to think about how the cowdied.   I  was  just  thankful for themeat.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I  ate  steak at every opportunity forthe  next  couple of days.  Breakfast,lunch and supper, I ate steak.  I knewthat  beef  was  going to go bad and Iwould  be  back to a diet of beans.  Imight  have tried to stretch the shelflife  of  that beef too much.  Towardsthe  last  of  the cow, I got a littlesick   from   eating   it.    Hurt  mesomething  fierce to have to throw outwhat was left of that meat.I  was back to beans after that.  I'lladmit  that I started walking the sideof   the  Interstate  more  often.   Ifigured  if one cow can get out, maybeanother  one can.  I thought seriouslyabout  walking over to the pasture andopening  the  gate.  You know, sort ofhelp  them  out  onto the road.  But Idecided  against  it.  Cows are prettydumb  animals and I wasn't sure they'dnotice  the gate was open before theirowner closed it.
<P>
About  a month or so after that, I wasup  on  the Interstate.  I hadn't seenanother  cow hit.  Just the occasionaldog  or  cat.  Sometimes a possum or asquirrel.   But  no  cows.   The beanswere  getting  to  me  by then.  I wascussing  my  bad  luck  when  I  saw aGerman  shepherd  that had been killedthe night before.  I thought about howdogs are considered a delicacy in someparts  of the world and how its betterthan beans.
<P>
The  dog  didn't look too bad.  It wasin  worse  shape  than  the cow, beingsmaller  and all.  The meat was prettybadly messed up and bloody as hell butit had to be better than another plateof beans.
<P>
Dog really isn't so bad.  Not the sametaste as beef or pork.  And it sure ashell  doesn't taste like chicken.  Butit  isn't too bad.  It was even gamierthan  the cow.  The meat lasted betterthan  the  beef  had.   Or maybe I wasdeveloping  a  tolerance  for  spoiledmeat.   But  I was ready to go huntingby  the  time  the last of the dog wasgone.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Pretty  soon, I got good at collectingroad  kill.   You  had  to  do it justbefore dawn.  I mean, what with all ofthe  traffic  on the Interstate duringthe day time, it wasn't safe to be outthere  in  the  light.   And  I  was alittle   concerned   about   what  thedrivers  would think.  They're drivingalong   and  they  see  some  old  mancarrying  off a bloody animal and sureas  hell,  I'd  get  a  visit from thepolice.
<P>
And  it  is  bloody work.  Its hard tocarry  what's left of an animal that'sbeen hit by a car and stay clean.  Thecarcass  is usually pretty bloody.  Bythe  time I get back to the house, I'ma   mess.   I  have  to  take  off  mycollecting clothes outside the door.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Now  and  then  I  find an animal thatdidn't  die.   Maybe just a broken legor  dazed  from an impact.  So I carrymy  butcher's knife with me now.  Dogsput up more of a fight; cats go prettyeasy.
<P>
Kind  of  odd.   Ever  since I startedeating road kill, I've noticed changesin  me.   I feel better than I have inyears.    My   eyesight  seems  to  beimproving.   I  know  my  strength  isreturning.   I'm  back to running.  Infact,  if  too  long  a period of timegoes  by  without  new meat, I can rundown  a dog and take him on my own.  Ifigure  its  got  something to do withthe   way   the  animals  die.   Thoseanimals see some Buick bearing down onthem  and  they freeze, terrified.  Inthose  last  few seconds of life, I'llbet  their  adrenaline  level goes skyhigh.   God knows what other chemicalsare   produced   during   their  deaththroes.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I'd  always  thought  that eating meatfrom  those  docile cows, doped out oftheir  mind,  was making us as tame asthey  were.   We  used  to be a fairlyaggressive   nation.    Picked  fightsright  and  left  and won them most ofthe  time.   Then  we  started  eatingdomesticated  meat  and  all  of  thatended.  Well, I seem to be swinging inthe other direction.  Eating road killseems  to  be  having  an effect on mybody.  And my mind.
<P>
I  was  cooking the road kill the sameway  I  would  have  cooked beef.  Oneday,  while  I  was carving up a newlycollected  animal,  I got to wonderinghow  it  would  taste raw.  I tried itand liked it and I've been eating themnatural ever since.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Whatever  those  chemicals are seem tobe  concentrated  in  raw  meat.   I'mchanging  faster  now  since I stoppedcooking  it.   My  hair  is  no longersolid  gray  but  is now streaked withthe original black.  I can run fartherwithout  getting  winded.   I can liftmore  weight and carry it longer.  Butthat isn't what's bothering me.
<P>
Lately, I've been thinking about thosechemicals.   I've  been  wondering  ifmaybe  they  would work better if theywere  from  the same species.  What ifthey were stronger and changed me backto  fifty  or even thirty if they werefrom a human?
<P>
I've   been   waiting   for  an  fatalaccident  to  happen  after  midnight.Maybe some young woman who's returningfrom  a night on the town.  I've heardthat  women have more fat than men andtheir  muscles aren't as developed.  Ifigure I could make it up there and begone   with  the  body  before  anyonearrived on the scene.  It shouldn't betoo hard to carry a woman back here tothe house.  I can lift about a hundredpounds  now  so  I  should  be able tocarry her back with no problem.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
If  I have to, I could help it happen.I  could  rig up a barricade or find away  to puncture the tyres on the car.And  if  the  accident  wasn't  fatal,well, I could help that too.
<P>
What  bothers  me is how quickly I gotto  liking  the taste of uncooked dog.What  if  I  tried raw human flesh andliked  it?   I  could give a whole newmeaning to road kill!
