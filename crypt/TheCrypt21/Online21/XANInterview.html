<P>
      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white>  Firstly  can  I thank you on behalf of<FONT COLOR=green> RIYAN Productions<FONT COLOR=white> for      granting us this interview.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan>  Thanks to you for giving me the opportunity to show and explain      the product.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>  I am sure that the Readers and Amiga Population in the UK and      the  rest  of  the  world will be surprised by your A1.2000.  Can you      tell us a little about yourself, and the company "Vision Design"?<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan>  I approached computers 15 ago, with a Spectrum+2 soon increased      with  a +D interface with 780K drive, creating graphics and adventure      games  with  my  brother.   Later  I  started  my  studies as a cloth      designer  and moved my computer interests to an Amiga 1200 with a 030      accelerator  and  HD, but not for my job, just to experiment it as an      alternative  to  the  PC and not to fall like everybody in an imposed      platform,  but  sadly  my  brother  fell in "the dark side", but this      opened me the opportunity of work for the video-tape industry when my      brother  got  a job as graphic artist in a well known Spanish company<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      and  they  also  needed a Designer for an innovative adventure in the      Myst style, and that was my first job I made with an Amiga (Wordworth      and Pagestream).
<P>
      I  continued  designing games for various companies and at around the      same  time  I  felt disappointed with some computer devices´ designs,      specially  for  drawing,  so  I  started  to develop my own light pen      device  (for  the  Amiga  platform)  and  was  introduced  to  Carlos      Rodriguez, the RCCI ceo, who gave me the opportunity to create Vision      design.
<P>
      Vision Desing was created in 1999 to research for new markets, mainly      we  were  thinking in the alternative computer market, but focused in      efficiency  for  multimedia and ease of use, and of course, the Amiga      was  the  first  and seemed the best solution to sell a computer with      great multimedia capabilities with a cheap cost, but also was evident      that  it  needed an urgent actualization ( more speed, better graphic      capabilities,  easy  access  to  modern  devices,  etc.)  so  I start      thinking  in  create  an  Amiga for the future having in mind how Jay      Miner  (rest  in peace) would like it, in other words, being loyal to      the Amiga style.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white>  You  are  actually part of RCCI a small Spanish PC business,      why then the interest in the Amiga range of computers?<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  Because  the  experience  we  had with the PC equipment we are      selling.   Hard  configurations,  continuous  problems, short benefit      margins, very bad designed architecture, pathetic OS, etc...<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white>  Is  your  A1.2000 ...An Expanded Amiga1200 ...i.e..  Does it      still contain the original motherboard etc.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  Maybe  I'm  disappointing  you,  but  this is only an original      motherboard  with  some  tricks and small boards attached to it.  The      costs   of   building   a   new   board  were  beyond  our  financial      possibilities,  but anyway the standard board leave me the sufficient      space  to  create what I had in mind.  Maybe the only problem was the      ancient  architecture  of  some of the board components, like the IDE      interface or the disk controller.
<P>
      The components that conform the inners of the computer are:
<P>
      - COMMODORE motherboard (last revision)
<P>
      - Fast and buffered IDE interface
<P>
      -  Phase5  PPC  board customised to let a selectable overclocking, to      reach  300mHz  on  the  603 side and 33mHz on the 040 side (of course      with convenient fans)
<P>
      -  Bvision  graphic  board, overclocked by software and cooled with a      big fan that also cools the temperature inside the computer.
<P>
      - Ultraslim 24x CDROM by MITSUMI or CYBERDRIVE with jack output.
<P>
      - and now USB hub, thanks to the new SUBWAY controller.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>   Regarding  the  Above  ...If yes then is the Hardware NEW or      infact Second-hand or Refurbished<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan> Of course all is new.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>   Several  "Companies"  in  the  past  have posted information      regarding  Amiga  compatible  computers, however these have failed to      materialise  ....I  can  see  a lot of people being sceptic regarding      your announcements ....What can you say to convince these people that      the A1.2000 will in fact be available for purchase?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=yellow>      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  I'm  very sorry to say that this will not be really available,      but for various and heavy reasons that everyone will understand:
<P>
      The  first reason is that this is not for starting to sell in January      2002,  but for January 2000.  This never materialised for the reasons      that I will explain in the following points:
<P>
      Firstly I have to explain that this project it's shown now to let all      the  Amiga community know of a secret project that never materialized      but  was  interesting  and  that  some  company  (like Merlancia, for      example)  could  utilize  for a new Amiga model now that they all are      searching  and  publishing  bizarre  designs and towers.  This is the      reason that now you know about this project.
<P>
      Secondly  because of the lack of interest from Amiga Inc.  to license      and  produce  the machine or at least make us a special price for the      1200 motherboards we needed.
<P>
      Also,  the  bankruptcy of Phase5 made impossible to obtain PPC boards      in  that time, the DCE boards, as everybody knows, came after several      months.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Finally  I  have to say that my work for the videogame industry leave      me  with  a  totally  lack  of time to invest in this now, but I also      think  that  this  model is now outdated because the lack of power of      this  design, compared with the actual and near future hardware:  How      a 603 at 300 mHz with a permedia2 will compete with an Athlon at 1700      MHz  with  a  Geforce3, or with a G5 at 2GHz with a Radeon2 and a DVD      writer?  sorry but this doesn't sound like an equalitarian fight.
<P>
      But  if  someone  wants  to  know  if  it  is vapour-ware, I can tell      everybody  that  I  have  2  working prototypes for more than 2 years      until now, with almost no faults.  And the proposal was made to Amiga      Inc..  in December 1999-January 2000, as Fleecy Moss can confirm you.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white>  Your latest time for release is Jan.  2002 ...If so how many      units will you have ready for shipping?<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan>   Like  all  past  questions,  this  one  is  the consequence of      misunderstanding.   The  initial  expected  release  was  going to be      January-February  2000, but pending on the availability of PPC boards      from  Phase5  and  the  amount of mainboards Amiga Inc.  were able to      deliver.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>   The  technical specs.  for the A1.2000 With PPC 603E and 040      even  including  a  17"  monitor (etc.) for the price of 999$ seems a      remarkable  low  price  ...Are you confident that you can produce the      machine at this cost?<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  That  was the point!.  We wanted to compete against the PC and      the  MAC  and that was the only way.  And YES!  we could achieve that      price (although with very short benefits).
<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>  From your Web Site<FONT COLOR=magenta> "We guarantee you that AmigaOS - WORKBENCH      NEVER  has  to  be reinstalled". <FONT COLOR=white> Is this not a rather rash statement      ...I  have used Amiga's for a great many years, but have still had to      reinstall  Workbench  a  couple  of  times.   How  can  you give this      guarantee?<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  Well, I don't know how you utilize your Amiga or what programs      or  patches  you install, but everybody knows that unlike the Windows      systems,  installing  a  Workbench  and  "normal"  programs  (desktop      applications   and   games)  doesn't  destroy  none  of  your  system      components and of course NEVER degrade the OS or the Workbench; and I      have  my  own experience, not having to reinstall the Workbench NEVER      had it not been by a change or crash of a hard disk.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white> Do you have/require a License Agreement with the parent AMIGA      company to release the A1.2000<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan> Yes, this was explained on previous questions.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN: <FONT COLOR=white>  You  state that you are already working on the NG of A1.2000      and hope to include "DVD/CD-Rewriter and USB support".  How viable is      this and will you be writing your own drivers etc.<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN:<FONT COLOR=cyan>  The USB support is now public, at that time was only a project.      The  CD  writer  or  the DVD would use a normal IDE interface and the      common  recording  programs  would recognise and use the unit with no      problems.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>   What  are  your  thoughts  on  the  current  Amiga situation      (AmigaOne/AmigaDE etc.)<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  Good  question.  To say it quickly and not extend too much the      answer,  the  Amiga  One is a total waste of time and money; actually      there  is  not  even  one  reason  to want compatibility with the old      chipset  now  that  everything  is  rather  well emulated, also, this      ridiculous   feature   brings   many  design  problems  and  increase      substantially  the costs.  I would rather concentrate my efforts in a      machine  that would compete for years against the rest of the market,      how?; well, bringing the best of what is available today and building      a board expandible for the future.
<P>
      The  Merlancia  proposals seems more interesting, but have a few weak      points  that  we will see how they will solve, like the transfer rate      of their AGP bus, the lack of drivers for the best graphic boards and      specially  a  ram  bus  that  will  have no memory to attach in a few      months.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  400mhz  board  with  a  G5 socket, UWSCSI or ATA100 IDE, Firewire,      DRAM,  a  DVD  writer  or a CDwriter-DVD combo, and an agreement with      Nvidia  or  ATI  to obtain the source code to program the drivers and      put  one of their cards in an AGP 4x slot, a well finished version of      I-FUSION  or VirtualPC in the bundle as an option, or the passibility      of  buy  only  the motherboard and let the user add the components as      another  option  seems a good start.  Expensive?  sure, but Amiga was      never  cheap,  and  quality  certainly isn't cheap.  And definitively      you'll  agree  with  me  that all amiga fans would buy a monster like      that  and professionals of the video or rendering markets would start      to  turn  their  eyes  and  open  their mouths and remember when they      started all with Amiga, a couple of years ago.
<P>
      I  know  many important people in big companies that were Amiga users      in the past, and ask me frequently how it is going the Amiga.  I tell      them  what  is  happening,  but they are not convinced until they see      good  software  running in a good computer, not promises or emulators      for PC.
<P>
      The  Amiga  DE  is  a  good concept, but has to prove that it will do      something  that others can't do (really interesting things, not board      games) and that we need these things, time will tell.<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
      RIYAN:<FONT COLOR=white>  Do you have a message to our readers (Hope for the future)<FONT COLOR=yellow>
<P>
      XAN: <FONT COLOR=cyan>  I  am  sorry that many people thought this is a fresh product,      but  as you may think again it was really good 2 years ago, but today      it isn't very cool after all.
<P>
      I  wish  the  best  to the Amiga Inc.  team, but the first thing they      should  do  is  to  resolve the Haage & Partner - Ralph Smith battle,      otherwise  both  and  everyone  else who wants to have buyers for his      products will loose much money.
<P>
      For  the rest, we must be close together in those hard times, because      one  day  we will see a bright future very similar to the past.  I am      working  in  new  ideas to achieve this, but I will tell you an other      time, you will see.
