<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This issue, I thought I'd have a look at another
Ripper/Converter/player package.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The one I chose was DBpowerAMP. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This turned out to be a very good choice and has stayed on
my drive ever since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I got the package via a link on the Audio Galaxy site, but
you can get the latest version from <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/">http://<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt'>www.dBpowerAMP.com</span></a><span
style='font-size:24.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The website is very good and includes a guide to using the
aforementioned as well as giving helpful hints and tips to audio ripping. Part
of the DBpowerAMP package is shareware, but I'll leave it up to you to find out
about this part yourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don't let the mention of shareware put you off, the package
is free and the shareware part only extends various options that you can use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right, lets have a look at some of the facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The package comes to roughly 1.4mb so it isn't a gargantuan download.
You can also download codecs for the likes of Monkey and Ogg Vorbis <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and WMA via links from the site as well as
any other part you might feel you need. In total, to try out this package, I downloaded
apprx. 2.5mb of files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The package installs with no problems and after you have
done this, you are ready to explore your new music tool.</p>

</p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the first configuration menus is shown above. The
program is fairly intuitive and can deal with almost anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The player is shown below and again can handle most files
thrown at it. Sound is configurable due to the equaliser and you can load in
different skins to suit yourself. As you can see, I'm fairly staid and this is
the skin I prefer to use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
 <IMG src="Images/image004.jpg" alt="image004.jpg (13804 bytes)" width=362 height=147>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said, sound is configurable,I should have said that
this program has menus for almost any occasion!! I don't particularly like the
way you have to navigate through them and would prefer a simpler interface
similar to WinAmp, however this is a personal preference. For instance , I
would prefer the equaliser onscreen attached to the player all the time! You
can do the usual things with the player like random playing etc. You should see
the "my music collection page", I haven't included a grab of this as I try and
keep the file sizes of the article down somewhat, but rest assured, its very
impressive!!</p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, similar to most other players, you can save
playlists,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>
<IMG src="Images/image008.jpg" alt="image008.jpg (28741 bytes)" width=413 height=340>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and it even comes with a previously played list, if you can't
be bothered to make one up. The program will automatically add every track you
convert to your music collection , which will remember where they are and allow
you to play them without any effort on your part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The player has some very nice touches and is a welcome
addition to anybody's drive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said, this is a package, so you not only get the player
but a ripper/encoder as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ripper part is again fairly straightforward and can be
seen above. CD's titles are collected via CDDB , again a fairly standard
feature of most rippers. In the options part , you can set whether you wish to
let the program automatically retrieve details or not and decide how you wish
your tracks formatted. It even has an option for intelligent formatting which
simply means that it will attempt to keep all tracks looking fairly normal. Of
course, it adds Tags to the files as well.</p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clicking the convert to button will bring up a small menu
allowing you to choose different formats and methods. Downloading different
codecs will allow you to choose from varied formats...as you can see I downloaded
the Ogg Vorbis and Monkey codecs!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mp3 encoding can be done using either Lame or Blade and I
have shown a grab of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the Lame options
menu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The program will also normalise the music for you, very good
if you have a varied list of music with different levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This program is very big in scope and options and you can
configure it for ages to achieve exactly the effect you wish, so it's a very
big help if you read the guide on the webpage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You also get most of this in the helpfiles that come with
DBpowerAMP, and it is a major work in itself just for these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ok, I'll give in here and mention the shareware part. The
shareware part is known as the Powerpack. This is because it adds even more
options to the main program. When I said you can rip audio, you can also do it
via an auxiliary plug in which allows you to use any source such as your record
deck (if you can remember them). You can also have a load of DSP effects to
play with and can script the program to enhance it. It can shut down your
machine after its finished, so you can put on a record and leave it to it.detect
silences etc.loads of things. The Powerpack can be downloaded and used for 30
days without having to pay for it! The price isn't very heavy either, roughly
£10 and is easily registered via the methods laid out in the helpfiles. I
recommend downloading this particular program and if you like it, trying out
the Powerpack as well. The Powerpack also gives the option of ripping to Ram
which helps speed up the process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, you may get the impression I liked this program and
you'd be right. It is very stable on my setup and rips quite happily while
online , so no more skips if your net connection suddenly throws a wobbly! which
BT is prone to .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The player is excellent as is the ripper. As an ex Amiga
owner, I was used to playing with settings to get what I wanted from a program
and this one has so many , its great fun just trying them out. Couple this with
the formats available, the fact that if you buy the Powerpack you get unlimited
updates, and the fact that the authors are planning to include CD burning with
it and various other benefits, you felt that they are falling over themselves
just to please you. The program also has a mailing list as well and excellent
support for requesting features etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have found it excellent value and although not the fastest
(perhaps because I don't use the Powerpack yet), very stable and highly
configurable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You don't want to be having to go online every time you need
a CDDB listing, so why not insert a load of disks into your machine while you
are online? DBpowerAMP remembers the listings and you can let it convert them
another time when your online connection isn't available. As an alternative,
you can convert all the CD's you wish and then go online and the program will
automatically get the listings and rename the files and ID tags to suit without
you reinserting the Cd's. this is the delayed CDDB option. This has so many
nice touches, I won't even attempt to list them all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that's a quick overview. Hopefully, I've gave a (very)
small taste of this program and you'll feel that you need to investigate it
further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Download it and try it out yourself!!!</p>
