     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Two  high  school sweethearts who went out together for four years in
      high school were both virgins; they enjoyed losing their virginity to
      each other in 10th grade.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they graduated, they wanted both to go to the same college, but,
      the  girl  was  accepted  to a college on the East Coast, and the guy
      went  to  a college on the West Coast.  They agreed to be faithful to
      each other and to spend any time they could together.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As  time  went on, the guy would call the girl and she would never be
      home,  and when he wrote, she would take weeks to return the letters.
      Even  when  he  e-mailed  her,  she took days to return his messages.
      Finally,  she  confessed  to  him that she wanted to date around.  He
      didn't  take  this  very  well  and increased his calls, letters, and
      e-mails trying to win back her love.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She  soon became very annoyed with his persistence and now with a new
      boyfriend, she wanted to get him off her back.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,  what she did is this:  she took a Polaroid picture of her giving
      her new boyfriend a blow-job, and sent it to her old boyfriend with a
      note reading, "I found a new boyfriend, leave me alone."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well,  needless to say, this guy was heart broken, but, even more so,
      he  was  pissed.   So, what he did next was awesome.  He wrote on the
      back  of  the  photo the following, "Dear Mum and Dad, having a great
      time  at  college,  please  send  more  money!   I'm  getting  pretty
      desperate!" and mailed the picture to her parents.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Ain't Payback a bitch?</P>


                             <CENTER> Where Do I Come From?</CENTER>
                             <CENTER> ---------------------</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">One day our little niece Rita, went up to her mother and asked, "Mum,
      where did I come from?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My sister in law stammered a bit, but finally got her composure.  She
      thought  it  was  time  her daughter knew the facts of life.  So, she
      told  Rita  how  the  expression of love resulted in the beginning of
      life,  how  life  developed  in  the womb and finally how a child was
      born.   As  my  sister  in  law gave the whole story, Rita's eyes got
      wider and wider.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When she was finished, Rita said "Wow, that's really neat.  That sure
      beats  what  Uncle  Rusty  told  me.   He  said  that  he  came  from
      Pennsylvania."</P>

                               <CENTER> -----------------</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  little  turtle begins to climb a tree slowly.  After long hours of
      effort, he reaches the top, jumps into the air waving his front legs,
      until  he  crashes  heavily  into the ground with a hard knock on his
      shell.   After  recovering  his consciousness, he starts to climb the
      tree again, jumps again, and knocks the ground heavily again.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  little  turtle persisted again and again while a couple of birds
      sitting  at  the  edge  of  a  branch,  watched the turtle with pain.
      Suddenly  the  female  bird says to the male, "Hey dear, I think it's
      time to tell our little turtle he is adopted."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> A  woman  walks  into  her accountant's office and tells him that she
      needs to file her taxes.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  accountant  says,  "Before  we  begin,  I'll  need  to ask a few
      questions."  He  gets her name, address, social security number, etc.
      and then asks, "What is your occupation?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The woman replies, "I'm a whore." The accountant balks and says, "No,
      no, no.  That will never work.  That is much too crass.  Let's try to
      rephrase that."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The woman says, "OK, I'm a prostitute."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "No, that is still too crude.  Try again."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">They  both  think for a minute, then the woman states, "I'm a chicken
      farmer."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The accountant asks, "What does chicken farming have to do with being
      a whore or a prostitute?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Well, I raised over 5,000 cocks last year."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> A mangy looking guy goes into a bar and orders a drink.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The bartender says, "No way, pal.  I don't think you can pay for it."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"You're  right," the guy says, "I don't have any money, but if I show
      you something you haven't seen before will you give me a drink?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "You have a deal my friend," says the bartender.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  guy  reaches  into  his coat pocket and pulls out a hamster.  He
      puts  the hamster on the bar, it runs to the end of the bar, down the
      side of the bar, across the room, up the piano, onto the keyboard and
      starts playing Gerswhin.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "You're  right!  I haven't heard anything like that before," says the
      bartender.  "The hamster is really gifted."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The guy downs the drink and asks the bartender for another.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Will that be cash or another miracle, pal?" asks the bartender.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Watch this," replies the guy.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Again,  he  reaches  into his coat and pulls out a frog.  He puts the
      frog  onto  the  bar,  and  the  frog starts to sing.  The frog has a
      marvellous  voice  and  great pitch.  A fine singer.  A stranger from
      the other end of the bar runs over to the guy and offers him $300 for
      the frog.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "It's  a  deal,"  says the guy.  He takes the three hundred and gives
      the stranger the frog.  The stranger runs out of the bar.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Are  you  nuts?"  asks  the bartender.  "You sold a singing frog for
      $300?  It could have been worth millions.  You must be crazy."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Not so," says the guy.  "The hamster is a ventriloquist."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  the  Spring of 1957 and Bobby goes to pick up his date.  He's a
      pretty hip guy with his own car.  When he goes to the front door, the
      girl's father answers and invites him in.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Carrie's not ready yet, so why don't you have a seat?" he asks.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"That's cool," says Bobby.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Carrie's  father  asks  Bobby  what  they're  planning  to do.  Bobby
      replies  politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or
      a  movie.   Carrie's  father  responds, "Why don't you two go out and
      screw?  I hear all the kids are doing it."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Naturally,  this  comes  as  a  quite a surprise to Bobby, so he asks
      Carrie's  Dad  to  repeat  it.   "Yeah," says Carries father, "Carrie
      really likes to screw, she'll screw all night if we let her!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well,  this  just made Bobby's eyes light up, and immediately revised
      his  plans  for  the  evening.   A  few  minutes  later, Carrie comes
      downstairs  in her little poodle skirt and announces that she's ready
      to  go.   Almost breathless with anticipation, Bobby escorts his date
      out the front door.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> About  20  minutes later, a thoroughly dishevelled Carrie rushes back
      into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father:
      "DAMMIT, DADDY!  THE TWIST!!  IT'S CALLED THE TWIST!!!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A  man  decides  to  take the opportunity, while his wife is away, to
      paint  the  toilet  seat.   The wife comes home sooner than expected,
      sits,  and  gets  the  seat stuck to her rear.  She is understandably
      distraught  about  this  and  asks  her  husband  to drive her to the
      doctor.  She puts on a large overcoat and off they go.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">When  they get to the doctor's, the man lifts his wife's coat to show
      their predicament.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The man asks, "Doctor, have you ever seen anything like this before?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well, yes," the doctor replies, "but not framed like that."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">To My Darling Husband,</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm  sending  you this letter in a bogus software company envelope so
      you'll  be  sure  to  read  it.   Please forgive the deception, but I
      thought  you  should  know  what's  been going on since your computer
      entered our lives two years ago.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  children  are  doing  well.   Tommy  is  7  now and is a bright,
      Handsome  boy.   He  has developed quite an interest in the arts.  He
      drew  a  family  portrait for a school project.  All the figures were
      good but yours was excellent!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  chair  and  back  of your head are very realistic.  You would be
      proud  of  him.   Little Jennifer turned 3 in September.  She looks a
      lot  like  you did at that age.  She is an attractive child and quite
      smart.   She  still remembers that you spent the whole afternoon with
      us  on her birthday.  What a grand day for Jen, despite the fact that
      it was stormy and the electricity was out.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  discovered  that  the  household  chores  are  much easier since I
      realized  that  you  didn't  mind being vacuumed and that the feather
      duster made you sneeze.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  house  is  in  good  shape.   I had the living room painted last
      spring.  I'm not sure if you noticed it.  I asked the painters to cut
      air holes in the drop cloths so you wouldn't be disturbed.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Well  dear, I must be going.  The family is leaving on a ski trip and
      there  is much packing to do.  I've hired a house-keeper to take care
      of  things while we are away.  She'll keep things in order, fill your
      coffee cup and bring your meals to the computer room just the way you
      like it.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  hope  you  and  the computer have a lovely time while we are gone.
      Tommy,  Jen  and I think of you often.  Try to remember us while your
      disks are booting.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Love, Jane</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two  married friends are out drinking one night when one turns to the
      other  and says, "You know, I don't know what else to do.  Whenever I
      go  home  after  we've  been  out drinking, I turn the headlights off
      before  I  get to the driveway.  I shut off the engine and coast into
      the  garage.  I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak
      up  the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom.  I ease into bed and
      my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His  pal  looks  at  him and says, "Well, you're obviously taking the
      wrong approach.  I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up
      the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, slap her on
      the  arse  and  say,  'Come  on  gel, how about a blowjob?' and she's
      always sound asleep."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  American  businessman  was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican
      village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the
      small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  American complemented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and
      asked how long it took to catch them.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Mexican replied, "Only a little while, Senor."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  American  then  asked, "Why didn't you stay out longer and catch
      more fish?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Mexican  said  he  had  enough to support his family's immediate
      needs.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  American  then  asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your
      time?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Mexican  fisherman said, "I sleep late, fish a little, play with
      my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village
      each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos.  I have
      a full and busy life, Senor."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  American  scoffed,  "I am a Harvard MBA and could help you.  You
      should  spend  more  time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger
      boat  with  the  proceeds  from the bigger boat you could buy several
      boats,  eventually  you would have a fleet of fishing boats.  Instead
      of  selling  your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the
      processor,  eventually  opening  your own cannery.  You would control
      the  product,  processing  and distribution.  You would need to leave
      this  small  coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA
      and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Mexican  fisherman  asked,  "But  Senor,  how long will this all
      take?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">To which the American replied, "15-20 years."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "But what then, Senor?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  American laughed and said, "That's the best part.  When the time
      is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the
      public and become very rich, you would make millions."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Millions, Senor?  Then what?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  American  said, "Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal
      fishing  village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with
      your  kids,  take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the
      evenings  where  you  could  sip  wine and play your guitar with your

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  question  continued to surface throughout the years.  Eventually

      such a thing.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  day came, and the ladies filed into the rented bus which whisked

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Myrtle,  after  looking  about,  and  being  amazed  by what she saw,

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Sir," she inquired, "Why doesn't this cow have any horns?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  farmer  cocked  his  head  for a moment, then began in a patient
      tone,  "Well,  ma'am,  cattle  can  do  a powerful lot of damage with
      horns.   Sometimes  we  keep'em  trimmed  down with a hacksaw.  Other
      times  we can fix up the young 'uns by puttin' a couple drops of acid
      where  their  horns  would  grow in, and that stops 'em cold.  Still,
      there  are  some  breeds  of  cattle  that never grow horns.  But the

      of  being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for
      not  forwarding out 50 billion chain letters sent to me by people who
      actually  believe  that  if you send them on, then that poor little 6

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> So  basically,  this message is a big raspberry to all the people out

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you're  going  to  forward  something, at least send me something

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dexter  Bip,  a  13  year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and
      ignored  it.   Later  that  day,  he  was hit by a car and so was his
      boyfriend</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> They  both  died  and  went  to  hell and were cursed to eat adorable
      kittens every day for eternity.  This Could Happen To You Too!!!</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip.  Just send this
      letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay.</P>


     <CENTER> Chain Letter Type 4:</CENTER>
     <CENTER> ********************</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">As  if  you  care,  here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it to all your
      friends.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> FRIENDS:</P>

<CENTER>A friend is someone who is always at your side.</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> A  friend  is someone who likes you even though you stink of dog poo,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> and your breath smells like you've been eating cat food.</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>A friend is someone who likes you even though you're as ugly as a hat</CENTER>
     <CENTER> full of dead rats.</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> A  friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about</CENTER>
      <CENTER>your sad, sad life.</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really think</CENTER>
     <CENTER> you should be thrown to vicious dogs.</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums and then gets the</CENTER>
      <CENTER>check  and  leaves  and doesn't speak much English...no, sorry that's</CENTER>
     <CENTER> the cleaning lady.</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> A  friend is not someone who sends you chain letters because he wants</CENTER>
      <CENTER>his wish of being rich to come true.</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>Now pass this on!  If you don't, you'll never have sex ever again!</CENTER><P>


      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  point being?  If you get some chain letter that's threatening to
      leave  you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it.
      If it's funny, send it on.  Don't piss people off by making them feel
      guilty  about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a
      dead  elephant  for  27  years,  whose only savior is the 5 cents per
      letter  he'll  receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end
      up like Miranda.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Right?</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Now  forward this to everyone that you know otherwise you'll find all
      your knickers missing tomorrow morning.</P>

      been flickering for weeks now."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> He looks at her and says angrily, "Fix the light?  Now?  Does it look
      like I have a NorWeb logo printed on my forehead?  I don't think so."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Well then, could you fix the fridge door?  It won't close right."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">To  which he replied, "Fix the fridge door?  Does it look like I have

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "I'm  not  a  damn  carpenter  and I don't want to fix the steps," he

      working.   As  he  goes  to get a beer, he notices the fridge door is
      fixed.  "Honey, how'd this all get fixed?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She said, "Well, when you left, I sat outside and cried.  Just then a
      nice  young  man asked me what was wrong, and I told him.  He offered
      to  do all the repairs, and all I had to do was either sleep with him
      or bake him a cake."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> He said, "So, what kind of cake did you bake him?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She  replied,  "Hellooooo...   Do  you  see  Jane Asher written on my

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This  guy  was  reading the paper one day lamenting the fact that his
      doctor  has  ordered  him  to  lose 75 pounds.  Next thing he sees an
      advertisement for a guaranteed weight loss program.  He calls them on
      the phone and subscribes to the 3 day, 10 lb.  weight loss program.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  next day there's a knock at his door, and when he answers, there
      stands  before him a voluptuous, athletic 19 year old babe dressed in
      nothing  but a pair of Nikes and a sign hanging around her neck.  She
      introduces  herself  as  a representative of the weight loss company.
      The sign reads, "If you can catch me, you can have me." Well, without
      a  second thought he takes off after her.  A few miles later, huffing
      and  puffing, he finally catches her and has his way with her.  After
      they  are  through,  he  kisses  the girl one last time and thinks to
      himself, I like the way this company does business.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  the  next  two  days,  the same girl shows up and the same thing
      happens each time.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">On  the  fourth day, he weighs himself and, sure enough, he's lost 10
      pounds.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Deciding  that he likes his more slender physique, not to mention the
      method  of  treatment,  he  calls  the company back and subscribes to
      their 5 day, 20 lb.  weight loss program.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  next day there's a knock at his door, and there stands a 22 year
      old  knockout  dressed  in  nothing  but a pair of Reeboks and a sign
      hanging  around her neck, which reads, "If you catch me, you can have
      me."  He's  out the door like a shot.  It takes a while to catch her,
      but when he does, it is worth every cramp and wheeze.  She's the best
      he's ever had.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> For  the  next  four  days, the same girl shows up and the same thing
      happens each time.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">On  the  sixth  day, he weighs himself and, unbelievably, he has lost
      another 20 pounds.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> He  decides  to go for broke and subscribe to the company's 7 day, 50
      pound weight loss program.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Are  you sure, sir?" asks the representative on the phone.  "This is
      our most rigorous program."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Absolutely!",  he  says.  "I love your program.  I haven't felt this
      good in years!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The next day there comes a knock at this door and he enthusiastically
      answers  it.   There  stands Richard Simmons wearing nothing but pink
      racing  spikes and a sign around his neck that reads "If I catch you,
      I can have you."</P>

      these  terrible  bags  under  my  eyes  and the knob won't get rid of

      grabbed  a  tire iron and walked straight up to the gang's leader - a
      huge  ugly guy with a studded leather jacket, bald head but with hair
      all over his body, and a chain running from his nose to his ear.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Undaunted, I ripped the chain out of his nose and ear and smashed him
      over the head with the tire iron.  Then I turned around and, wielding
      my  tire  iron,  yelled  to  the  rest of them, 'You leave this poor,
      innocent  lady  alone!  You're all a bunch of sick, deranged animals!
      Go home before I teach you all a lesson in pain!'"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Impressed,  St.   Peter  says, "Really?  I can't seem to find this in
      your file.  When did this happen?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Oh, about two minutes ago."</P>



                                  <CENTER> Discipline</CENTER>
                                   <CENTER>----------</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  school  teacher  injured  his  back and had to wear a plaster cast
      around  the  upper  part of his body.  It fit under his shirt and was
      not  noticeable at all.  On the first day of the term, still with the
      cast  under  his  shirt,  he  found  himself assigned to the toughest
      students in school.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Walking confidently into the rowdy classroom, he opened the window as
      wide  as  possible  and  then  busied  himself  with  desk work.  The
      classroom  became a bit unruly and he admonished them.  This happened
      several  times.  When he could do work at his desk, the strong breeze
      from  the  window  made his tie flap annoyingly.  He kept rearranging
      and  rearranging the tie as the class raised its level of unruliness.
      Finally,  becoming  disgusted  with  the wayward tie, he stood up and
      took  a  big stapler off his desk and stapled the tie to his chest in
      several places.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Discipline was not a problem from that day forth.</P>

                                     <CENTER>-------</CENTER><P>


      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, there was this penguin driving an old Pontiac through Arizona.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just  as he reached one town, the engine started to hiccup and cough.
      Afraid  of causing more damage, the penguin pulled into a garage, and
      asked the mechanic if he could look at the car.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  mechanic  said  that  he  couldn't  look  at it immediately, but
      pointed  to a nearby diner and said that he'd look at the car as soon
      as possible, and come to find the penguin when he'd finished.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The penguin agreed and went to the diner for lunch.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> The  penguin  was  halfway  through  his  ice cream when the mechanic
      appeared.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Looks like you blew a seal."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">The penguin wiped his beak and stammered, "N-n-n-no!  It's ice cream,
      honest!"</P>



                               <CENTER> Scottish Mystery </CENTER>
                                <CENTER>----------------</CENTER><P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A kilted Scotsman was walking down a country path after finishing off
      a  large  amount  of  whisky at a local pub.  As he wandered down the
      road,  he  felt  quite  sleepy  and  decided  to take a nap, his back
      against a tree.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  he  slept,  two young female French tourists walked down the road
      and  heard the Scotsman snoring loudly.  When they came to the source
      of  it,  one  said, "I've always wondered what a Scotsman wears under
      his kilt."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> So  she  boldly  walked  over  to the sleeper, and raised his kilt to
      investigate.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her  friend  said,  "Well, he's solved a mystery for us!  Let's thank
      him for the education!" Whereupon, she took a pretty blue ribbon from
      her  hair  and  gently tied it around what nature had provided to the
      Scotsman.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Some time later, the Scotsman was awakened by the call of nature.  He
      walked  around  to  the  other  side of the tree, raised his kilt and
      bewilderment  filled  his mind at the sight of the bright blue ribbon
      tied  neatly  in  a  bow.   After several moments passed, he said, "I
      dinna  knae  where  y'been  lad,  but  it's  nice tae see y'won first
      prize!"</P>

      <CENTER>Daddy told me long ago,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> "Son, don't play with your dick.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Your teeth will rot, your nose will grow,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> It's sure to make you sick."</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>"Your palms will get all hairy,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Or so I've heard it said.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> You'll grow up to be a fairy</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Just like your uncle Ned."</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>"Your bones will crack, your skin will crawl</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Your back will always ache.</CENTER>
    <CENTER>  You won't grow more than four feet tall.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Your knees will start to shake."</CENTER><P>

    <CENTER>  "Your tongue will get all mushy,</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Your hair will all turn green,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And then you'll lose your tushy</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Before you turn thirteen."</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>"Your ears will flop, your eyes will cross,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>Your crotch will start to smell.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Your brain will turn to apple sauce.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>You'll die and go to hell."</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> "And if they ask me how you died,</CENTER>
      <CENTER>I'll tell them you were sick.</CENTER>
      <CENTER>But in my heart I'll know I lied.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> It's 'cause you pulled your prick!"</CENTER><P>

      <CENTER>Daddy went to work this morn</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And Mommy's in the kitchen.</CENTER>
     <CENTER> I think I'll get out Daddy's porn</CENTER>
      <CENTER>And give myself a twitchin'.</CENTER><P>

     <CENTER> That's yer lot....Have a very Happy Christmas</CENTER>
     <CENTER> Chris.</CENTER><P>
