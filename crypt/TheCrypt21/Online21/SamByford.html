                              <CENTER>W O A S E Show Report</CENTER>
<P>
      As  one  of  the people having a stand at the WOAse show I thought it      would be nice if I posted a personal report for everyone who couldn't      attend the show to read (and for those that could!!  :)
<P>
      I  was  part of the Mediator Support Group along with my good friends      Sam  Thomas  (Stom)  and  Nick  Darley-Jones (GAG).  Stom is the main      player     and    runs    the    Mediator    Support    Website    at      http://www.amiga-mediator.co.uk/  while  GAG  has a nicely impressive      set-up   and  runs  the  Glochester  Amiga  Group  whos  site  is  at      http://www.glosamigagroup.co.uk/  .   Myself,  I was /hoping/ to have      the 4000 Mediator Logic to go into my 4k bigbox but alas that was not      to be.  Elbox had promised me it would be in my machine by the end of      September/beginning  of  October but at mid-November there's still no      sign  of  it.  I was still pleasantly surprised at how much attention      my  machine got though.  Lots of people were interested in my (Rather      big!)  Zorro  cards  and  the  Mediator 4k Daughterboard that was all      ready to hold all those lovely PCI cards (Voodoo was already in it)
<P>
      Elbox was also supposed to attend WoaSE themselves but for reasons of      their  own they decided not to show up, more fool them!  Everyone who      came  over  to  talk  to  us  said  that  if they had been there with      Mediators  to  sell  they  would have made a killing as I have had at      least  a dozen people say they would have bought mediators/MMcds etc.      Ah well, their loss!
<P>
      But  enough  about  our stand!  :) You want to hear about the rest of      the show!
<P>
      Once  again Eyetech still did not have a working A1 board, but in all      fairness  they did say that things were running being schedule.  They      had the board, looking fairly complete, on their stand along with the      version that was displayed at alt-woa in February.  The Feb board had      only  two  pci  slots,  no  ram slots and several other chips missing      whereas  this new version had all of its pci and ram slots and (to my      untrained  eyes) looked pretty much complete so its a real shame that      they  didn't have a working version to show.  They did, however, have      their  usual  big range of stock to sell and afaik a hell of a lot of      it went before the end of the show!!
<P>
      Most  of  the  other  stands also did a rip-roaring trade but the one      that  caught my eye was a chappie (source unknown!) showing some VCDs      of  the first four episodes of the new Star Trek series:  Enterprise.      He certainly had a flock of people around that monitor all day!!!
<P>
      Several laptops were in attendance showing various Amiga DE stuff and      Fleecy  showed me a few of the GUI's of Elate and explained about how      the  little tiny icons could be configured to do pretty much whatever      you  want - from launching a program to being pure eye-candy by being      "pseudo-intelligent"  and  walking  across  the screen doing a jig or      somesuch!!!  ;<CENTER><H2><I></I></H2></CENTER>

      This  is  pretty  much  the  same  sort  of  thing that Windows XP is      currently  offering  (sorry  to mention those words but I have to say      this  as  I  went  to  PC  World  and  saw XP running) - though XP is      certainly  stabler  and faster than previous incarnations its a nasty      GUI  - massive icons and lots of moving GUI parts that REALLY needs a      lot of horse-power thrown at it!!  - Basically a Child's Toy!!!).
<P>
      If  Amiga  can make this GUI totally configurable so that it does the      same  sort  of thing XP does, but so we can scale the GUI, change it,      and  run  it  on  something  1/50th  the  power XP needs then I'll be      somewhat  happy  and what Fleecy showed me certainly looked as though      it may do all this and more.
<P>
      Mark  Smith (of Kickstart) had leant his Amiga to Pagan Games for the      night  and  it  was  running Earth2140 at an impressively fast speed!      They  also had a handheld PDA along running one of the (impossible to      do)  games  for the DE.  The game consists of loads of coloured balls      that  u  have  to bounce around in a space-type gravity field and get      the  correspondingly  coloured  balls  into  the  corners.   Blooming      impossible!!!!  :-)
<P>
      Kicksoft,  run  by  the infamous Ray Mccarthy pretty much sold-out of      stock  the  same as always and he almost sold me Pagestream but atm I      don't  really  need  it (ok, ok, Ray - I admit came to you asking      about it!!!).
<P>
      SEAL had plenty of people very impressed with their computers running      a networked Heretic II - one fella couldn't believe it was running as      he  "has  a  similar setup and doesn't get anywhere Near that speed".      Go guys!  :)
<P>
      The  games  area  had  a great time too, running Sensi Soccer (which,      naturally  enough,  I  lost 8-0 in ;-) and taking up a lot of peoples      time watching various people thrash each other!
<P>
      The  fella  from  Amiga  Forever  put  on  a demo via his lap-top and      projection  screen  which  had  a  group  of  Miggy users practically      drawling at the improvements in the latest version.
<P>
      And  the  SEAL  publication  Clubbed  had  an official name change to      "Total  Amiga"  which  has been officially endorsed by Amiga and will      soon be going bi-monthly!
<P>
      There  were  of  course plenty of other groups/stands around the show      and  most  of  the  time  you  couldn't move very fast because of the      crowds  but  I just don't have the space to write about them all (and      I'm sure you've read my ranting for long enough as it is!!  :)
<P>
      To  sum  up then - and in my own personal opinion - this was a fairly      poor  show  Hard/software wise but for the atmosphere and for meeting      people  this  was  a  stonker of a show - better in that respect than      previous  shows  I  have been to.  Going back to my thinking it was a      bad  turnout  hard/software wise - this is purely My opinion.  I took      neigh  on  £200  to  spend  and the most expensive thing I bought was      Payback  at £30.  Plenty of people I know didn't take Enough money so      I know that most people were more than satisfied on this front.
<P>
      It  was  lovely  meeting  everyone I speak to over the internet and I      hope  to  see  you  all  at  Son  of  Alt-Woa  in February (when I'll      hopefully have a 4k Mediator Logic in the machine to show everyone!!!      :-)
