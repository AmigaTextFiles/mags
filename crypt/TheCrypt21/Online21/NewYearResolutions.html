<FONT COLOR=cyan>As New year 2002 approaches, it's timefor all you luvverly  people out thereto make some  new  year's resolutions,like not eating so  much chocolate, oronly shagging on  weekends,  so here'smy little  contribution  for  the  newyear, some resolutions  for  the wholescene!
<P>
1)  Kill off the word "Newbie".  We'vehad  this  one  for  far too long now,it's  time  it was done away with onceand  for  all.  From now on, it shouldbe  replaced  by  "Glamer"  (as in:  agames - only computer person) because:
<P>
  A. It's a much better insult  B: It has a definite meaning  C: It does not victimize the     beginners (unless they are     glamers!)
<P>
2) MORE GROUP CO-OPERATION: We want tosee more inter-group co-operation now,because:
<P>
  A: It gets groups in the news  B: It produces better productions  C: We shouldn't be so competitive     all the time, why do we have to     see all the time "sorry (whatever     group) but we did it better".     Its not as if anyone really cares     you know!
<P>
3)  LESS  ELITISM:  From now on, let'sstop judging people by how good at theAmiga  or  PC they are, I gave this uplong   ago,   judge  people  by  theirpersonality,  or  don't  judge them atall!
<P>
4)  MORE  OPENNESS:   A  beginner willalways  be  a beginner unless you helphim/her,   give   some   of  the  lesstalented  a  chance, not knowing aboutthe  Amiga  or  PC  doesn't  make themabsolute idiots you know!
<P>
5)  LESS HURRY:  Does it really matterwho  upgraded  what  first, or who gotthe  first  download of this first, orpurchased  that  first,  the  computerscene  is  supposed to be a hobby, nottake over your life for God's sake!
<P>
And may all your work  in 2002 be wellreceived and well spread, remember:<FONT COLOR=green>
<P>
     <CENTER>BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER!</CENTER>
