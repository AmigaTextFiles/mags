                                    Condom<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  farmer walked into a drug store and said to the pharmacist,  "I      want me one of them thar condoms with pesticides on it.  Where  do      I find 'em?"
<P>
      The pharmacist replied,  "Oh sir,  you must mean that you want the      condoms with SPERMICIDE, not pesticide. They're in aisle 4."
<P>
      "No,   no,   I  want me them thar condoms with PESTICIDE  on  it,"      growled the farmer.
<P>
      "Sir,"  said  the   pharmacist,    exasperated   from  explaining,      "PESTICIDE  is  for killing insects,  SPERMICIDE  is  for  killing      sperm. I'm sure that you mean spermicide instead of pesticide."
<P>
      "Listen here,  " argued the farmer, "I want condoms with PESTICIDE      on it! My wife's got a bug up her ass, and I aim to kill it."

<FONT COLOR=green>                                  The Drunk<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      A  serious  drunk walked into a bar and,  after staring  for  some      time  at the only woman seated at the bar,  he walked over to  her      and kissed her.
<P>
      She  jumped  up and slapped him silly.  He immediately  apologized      and explained,  "I'm sorry.  I thought you were my wife.  You look      exactly like her."
<P>
      "Who would marry you you worthless,  wretched,  no good,  piece of      shit drunk?!" she screamed.
<P>
      "Funny," he muttered, "you even sound like her."
<P>
<FONT COLOR=green>                                  The Hooker<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      One  day,   after striking gold in Alaska,  a lonesome miner  came      down  from  the mountains and walked into a saloon in the  nearest      town.   "I'm lookin' for the meanest toughest and roughest  hooker      in the Yukon," he said to the bartender.
<P>
      "We got her" replied the bartender.  "She's upstairs in the second      room on the right."
<P>
      The  miner  handed  the bartender a gold nugget  to  pay  for  the      hooker  and  two beers.  He grabbed the bottles,  stomped  up  the      stairs,  kicked the door open on the second door on the right  and      yelled,  "I'm looking for the meanest roughest and toughest hooker      in the Yukon."
<P>
      The  woman  inside the room looked at the miner and said,   "Well,      you  found  her." Then she stripped naked,  bent over and  grabbed      her ankles.
<P>
      "How do you know I want that position first?" asked the miner.
<P>
      "I  don't," replied the hooker,  "but I thought you might want  to      open those beers first."<FONT COLOR=green>

                                  The Actor<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
      There  was  once  a great actor who could no longer  remember  his      lines.   After  many  years he finds  a  theatre  where  they  are      prepared to give him a chance to shine again.
<P>
      The director says,  "This is the most important part,  and it  has      only one line.  You walk on to the stage at the opening carrying a      rose.   You  hold the rose to your nose with just one  finger  and      thumb,  sniff the rose deeply and then say the line 'Ah, the sweet      aroma of my mistress.'"
<P>
      The  actor  is  thrilled.  All day long  before  the  play,   he's      practicing his line over and over again.  Finally, the time comes.      The  curtain goes up,  the actor walks onto the stage,   and  with      great  passion  delivers the line,  "Ah,  the sweet  aroma  of  my      mistress."
<P>
      The theatre erupts.  The audience is screaming with laughter,  but      the director is steaming!
<P>
      "You bloody fool!" he cries. "You have ruined me!"
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The actor is bewildered, "What happened, did I forget my line?"
<P>
      "No!" screams the director. "You forgot the rose!"
<P>
