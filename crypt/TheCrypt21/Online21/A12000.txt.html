<FONT COLOR=cyan>      The  A  1.2000 is the result of more than 4 years of continuous work,      first  as  a  dream,  second  as  a personal project and at last as a      company product.
<P>
      It was born to response the user's demands of a reliable, full up and      easy management computer.
<P>
      Based on the original format of the Amiga A1200, but with a brand new      design  and  surprising features like the "EASY OPEN" case, automatic      power-up,   24x  CD-ROM  with  double  audio  output,  fast  SCSI  II      controller,  3D  accelerated  graphics  for  applications,  games and      digital  video,  RISC  processor  at 300mHz, Powerlan ethernet PCMCIA      card  for  local  network or internet through ADSL, 3D glasses output      and a modular system, upgradeable to its next generation.
<P>
      Forget gigantic and monolithic towers with obscene innards that needs      half  a room, and forget to reinstall your operating system every few      weeks.   We  guarantee  you  that  AmigaOS  WORKBENCH NEVER has to be      reinstalled.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Forget  computers  with  fixed  and  limited  screens  and  expensive      peripherals  dominated by a few companies, with the A 1.2000 feel the      power  of  a 17" monitor or whatever you wish to buy and use standard      components with free or public domain drivers.
<P>
      Forget  software at prohibitive prices, You can be legal and original      because  the  Amiga  software  cost a fraction of the prices of other      platform software with the same or better features.
<P>
      <CENTER>In  Vision  we  think  this is the definitive computer, take a closer      look and you will agree.</CENTER>
