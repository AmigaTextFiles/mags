<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>      Three  old  ladies were sitting side by side in their retirement home      reminiscing.   The  first lady recalled shopping at the green grocers      and  demonstrated  with  her  hands,  the  length  and thickness of a      cucumber she could buy for a penny. 
<P>
      The second old lady nodded, adding that onions used to be much bigger      and  cheaper  also,  the  demonstrated the size of two big onions she      could buy for a penny a piece. 
<P>
      The  third old lady remarked, "I can't hear a word you're saying, but      I remember the guy you're talking about."

      1.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   Alien beings from a highly advanced society visit the Earth, and      you  are the first human they encounter.  As a token of intergalactic      friendship,   they   present   you   with   a  small  but  incredibly      sophisticated device that is capable of curing all disease, providing      an  infinite  supply  of clean energy, wiping out hunger and poverty,      and  permanently  eliminating  oppression  and  violence all over the      entire Earth.

(Not on the lips.)<FONT COLOR=white>      C.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   When  he  is  your brother and you are Al Pacino and this is the      only way to let him know that, for business reasons, you have to have      him killed.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>      5.<FONT COLOR=cyan>  You have been seeing a woman for several years.  She's attractive      and  intelligent, and you always enjoy being with her.  One leisurely      Sunday  afternoon, you're watching a football game when suddenly, out      of the clear blue sky, she tells you that she thinks she really loves      you.  She says she's not asking whether you want to get married; only      whether you believe that you have some kind of future together.  What      do you say?<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      A. <FONT COLOR=cyan>  That  you sincerely believe the two of you do have a future, but      you don't want to rush it.<FONT COLOR=white>      B. <FONT COLOR=cyan>  That  you  also have strong feelings for her, but you don't know      when you will be ready for that kind of commitment and you don't want      to hurt her by holding out false hope.<FONT COLOR=white>      C. <FONT COLOR=cyan>  That  you cannot believe the Broncos called a draw play on third      and seventeen.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>      6.<FONT COLOR=cyan>   Okay,  so  you  have decided that you truly love a woman and you      want  to  spend  the rest of your life with her, sharing the joys and      the  sorrows  the world has to offer, come what may.  How do you tell      her?<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
      A.<FONT COLOR=cyan>  You take her to a nice restaurant and tell her after dinner.<FONT COLOR=white>      B.<FONT COLOR=cyan>  You take her for a walk on a moonlit beach, and you say her name,      and  when  she  turns to you, with the sea breeze blowing through her      hair and the stars in her eyes, you tell her.<FONT COLOR=white>      C. <FONT COLOR=cyan> Tell her what?

A real guy      checks  the garbage regularly in case somebody, and we are not naming      names,  but  this would be his wife, is quietly trying to discard his      underwear.
