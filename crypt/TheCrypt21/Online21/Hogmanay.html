"Murdo gave the cock  meal damped withwhisky.  It  stood  on  tiptoe, crowedtwelve times  and  fell  flat  on  itsbeak.
<P>
Later, Murdo, after the fifth verse ofThe Isle of Mull  fell, glass in hand,flat on his back -  doing in six hourswhat the cock had done in two minutes.
<P>
I was there.  And  now  I see the cockcrowing with Murdo's  face and Murdo'swings flapping as down he went.

It was a long way home."                 (Norman MacCaig 1974)<FONT COLOR=cyan>

As you may  well  know,  the season ofgoodwill  is   fast   approaching  us.Personally, I'm not bothered about
<P>
Xmas, its new  year  that this articleis devoted to.   Its  aimed  at people
<P>
that don't know  the  "etiquette" thatwe Scots cycle through every year.  Itcomes in 3 parts;  Hogmanay, New Yearsday and the next few days after that!<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
"Hogmanay in Scotland  is  a  bit likeyour Christmas -  only  without God tospoil things" - Billy Connoly<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
So here's a  quick  guide  to  all youboozers out there on  having a hell ofa new year celebration, from two full-blooded  hairy  highlanders  (well,  aFifer  and  a   Glasweigan,   but  whocares?)
<P>
Hogmanay (meaning "New  Years Eve" forthe ill-informed among you) is usuallyspent by hordes of  people flocking tooff-sales and buying  enough  booze toget an ordinary  person  blitzed for amonth.  However, we Scots  are made ofstronger stuff (Irn-Bru  in our blood,you see)
<P>
Also, people tend  to  "dry-up" ie notdrink anything  prior  to  the  Bells.When  evening  comes,   a   change  ofclothes and  a  bite  to  eat  is  allthat's needed to  prepare yourself forthe forthcoming midnight...  But thereis a lot of  preparation  needed for aHogmanay party, so...<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Plan ahead.  Its no use staring at theclock at 21:30 on  New  Years Eve, andsuddenly  decide  to   have  a  party.Preparation is the  key.   If  you canhelp it, DON'T have  a party yourself.This only means  you've  got  to clearall the mess away  the  next morning -no fun with a hangover!
<P>
If you do  decide  to  throw  a party,make sure you've plenty of drink.  Onething guaranteed to  stop  a  party isthe  beer  running   out.   A  typicalshopping list should include:<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
At least  50  CANS  of  ordinary  beer(whichever  is   cheapest;   people'lldrink whatever's there)
<P>
At least 20 BOTTLES of Newcastle BrownAle or equivalent.
<P>
At least 5 BOTTLES of Vodka.
<P>
At least  8  other  BOTTLES  of  otherSPIRITS.At least 3 BOTTLES of Whisky.
<P>
At least 8 BOTTLES of soft drinks (formixing).
<P>
Clear away all the  breakable goods inthe house, get  rid  of  any  pets andmake sure your neighbours are invited.Its no good having a  party until 5 inthe morning if the old biddy next doorwants to get to sleep at 11!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Invite EVERYONE.   Not  everybody willturn up, but  its  better  to  be safethan  sorry.   Friends,   friends   offriends  and  friends  of  friends  offriends are  all  more  than  welcome.Remember to keep the male:female ratioup  though;  an   all-male  party  canquickly turn violent!
<P>
Don't just plonk all the booze down ona table and let  everyone  get on withit.  It'll be  gone  within  the firsthour  -  instant  "Party  over"  time.Instead,  put  enough   down  to  keepeveryone happy, and  restock the storeat regular intervals.   Remember  - ifthere's no booze, there's no party!
<P>
As the  big  moment,  the  end  of theyear, approaches,  make  sure everyonehas a  drink  in  their  hand  for thetraditional  cheer.   Switch   on  thetelly, ignore all the fiddlers and thetartan-clad  dancers,  and   wait  forit...<FONT COLOR=red>

BONG!  BONG!  BONG!   The  start  of anew year (and goodbye  to an old one).Armed with  a  "dram"  of  Whisky, theREAL celebrations  begin.  People  whowere  waiting  just  for  this  momentproceed to  get  totally  wrecked  andthose who  were  wrecked  already  geteven more wrecked.   Don't worry aboutthis - join in!
<P>
The party will carry on into the smallhours of the new  year.  The only realway to stop it  is  to  remove all thealcohol;   don't   try   this,   it'llprobably end in  a  fight.   Just waitfor it to run  out  naturally and thenfollow  the  people   as  they  leave.They'll more  than  likely  be leavingfor  another  party,   so  don't  hang
<P>
around - follow them.   Fuck the mess,you can do it in the morning.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
If  you  have  any  sense,  you'll  beleaving the hard work  to someone elseand going to a friends party.  This isa much better idea;  no  mess the nextmorning and you  don't  have to supplyas much booze.
<P>
Turn  up  at  the  house  with  a  fewbottles or cans (don't  be stingy - itis Hogmanay and you'll probably end updrinking them yourselves).  As soon asyour in the house,  the MOST IMPORTANTTHING is to find a safe place for yourjacket.  Its no good,  10 hours later,when you're totally  legless and readyto go home, stumbling  about the houselooking  for  that   elusive   bit  ofclothing (and  when  you  do  find it,some kind soul have generously vomitedin the inside  pocket).   So  locate asafe cupboard, bedroom  or  drawer andstick  your  jacket  in  there.  DON'TFORGET WHERE YOU LEFT IT!
<P>
Now, to the serious stuff:<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     <P ALIGN="LEFT">10 LOCATE beer   </P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">20 REPEAT</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">30   DRINK beer </P> 
   <P ALIGN="LEFT">40 UNTIL (drunk) or (midnight) </P>   
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> 50 IF midnight</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">60   CHEER wildly  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> 70 GOTO 20</P> <FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Feel  free  to  replace  the  variable"beer"  with  any  other  intoxicatingliquid of your choice.
<P>
When the  party  starts  to  break up,follow your colleagues.   If  they arejust  going  home,   hard  lines,  butthey'll more than likely be heading toanother  party  where   the  booze  isplentyful.   Follow  them  (but  don'tforget your jacket!)

Back to reality.  Sad  really, as someof us have to  do really tragic things(going back to  England  for instance)and remembering the  fun  times in thefun country.
<P>
Of course, some of us  live in the funcountry...
<P>
  <CENTER> Have a great new year!  Cheers!</CENTER>
