<FONT COLOR=red>                        <H1><CENTER>Here is something to think about</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that we don't have to change friends         if we understand that friends change.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that no matter how good a friend is,         they're going to hurt you every         once in a while and you must forgive         them for that.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that true friendship continues to grow,         even over the longest distance.         Same goes for true love.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that you can do something in an instant         that will give you heartache for life.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that it's taking me a long time         to become the person I want to be.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that you should always leave loved ones         with loving words. It may be the last         time you see them.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that you can keep going         long after you can't.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that we are responsible for what we do,         no matter how we feel.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that either you control your attitude         or it controls you.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>   I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>         that regardless of how hot and         steamy a relationship is at first,         the passion fades and there had         better be something else to take         its place.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that heroes are the people          who do what has to be done          when it needs to be done,          regardless of the consequences.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that money is a lousy way of keeping score.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that my best friend and I can do anything          or nothing and have the best time.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that sometimes the people you expect          to kick you when you're down,          will be the ones to help you get back up.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that sometimes when I'm angry          I have the right to be angry,          but that doesn't give me          the right to be cruel.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that just because someone doesn't love          you the way you want them to doesn't          mean they don't love you with all they have.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
    I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>          that maturity has more to do with          what types of experiences you've had          and what you've learned from them          and less to do with how many          birthdays you've celebrated.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that it isn't always enough to be           forgiven by others. Sometimes you           have to learn to forgive yourself.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that no matter how bad your heart is broken           the world doesn't stop for your grief.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that our background and circumstances           may have influenced who we are,           but we are responsible for who we become.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that just because two people argue,           it doesn't mean they don't love each other           And just because they don't argue,           it doesn't mean they do.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that you shouldn't be so eager to find out a           secret. It could change your life forever.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that two people can look at the exact           same thing and see something totally           different.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=white>     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that your life can be changed in a matter of           hours by people who don't even know you.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that even when you think you have no more           to give, when a friend cries out to you,           you will find the strength to help.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that credentials on the wall           do not make you a decent human being.<FONT COLOR=white>
<P>
     I believe-<FONT COLOR=cyan>           that the people you care about most in life           are taken from you too soon.
