The  American Space Shuttle and Skylabwere   really   just  a  cover  for  adastardly plot.  When Skylab was firstlaunched  it  was  anchored  near to apreviously  undiscovered planet calledMoron.   The  alien  beings who occupythe  planet Moron took their chance toinvade Skylab, and they made prisonersof  the  crew and carried them back toplanet Moron.  They were replaced witha crew of robots, programmed to do thebidding  of  the  aliens.  Thereafter,unknown   to  N.A.S.A.,  whenever  theYanks took some civilized human beingsup to Skylab, they were transported onto planet Moron.  Once there they weresubjected  to  all  kinds  of devilishtorture  designed  to  turn  them intoshivering  wrecks.  They were then putinto giant brainwashing machines which
<P>
sucked  out their brains to be used asfood for the Morons.       
<P>
The  only  metal  which  is  found  onplanet  Moron  is  lead, and they keepgreat  stockpiles  of this.  They fillup  the  empty  heads  of  these  poorunfortunate  creatures  with it.  Theyalso  have  a  stock  of  single braincells    which    they    keep   aliveartificially.  Just one of these cellsis  inserted  into the head of each ofthese  clones.   Now  came  the  finalstage  of  this  fiendish  plan.   Thesingle  brain  cell  was programmed bythe  Morons  before  the  clones  werereturned  to  earth to carry out theirassault on the poor unsuspecting humanpopulation.  Nobody realized they wereclones    because   they   looked   sodifferent from each other, and so theywere  able  to  go  about  their  workunchallenged.<FONT COLOR=cyan>       
<P>
When  they  have reached this state ofreadiness,  their masters take them tothe  edge  of  their planet - which isshaped like a dish, not round like theearth - and push them off.  Because ofthe lead in their heads they fall headfirst  until  they  enter  the Earth'sgravitational  pull, when they usuallyland on their feet.  It doesn't reallymatter  if  they  land on their heads,because  where there is no sense thereis no feeling!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Once   on  the  earth  they  insinuatethemselves  into  all  areas,  usuallyseeking   out   families  with  happy,healthy, well-adjusted children, wherethey  carry  out  the  work  they  areprogrammed to do.  They are programmedto  see evil where there is only good.When   evil   does   exist   they  areprogrammed  to  ignore  it.  They willdisrupt   people's  lives,  cause  allkinds of havoc and misery, tarnish thepure  minds of children, and generallycause  trouble  wherever they go.  Theoriginal  inhabitants  of  the  planetMoron  have  become super- intelligentbeings,  as they have consumed all thebrains  of  their  victims.   The realMorons   are   now   these   brainlesscreatures - called "Social Workers" todisguise their real identity.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
A  couple  of  things  may  puzzle youabout  all  this.   Since every time anew  crew  was  taken  to  Skylab  theprevious  one  was returned to earth -how was it the Yanks didn't notice thedisappearances?  The answer to this isthat  the alien beings on planet Moronhave the ability to synthesize a humanbeing,  and  programme it to behave inevery  way  like a proper human being.These   humanoids   were   the  actualinhabitants  of  each return voyage ofthe  space  shuttle.   They  were alsoturned into brainless morons when theylanded  on  earth,  but  they  had theadditional   ability   to  appear  anddisappear   at  will.   That  is  why,whenever  trouble is in the offing youcan never find a Social Worker!<FONT COLOR=cyan>       
<P>
You  may  also  wonder  how - now thatSkylab is no more - we still appear tobe overrun with Social Workers.  It issimply  that,  as clones they have theability  to  duplicate themselves.  Ifyou  meet a particularly horrid SocialWorker  - "Are there any other kinds?"I  hear you ask - and you think you'veseen them before - you probably have!
<P>
With  the  superior  brain  power theyhave  acquired,  the aliens from Moronhave  designed  a laser gun with whichthey  are  able  to  beam  up to Moronunsuspecting  members  of  the public,and so they are able to carry on theirvile  experiments.   They  usually  dothis  at  night, and they replace eachperson  taken  with  a  clone,  who ispushed  from  the edge of planet Moronand hurtles to Earth.<FONT COLOR=cyan>       
<P>
If  you are the kind of person who hasa happy and satisfying sex life, and agood relationship with your children -which  includes  comforting  them whenthey  are  upset,  and answering theirquestions   about   sex   openly   andhonestly  as  and  when  they  arise -BEWARE!!!    You   are  in  danger  ofbecoming  the  victim  of one of theseMorons.  They are in your midst.  It'snot  Big Brother who is watching you -that  was  in  1984  -  now  it's  thescourge of this modern age, the SocialWorker.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
If you happen to be out late at night,and  see  something  that looks like ahuman  being dropping out of the sky -do  us  all a favour and put it out ofits misery.  Don't worry about causingit  any pain - it can't feel it.  Whatdo  you  shoot  a  Social Worker with?Why,   the  very  appropriately  namedBLUNDERBUSS    of    course!!!    Goodhunting!

<FONT COLOR=cyan><I>This  was  written  a  long time ago -about  a  year  after the time dreadedsocial  workers stole nine children inSouth Ronaldsay, Orkney.  The title ofcourse  derives from the fact that thescandal  in  Orkney  was  likened to awitch  hunt,  and all kinds of sorcerywas  hinted  at.   This article is allfantasy   of  course,  but  the  basicpoints   at  the  end  are  what  thisinvidious   plague   of   social  workinterference  is  all  about.   No oneregulates  what  they  do,  and by thevery wording of a report they can makeit  say  exactly  what they want it tosay.   Every time a child dies becauseof  abuse  they  have /failed/ to see,they  say  "mistakes  were  made", butthey never /learn/ from these mistakes-  they  just  go on breaking up happyfamilies,   looking   for  abuse  that/isn't/  there.   It is time they weresubject to an /independent/ regulatorybody to keep them under control.<FONT COLOR=green></I>
