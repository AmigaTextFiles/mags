      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Dear Mom,</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> We're still in Bethlehem--Mary and I and little Jesus.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  were  lots  of things I couldn't talk  to  you  about  last
      summer.  You wouldn't have believed me then,  but maybe I can tell
      you now. I hope you can understand.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You know,  Mom,  I've always loved Mary. You and dad used to tease
      me about her when she was still a girl.  She and her brothers used
      to play on our street.  Our families got together for supper.  But
      the  hardest day of my life came scarcely a year ago  when  I  was
      twenty and she only fifteen. You remember that day, don't you?</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  trouble  started  after  we were  betrothed  and  signed  the
      marriage agreement at our engagement.  That same spring  Mary  had
      left abruptly to visit her old cousin Elizabeth in Judea.  She was
      gone  three  whole  months.  After she got back,   people  started
      wondering out loud if she were pregnant.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">It  was  cloudy  the day when I finally confronted  her  with  the
      gossip. "Mary," I asked at last, "are you going to have a baby?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Her clear brown eyes met mine. She nodded.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I didn't know what to say. "Who?" I finally stammered.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> Mom,   Mary and I had never acted improperly--even after  we  were
      betrothed.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Mary  looked down.  "Joseph," she said.  "There's  no  way  I  can
      explain.   You couldn't understand.  But I want you to  know  I've
      never cared for anyone but you." She got up,  gently took my hands
      in  hers,   kissed each of them as if it were the  last  time  she
      would ever do that again,  and then turned towards home.  She must
      have been dying inside. I know I was.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The rest of the day I stumbled through my chores.  It's a wonder I
      didn't  hurt  myself in the woodshop.  At first I  was  angry  and
      pounded  out  my frustrations on the doorframe I was  making.   My
      thoughts whirled so fast I could hardly keep my mind on  my  work.
      At  last I decided just to end the marriage contract with a  quiet
      divorce. I loved her too much to make a public scene.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I couldn't talk to you.  Or anyone, for that matter. I went to bed
      early  and  tried to sleep.  Her words came to me over  and  over.
      "I've  never  cared for anyone but you....  I've never  cared  for
      anyone but you...." How I wished I could believe her!</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I don't know when I finally fell asleep.  Mom,  I had a dream from
      God.  An angel of the Lord came to me.  His words pulsated through
      my mind so intensely I can remember them as if it were yesterday.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Joseph,  son of David," he thundered,  "do not fear to take  Mary
      home  as your wife,  because what is conceived in her is from  the
      Holy Spirit."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I couldn't believe my ears,  Mom.  This was the answer!  The angel
      continued,  "She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him
      the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  angel gripped my shoulders with his huge hands.  For  a  long
      moment his gaze pierced deep within me.  Just as he turned to  go,
      I think I saw a smile on his shining face.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  sat  bolt upright in bed.  No sleep after that!  I tossed about
      for a while,  going over the words in my mind.  Then I got up  and
      dressed quietly so I wouldn't wake you.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  must  have  walked for miles beneath the moonless  sky.   Stars
      pricked  the  blackness like a thousand tiny  pinpoints.   A  warm
      breeze blew on my face.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I sang to the Lord,  Mom.  Yes,  me,  singing,  if you can imagine
      that.   I  couldn't contain my joy.  I told Him that I would  take
      Mary and care for her.  I told Him I would watch over her--and the
      child--no matter what anyone said.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I  got back just as the sun kissed the hilltops.  I don't know  if
      you still recall morning,  Mom.  I can see it in my mind's eye  as
      if it were yesterday.  You were feeding the chickens, surprised to
      see me out. Remember?</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Sit  down,"  I said to you.  "I've got to tell you something."  I
      took  your  arm  and helped you find a seat on the  big  rock  out
      back.   "Mom," I said,  "I'm going to bring Mary home as my  wife.
      Can you help make a place for her things?"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  were  silent a long time.  "You do know what they're  saying,
      don't you, son?" you said at last, your eyes glistening.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yes, Mom, I know."</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your  voice  started to rise.  "If your father were  still  alive,
      he'd have some words,  I'll tell you. Going about like that before
      you are married.  Disgracing the family and all.  You...  you  and
      Mary ought to be ashamed of yourselves!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You'd  never  have  believed me if I'd tried  to  explain,   so  I
      didn't.  Unless the angel had spoken to you, you'd have laughed me
      to scorn.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Mom, this is the right thing to do," I said.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And  then  I started talking to you as if I were the head  of  the
      house.  "When she comes I don't want one word to her about it,"  I
      sputtered.   "She's  your daughter-in-law,   you'll  respect  her.
      She'll  need  your  help if she's to bear the  neighbors'  wagging
      tongues!"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I'm sorry,  Mom. You didn't deserve that. You started to get up in
      a huff.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Mom," I murmured,  "I need you." You took my hand and got to your
      feet, but the fire was gone from your eyes.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You can count on me,  Joseph," you told me with a long hug.   And
      you meant it.  I never heard another word. No bride could hope for
      a better mother-in-law than you those next few months.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mom,   after  I  left you I went up the road to Mary's  house  and
      knocked.  Her mother glared at me as she opened the door.  Loudly,
      harshly she called into the house,  "It's Joseph!" almost spitting
      out my name as she said it.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  little Mary came out cringing,  as if she expected me give her
      the back of my hand,  I suppose.  Her eyes were red and puffy.   I
      can just imagine what her parents had said.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We  walked  a few steps from the house.  She looked so  young  and
      afraid.  "Pack your things,  Mary," I told her gently. "I'm taking
      you home to be my wife."</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Joseph!"  She  hugged me as tight as she could.  Mom,   I  didn't
      realize she was so strong.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I told her what I'd been planning.  "We'll go to Rabbi Ben- Ezer's
      house this week and have him perform the ceremony."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  know it was awfully sudden,  Mom,  but I figured the sooner  we
      got married the better it would be for her, and me, and the baby.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> "Mary,  even if our friends don't come,  at least you  and  I  can
      pledge  our love before God." I paused.  "I think my Mom  will  be
      there.  And maybe your friend Rebecca would come if her  dad  will
      let her. How about your parents?"</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I could feel Mary's tiny frame shuddering as she sobbed quietly.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Mary,"  I  said.  I could feel myself speaking more boldly.   "No
      matter what anyone says about you,  I'm proud you're going  to  be
      my  wife.  I'm going to take good care of you.  I've promised  God
      that."</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> She looked up.</P>

     <P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  lowered my voice.  "I had a dream last night,  Mary.  I saw  an
      angel. I know."</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The  anguish which had gripped her face vanished.  She was radiant
      as  we  turned away from the house and began to walk up  the  hill
      together.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just  then her mother ran out into the yard.  "Wait," she  called.
      She  must  have been listening from behind the door.   Tears  were
      streaming down her cheeks.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"I'll  get  your father," she called,  almost giddy with  emotion.
      "We,"  she cried as she gathered up her skirts.  "We," she shouted
      as  she  began to run to find her husband.  "We ...  are going  to
      have a wedding!"</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">That's how it was,  Mom. Thanks for being there for us. I'll write
      again soon.</P>

      <P ALIGN="LEFT">Love, Joseph</P>
