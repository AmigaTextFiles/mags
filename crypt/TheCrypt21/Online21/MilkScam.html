With   all   the   talk  lately  aboutjuvenile crime I would like to recountan  experience  of  mine  as  food forthought  for  all you stupid teenagersout  there that feel like fucking withlaw, like I did!
<P>
In  1974 I was 14, I worked on a milk-round  helping to deliver the milk andcollect  money on Saturday's, in thosedays  a  lot  people  who didn't fancybeing knocked up at 8 am on a Saturdayleft  the  milk  money  in an envelopeinside  the  empty  milk bottles, wellsooner or later I got fed up with thisjob and got a paper-round instead, nowit  just  so  happened  that my paper-round was roughly around the same area
<P>
as  my  old  milk-round so on Saturdaymornings  I  used to beat the milk-manto the envelopes from the milk bottlesand  made  myself a nice few quid eachweek,  but  being a greedy 14 year-oldwith no brain I didn't just nick a fewor  just do it once every few months Inicked  them  all  every week and evenwent  looking  for  other envelopes onother milk-round patches.
<P>
I  should have mentioned before that Igrew  up  in what was then a small-ishcountry  town,  called "Waltham Abbey"in  Essex  and  the crime rate in themdays  was  the  odd drunk and a bit ofshoplifting by an old granny, we had apolice  station  manned  by about fourcoppers,  so  the  milk money scam wasquite  a  big deal at the time (soundspathetic   in  comparison  to  today'sjuvenile  crimes),  would  you believethat  the Police actually staked out asmall block of flats and waited for meto  nick  the  money and caught me redhanded?   It's  all true, unbelievablebut  true,  it gives a good indicationon  how  crime  has  worsened over theyears.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
So  I got nicked, my old man gave me agood hiding (deservedly so!) and I endup   at  Epping  magistrates  Juvenilecourt,  another thing I didn't mentionwas that I had one previous convictionfor  threatening  behaviour  which wasnothing  to  do  with me really, I wasjust  with  some  mates  who  threw  abottle at this bloke who was giving usgrief  for making a racket outside hishouse,  I  got two years probation forjust being there!By  the  time THE GREAT MILK SCAM cameto  court  I  was  15  years old I wasstill  on  probation  for  threateningbehaviour  and  I  had  to be taught alesson!   What  do  think  I got?  Yepthree   fucking  months  in  DetentionCentre.   Let  me  explain a bit here,D.C  was,  as Willy Whitelaw, the Homesecretary  at  the  time,  called "TheShort  Sharp Shock".  It was a Borstalfor  the  under  18's.   I think 14-17year  old's  and  I  fitted  the bill,there  was  one  snag apparently therewere  no  available places at the timeof  conviction  as  D.C's  hadn'
t beenaround long, so get this, they releaseme  into  my  parents  custody until aplace  becomes available, remember I'ma  15  year  old  kid,  I got to go toschool  knowing that I am going insideto   a   nightmare  at  any  time,  nowarning,  I  reckon  it fucked me up abit, but I behaved myself.
<P>
I think it was about three weeks laterI  had  to  go  to  our  4-man  policestation   and   surrender   myself  tocustody and the cunts took me away.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Let's  look  at  this,  I was hardly ahardened   criminal,   alright  I  didshitty things just like any kid, but Ihad  already been punished I reckon bya  good  kicking  from  my old man andthree  weeks  of  shitting  myself andlistening to the rumours of how bad itwas  in  D.C  and  how I would lose myanal  virginity etc.  Well here is thefull  truth  of what really happens inD.C's and probably the reason why theyeventually  scrapped  D.C.  I must saynow  I  have  no reason to bullshit orexaggerate  anything  and this is whathappened,  also  bare in mind that theGovernment   are   contemplating   re-opening  something  similar  to combatthe  juvenile  crime today.  Read thisand  see if you think it would do moredamage than good.
<P>
I  was taken to Kiddlington in Oxford,I   remember   it  was  near  a  smallairfield  (anyone  reading  live  nearthere?).   For the journey there I wasthe  only one in the mini-bus with twocoppers  one  driving  of  course  theother  watching  me  as if I was a madanimal  ready  to  make  a break everytime they stopped at traffic lights, Ididn't  move  a  muscle  for the wholejourney  I  was  so  scared,  when  wearrived  what  seemed  like four hourslater  I  was  taken  to reception andstood  in front of a screw who told metake  off  my clothes I did leaving mypants  on  "Them  as well son" then helooked  me  over,  said he was lookingfor  tattoos and scars which was noteddown  along  with other details, name,age etc.
<P>
He  told  me  my number was "43756" (Ithink!)  and  he  told  me "Never-everforget  that  number  boy!"  (which  Ididn't  for  years  after).   I noddedback  to  him  and  he looked up at mewith  an  evil  look,  you call me andevery  officer  here  "Sir",  which  Iremember  shocked  me for some reason.I  was  given  a  bed  pack,  a set ofworking  clothes  and  uniform  and  atoothbrush  and  comb  "That's all youget,  lose  any  and  you go without".The shoes and boots I was given didn'tquite  fit  me and I was too scared tosay  anything  and  had blisters on myfeet for weeks.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
After  being kitted out I was run (notwalked)  to  a  cell,  I had to pass agiant open dining room which I thoughtmust   be   empty  because  the  wholebuilding   was   deadly  silent  as  Iapproached  I  couldn't  even hear theclank  of  knives  and  forks, but thedining  room  was full of around 50-60people  eating,  with  screws standingand  watching  them, I later found outthe  knives  and  forks were of courseplastic, so not forgetting I was starkbollock  naked carrying my clothes andshit  running  pass  these  people butwhat  was even more surprising I don'tthink  anyone  even  looked up!  I wasbunged  in a cell, but the door wasn'tlocked.   I  was  given  a  list of myrights  and  the ground rules I had toobey,   obviously   I  can't  rememberexactly what it said as it was over 16years  ago,  but  basically  I  had norights  and  do  as your told and keepyour  mouth  shut  and  call  officers"Sir".   After a while a prisoner camein  and  he  seemed  o.k.   he  was anorderly  he
  told  me he was wearing agreen  tie  he pointed out, my tie wasred  (lamer) if you behaved and workedhard I would get a blue tie which gaveyou  extra  privileges such as an hourof  TV  once  a week or a cushy job inthe kitchen etc.  Only the Elite get agreen one (arse lickers/grasses).
<P>
I  asked  the orderly if I could phoneme  mum,  he  laughed  don't be a cuntyour  lucky  if you get a V.O (a "V.O"is  a  visitors order that you send toyour  family/friends  in  order to letthem visit you).
<P>
For  the first two weeks I was in a 12bed  dormitory,  then  in  a  four beddormitory, then for the last two weeksin a single cell on my own.  Don't askthe reasoning behind this.
<P>
To cut a long story short and stop yougetting  bored,  here is a typical dayin Oxford D.C:<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Remember  -  everything,  and  I  meaneverything,  is done in total silence,no  talking  was allowed at all exceptat predefined times or when absolutelynecessary.   The  3  month sentence ishalfed when you go in to six weeks andtime is added on for bad behaviour.
<P>
         GETTING UP 7.00 A.M.
<P>
Woken  up  (you  get up immediately, Inever   saw   what   happened  if  youdidn't).
<P>
Make  your  bed  pack, you had to foldyour  sheets  and blanket in a precisefashion   at  the  end  of  your  bed,presumably so they can see you haven'tstolen  one to use in an escape!  Thisritual  was  fanatically upheld, therewere  even classes held to show peoplehow  to fold them properly, you had togo  to  these  classes  if  your  packwasn't  perfect  and  I  mean  fuckingperfect, all to do with discipline!
<P>
After   making   your  bed  pack,  getdressed  in  working  gear,  overalls,boots and gaiters.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Then  into  the  washing  area, if youneeded  to shave (one or two did), youwere  issued  with a razor and watchedby   a  screw  until  finished,  Bic'sweren't  about  in  them  days and thescrews didn't want anyone getting holdof razor blades.
<P>
To  clean  your  teeth you were issuedtoothpowder,   not   paste,   it   wasbasically  smokers  powder which afterweeks  of  use  took off the enamel ofyour teeth, bastards.
<P>
               7.30 A.M<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Into  the giant open dining room, pickup  a  plastic  tray  which  had  fourcompartments in it where your food wasslapped,    typical    breakfast   wasPorridge,   1  sausage,  2  slices  oftoast, cup of tea (no sugar available)One  thing  I  noticed,  I  didn't eatanything  for  the  first  day, partlybecause  it tasted so crap and partly,I   suppose,   because   I  was  stillshitting myself and of course the cons(fellow  prisoners) on my table lappedup mine, secretly of course.
<P>
On  the  wall was a large pad of paperand  on  it was a large capital letterit  was a T, at the time I didn't knowwhat it was so I ignored it.
<P>
               8.00 A.M<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Into  the  courtyard,  where  we  werecounted  and allocated places of work,on  my  first  day  I  was left in thecourtyard  with  about ten other cons,we  had all arrived that week I assumeand  get  this,  we had drill training(marching,  like  in  the  army) Left,right,  left,  right right wheel, leftwheel,  quick march, double march etc.This  was  because  everywhere we wentoutside  the building you had to marchin   an   orderly   and   professionalfashion,  there was also extra classesthat you had to take if you were crap.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
On  later  days  I  was  sent  to  theworkshop, where you had to push rubberon  to  strips  of  metal  for curtainrails  it  was  fucking  painful  yourhands  were red raw after a few hours,but  there  was one bonus that made itall  worth  it,  the only place in thecamp  that  had  a radio and it was oncontinuously and as nobody was allowedto  talk  you  could  hear it, I stillremember  hearing  Music  was my firstlove  by  John  Miles on the radio andwhenever I hear that it always remindsme of that shit-hole workshop.  I alsoworked  on  the  gardens,  digging bigholes for no apparent reason and laterdoing  floor cleaning, I never did geta cushy job.             12.30 LUNCH
<P>
I  honestly  can't remember much aboutthe  food, except that the one thing Ireally  liked  was  what  they  called"Duff  pudding"  I  would have fuckingkilled   for   it,  one  day  when  wehappened  to have Duff, a screw calledout  "Seconds".   I was up like a shotto  get some, the problem was I hadn'tfinished    mine    and    the   threecompartments  on my tray had been fullof  things  like  gravy  and shit likethat  so on my way to the hatch I tookone  massive mouth full of duff it wasso  big  I  could  hardly  fit  it in,anyway  a  screw  saw  me a whacked meround  the  head so hard I nearly spatthe  lot out, "You fucking Animal, Getback to your table!".<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
So  I  had  my first run in and missedout  on  the  extra Duff.  A con who Igot  on  with  quite  well on my tablethen  whispered  to me "It wasn't yourturn  you stupid cunt!" and he flickedhis  eyes  over to the pad on the wallthat had the letter 'W' on it, then hewhispered  "It's  the  first letter ofyour  surname,  your's  is 'B', that'swhen  you  can  get  seconds".  If thescrew  had realised I had tried to conthe  seconds  queue  fuck  knows  whatwould of happened.
<P>
              1.00 P.M.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
This  was  the first chance to talk toanyone  for 10-15 minutes, just have ageneral  chat etc., this is when I hadthe  old  smoking  pangs  the most Theonly  drag  of a fag I ever had in thesix  weeks  I was there was a from thebutt  of a fag a screw dropped outsideand didn't tread on it.
<P>
             1.15 APPROX
<P>
The older cons (16 and over) went backto  work  and  the lamers - under 16 -went  to school, which was basically awooden  hut  with  an outside teacher,sometimes  a  women.  It was excellentand  just  like  real school you couldfuck  about,  talk  and  not  learn  athing,  although  you  could only fuckabout so much of course because if theteacher reported your behaviour to thescrews the diarrhoea hit the fan, alsoyour   school   work  was  taken  intoconsideration  on weather your tie waspromoted.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
            4.00 (I THINK)
<P>
P.E.   Nasty, your P.E.  kit had to befolded   perfectly  in  your  personalshelf  that had your number on it, youwouldn't believe the fuss if it wasn'tperfect!    P.E.   was  enjoyable  butbloody  hard,  circuit  training, longdistance  running  (round  a  footballpitch),  gym  exercises  like push upsetc.   and  the instructor making sureeveryone  was pushed to the limit, hisfavourite  catchphrase  I remember was"You  fucking great Jellybabys".  P.E.was  also  a  place  where  if you didreally   well   you   could  earn  tiepromotion.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
               5.30 TEA
<P>
Was  identical  to  lunch,  except youwere totally knackered.
<P>
              6.00 P.M.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  three  hours  between 6 and 9 wasspent  in classes of some sort, if youwere   crap   at  making  bedpacks  ormarching  or whatever you had to go ona  special  class  for  lamers, if youwere  free  you  could  choose  from arange   of   classes   such   a  motormechanics, cookery, English etc.It  all sounded good but was extremelycrap,   it   was  all  theory  and  nopractice,  most  people  tried cookeryclasses thinking they would be able toget  hold  of  some  food,  no fuckingchance  you  were  in a classroom withbooks,  unbelievable, it was basicallyto give us all something to do, with aminimum   amount  of  pleasure  gainedpossible.
<P>
Between  7  and 8pm the blue and greenties   got   special  privileges  likewatching  TV  and  playing  chess  andcards.   Hmm,  I have to admit I nevergot any promotion of any sort.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
              9.00 P.M.
<P>
At  last a quick shower and bed.  Thisis where I devised a system of my own,now  I  was (and still am) a bit of anintrovert/shy,  the  toilets  in  thisjoint were bloody awful, if you wanteda  crap  you had to sit there in frontof  everyone  as  the  cubicles had nodoors  on  (to  stop people wanking inthere  I  was told) and during the dayif  you  wanted  to  go for a slash orwhatever  you  had  to call out "Can Ifall  out Please Sir" which in Englishmeant  can  I got to the bog mate!  Ifhe was in a good mood he would say yesand  take you to the bogs and stand atthe doorway and inevitably there wouldbe others there as well, not so bad ifyou just want to piss but I was fuckedif  I was going to sit there strainingand  taking  a dump in front of two orthree  people  oh  for  a bit of humandignity!  I realised to get a peacefuldump you waited until bedtime and wheneverything was settled down and ask tofall out then!<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
In the dorm's you have a screw sittingin  a comfy armchair at the end of thedorm  all  night keeping an eye on us,he  is the one you ask if you can fallout,  so I did that and 8 times out often  he  would  let you go on your ownand  you  could  fart  and  strain andenjoy  all  the pleasures of a qualitydumping  session  in  relative  peace,although you had a time limit as afterabout  five minutes he would check youout.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Other  things  that spring to mind wasthat  I  was  always hungry, you nevergot  enough to eat.  There was not oneact of violence in the whole six weeksI was there apart from screws slappingyou on the head or a quick kick in thearse, there was little opportunity forcons to talk together yet alone fight,and my anus remained fully intact (andstill is, thank you lord),<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
I could go on for at least another 100pages  but I think you get the generalgist   of  how  life  was  in  D.C  onreflection I had a lucky time not muchtrouble  and I got out in 6 weeks withno  time  penalties.  One thing I mustsay  though  is it worked on me, therewas no fucking way I wanted to go backin  that  shit  hole  or  any like it,apparently  I  was  in  a  soft one, aplace  called  "Send"  was the worst Iwas  told.  I kept out of trouble thenuntil I was about 19.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
What  do  you think this military typetraining  would  do  to  the kids now?Would it work?  I think it might help,there is a lot to be said for good oldfashioned  discipline  and there is nochance of cons learning "tricks of thetrade"  from  other cons as you barelyget  the  chance  to  talk  to anyone.Short Sharp Shock anyone?
<P>
If you did a D.C why not write in withwhat  happened  to you?  Especially ifyou did it at Oxford!End.
