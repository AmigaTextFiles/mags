<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  sadly ironic how it takes horrific events to place  things
into perspective,  but it has.  The lessons learned this week, the
things  we  have  taken for granted,  the things  that  have  been
forgotten or overlooked, hopefully will never be forgotten again.</P>
