      Foreword:
<P>
      In  this  section  of  the  Crypt,  it  is  my  intention  to provide      informative  text  and  illustrations  for  all  that are interested.      Thanks  go  to  Ray  for  encouraging me to consider the venture, and      Chris Skelhorn, who started the ball rolling with a question from his      childhood!  Not of course forgetting the Staff Team, without whom the      whole  magazine  would  not  be  possible, and the help, pictures and      information  provided  by  Watercress Line, and Simon Smalley.  While      all  attempts  to  ensure  information  is  correct will be made, the      methods  of  research cannot be guaranteed, in which case, my profuse      apologies.  Now please enjoy what I have to offer you.
<P>
      We  start  with  a  brief  account  of  how  railways grew from their      original construction, through to the system we know now.
<P>
      Canals were the original method of heavy transport, but had the major      disadvantage  of being fixed in their routes, making transport to the      newly  founded  industrial  towns  awkward.  This is because roads at      this  time were still reliant upon horse traction, and not well made.      Traction  engines  were  still  in  their  infancy,  hence  slow  and      unreliable, making road transport rather expensive.
<P>
      Rainhill Trials
<P>
      After  the  advancements  of  James  Watt with the stationary engine,      various  entrepreneurs  sought  to  harness the power of steam with a      self-propelled  unit, giving rise to a variety of weird and wonderful      designs   along  with  a  host  of  exhilarating  claims  from  their      designers, taking the lead from Trevithick.  This indeed was a golden      time  for  engineers,  and  they came from the most unlikely of back-      grounds,  along  with  a  challenge  of  proficiency  to  be sited at      Rainhill.   Not  all  designs  met  with  the same amount of success,      however.   Mechanical  failures  and  the occasional boiler explosion      took  their  toll  of  the  competitors.   The outright winner of the      contest  was given license to design and produce the motive power for      the  first  steam  hauled  railway  in the north, a fine prize in any      consideration!
<P>
      We  must  bear  in  mind that scepticism was quite rife at this time,      along  with  the consideration that "one would suffocate at speeds in      excess  of  12  miles  an  hour"!  Until this time, railways had been      either  horse-drawn  or  stationary engine powered, with a few supply      lines  gravity  operated,  the  loaded  wagons descending raising the      empties  by  means of rope and pulley ( not well known for safety, as      speed was difficult to control).
<P>
      It  may  be noted that footplate men had no real training for the job      at  this  time,  rather it was a case of trial and error.  Those with      enough bravado to become footplate men enjoyed a sizeable income, and      something  akin to star status, not without a certain amount of risk,      however!

      The Stephensons
<P>
      After  the  success of "Rocket", the man later to be known as "father      of  the  railways"  went  from  strength to strength.  Townships were      growing  at  an  ever-increasing pace, and along with them a need for      larger  consignments  of goods and food.  The railways were a natural      choice  for  rapid  transport of these commodities, and new companies      sprang  up  everywhere.   Affluent business men saw an opportunity to      prosper  from the railway constructions, and Mr.  Stephenson was at a      height of popularity!  He wasn't the only one, though.  Daniel Gooch,      Isambard  K.   Brunell,  and  a host of other engineers arose, giving      rise  to  some  of the greatest engineering feats ever witnessed.  As      time passed, Stephenson's son rode to similar fame on the strength of      his father's reputation, albeit with an occasional guiding hand.       The replica of the 'Rocket', which, though not the original, has been      constructed  from Geor
ge Stephenson's original plans, and operates at      100 pounds per square inch boiler pressure.  Notable features are the      large  diameter  long  stoke  pistons,  a clear visible sign of a low      pressure boiler being employed.

      Construction and Usage
<P>
      At the time of construction of the railways, the British canal system      was  already  virtually  complete,  which meant that there was a rich      supply  of  navigation workers, known later as "navvies".  These were      the  un-sung  heroes  of the day, for though not best known for their      gentleness, would put most "hard working" men to shame, and regularly      produced results in record time, with the simplest tools and the most      harsh  of  working conditions.  Frequently working away from home was      the normal for these men, and dying on site was thought nothing of.
<P>
      The  "Steam-Navvy", when introduced, eased the workload of these men,      and  must  have  been  a  welcome  sight  for  all.  These excavation      machines  meant  that  earthworks  could  proceed  far  quicker  than      previously,  giving  the  contractors  a  better chance of completing      contracts  within  an  acceptable  time scale.  Unfortunately for the      navvies,  tunnel  boring was still a man against nature affair, and a      risky task too.
<P>
      The  course  of  each  line had of course to be surveyed, not an easy      task  in itself!  The prior consideration was to reduce the import of      materials  to  a  minimum,  using  spoil from cuttings and tunnels to      build  embankments.  Small parties of men would set out, and mark the      route  with  small  flags  or staves, the navvies working behind them      after permission had been granted to build.
<P>
      This  plan of action worked well here, but not always abroad.  In one      instance,  the  nature  of  the  country's  climate  gave rise to the      marking  staves  rooting; by the time the navvies got to them, it was      impossible to distinguish between staves and natural growth!
<P>
      Britain had become highly sought after for it's engineering skills by      European  countries,  and  held  in high esteem for it's knowledge of      railway  building.   The  evidence of this may still be found abroad,      though  mostly  in museums now.  Locomotive and rolling stock designs      had  also  advanced  significantly,  with faster and more comfortable      services  being  offered.  Smaller companies owning important linking      lines were being absorbed into what was to become the "big four", and      the gauge wars had started.      Four Feet Eight, etc.
<P>
      It  had  become  evident  after  a  while that trackwork of differing      gauges  was  the major cause of inconvenience to passengers and staff      alike;  a  great  deal  of  train swapping would be involved when one      encountered another company utilising a differing gauge.  It had been      known  for a debate on the subject to descend to a near fist fight on      several  occasions; at the end of the day, the transport executive of      the  time  selected  the  now  standard four feet, eight and one half      inches as the only acceptable standard, not to the likings of the now      Great Western Railway who had fervently favoured the broad gauge.
<P>

<P>
      This, of course, enabled the traveller to remain in one train for the      total  journey,  making  rail  travel  a  far more convenient mode of      transport,  and much like the system we have now.  With this liaison,      an  extremely  competitive situation arose who could provide the most      comfortable  /  fast  / inexpensive service for passenger and freight      services.  This competition, however, spelt disaster for a great deal      of  the  remaining smaller companies, who simply disappeared into the      'big four' melting pot at the turn of the century.

      War and the Railways
<P>
      There  was  one thing certain by the end of the 1800's - the railways      were  here  to  stay,  and  war was another medium which proved their      worth.   By  this  means,  all manner of armament, supplies, cavalry,      etc.  could be conveyed quickly and easily.  This was a fact that the      military had realised quickly, and utilised to the full; particularly      on the battle fields, where other attempts simply 'bogged down'.  The      military,  however, had little knowledge of railway construction, and      the navvies had even less knowledge of the military !  This in itself      must  have  given  rise  to  problems  as the navvies only took their      orders from their own gaffers!
<P>
      Peacetime Again
<P>
      After  W.W.1, the railways settled down to their previous competitive      status,  having  played  a  crucial part in the war effort.  This was      another golden age for rail transport, with the now familiar names of      Gresley,  Stannier, Collett, Fowler, et.  al.  beginning to appear on      the  scene.  Indeed, as these men matured in status, there was raised      a  question about performance and efficiency, which eventually led to      the  "locomotive  exchange  trials",  and a contrivance to obtain the      absolute  best  from the locomotive designs of the day.  This went as      far as to fitting streamlined casings to express loco's, which caught      the  attention  of the populace, by now looking for improved services      over  distances.   These  trials proved to be most educational, in so      far  that  some  locos  were  discovered to dislike anything but best      Welsh   coal,  whereas  others  still  put  in  a  reasonable  effort      regardless;  the  
streamlining of locos however failed to produce any      major  benefits.   If  anything,  the  additional bodywork slowed the      loco,  and made routine maintenance a troublesome chore.  The Gresley      A4's had little to lose, such was the nature of construction.

<P>
      Sir Nigel Gresley ( L.N.E.R.) produced some outstanding machines, the      most memorable being the A4 class with their aerodynamic casings, and      unusual liveries.  There were, of course, some less favoured designs,      including  the  B17, a 4-6-0 which resembled a cut down A4, but which      proved  to be a rough ride, and required a highly skilled crew to get      the best out of them.      Sir William Stannier ( L.M.S) also produced memorable machines in the      forms  of  the  Princess  and Duchess class express locos, the latter      originally  sporting  a  streamlined  casing.   These  were extremely      powerful  pacifics, designed to haul heavy expresses over Shap Summit      without the assistance of bankers, and did exactly that.  Thankfully,      both  types of loco have been preserved.  Also of note is that he was      a  protege  of  the  G.W.R.,  evidence of which can be found in these      designs.
<P>
      Bullied  ( S.R.) produced the strangest looking and lightest pacifics      of  all.  The overall design was radically different to anything else      on  the  British  network,  but  proved  to be too time consuming and      costly   to   maintain   without  modification  to  a  more  standard      arrangement.  The fact that these machines were ever built is another      story.
<P>
      Churchward  and Collett ( G.W.R.) produced some of the most aesthetic      locomotives  to  be found on the British Railway network.  The G.W.R.      held  on  to  it's  green livery for motive power virtually from it's      conception,  and,  when  trimmed  with  polished  copper  and  brass,      resulted in the most pleasant sight.  The last steam locomotive to be      constructed  at  Swindon  Works was 92220, 'Evening Star', which bore      all  of  these  hallmarks,  and  became unique in her own right, even      though a Riddles standard design.

                                        6         Signalling
<P>
      Of  necessity,  signalling  had to be deployed, and the upper / lower      quadrant  signal  system developed rapidly from the earlier patterns.      These were rod activated from a local signal-box along with points in      the  vicinity, making the signal-man's job quite an exertive one.  In      addition, each signal box was connected by telegraphy, with a code of      bell-rings  to  announce  train and line status.  Each of these areas      were known as 'blocks', hence the system known as the 'block system'.      In light of a series of mis-haps, signals were eventually interlocked      with  the  points,  eliminating  errors  from  signalmen to a greater      degree.   The  dictates  of  the block system were simple - until the      next block was clear, no train was allowed into it.
<P>
      Single  line  working  with  passing loops at stations were generally      operated  by  the  'token'  system,  whereby the footplate crew would      collect a token from a signal- man before being allowed into the next      block.   This  would  then be passed to the next signal-man ready for      the  next  train,  creating  a  virtually  infallible safety check on      traffic.
<P>
      Today,  colour  light signalling is the common method employed, using      track  cicuitry  for  indication  of a train's position.  This, along      with  the relatively low weight of modern rolling stock, lends itself      to  leaves on the line causing havoc with the computerised system, as      a  heavy  fall of leaves creates an insulator.  Not all technology is      for the better!      That's  all  for now, I hope I've wet your appetites for the features      to follow; Accounts of real life experiences, stories of railmen past      and present, technical information, and lots more - bye for now!
