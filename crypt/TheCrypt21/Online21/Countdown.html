<FONT COLOR=cyan>The  lift descended down the mineshaftloudly.   The  grating  of  metal uponmetal  was audible and the progressionwas  slow.   Leroy  looked down at hiswatch,  squinting  one eye to make outthe  time  in  the  dim light; "Twentypast  eight"  he  murmured to himself.He noticed that he was murmuring a lotmore  than  he  used to- still, it waskind  of  comforting  down in the minewhen  you had no-one to talk to exceptEric      Hudson.       He     grinnedunconsciously.
<P>
The  lift squealed and shook violentlyas  it transferred itself from the oldstructure  of  the  shaft  to the new.Then, after a second or two it resumed
<P>
its  original  grating as it descendedthe extension.
<P>
Leroy  enjoyed  his job; in this tradeyou  had  to  or  you"d  go  mad.  Theseclusion from humanity during the daymade  him appreciate life more betweenshifts-  or  so  he  said.   He  was aconformist;  a  member of the NationalUnion  of  Mineworkers not for his ownpersonal benefit, but because everyoneelse was.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  lift  lurched to one side causingits  occupant  to momentarily lose hisbalance.
<P>
Leroy  adored  routines; long, loopingroutines.   Wake  up.  Eat.  Dig coal.Eat.   Dig  more  coal.   Eat.  Sleep.That  was  one  of his favourites.  Atthe  tender age of eighteen, Leroy hadbeen  taken  on  as an assistant drilloperator    and   promised   fantastic"career   development  opportunities".Now,  sixteen years on, he was leadingsupervisor    of    group   6C.    Theprogression  had  been  very  slow andpainful,  but  now  he supposed it hadall  been worth it.  He had never eventhought  about  retirement; compulsoryresignation  (or  redundancy as it wasmore  commonly  known) was the thoughton most miner's minds.  The demand forcoal  had  been on a constant decreasesince  the  early eighties and now thesituation   was   becoming  desperate.However, when the -
<P>
The   lift   crunched   to   a   halt,exhausted.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Leroy  stepped out and glanced up at asign   which   read,  "Sub-Level  six.Please  ensure  that all hard-hats andheadlamps   are   fitted  and  workingcorrectly."
<P>
He  instinctively reached for the backof his hard-hat and flicked the switchto  "on".  Immediately a powerful beamof  light  shone down at the ground infront of him.  He started off down thetunnel.   It  was  lit  up  every  fewmetres  or  so  by a safety bulb (safebecause  no  sparks  were created fromthem).    Unfortunately   though,  thelight  they  gave  out was minimal andthey   were   always   having   to  bereplaced.   His  heavy  black  leatherboots  dispersed large clouds of blackdust around him when he walked.
<P>
As  he  veered to the left, the tunnelsuddenly  became  narrow  and he couldhear  voices.   He  ducked his head tonarrowly   avoid   a  dangerously  lowsupport   beam   and  continued,  halfwalking,  half  crawling,  deeper intothe tunnel.
<P>
"Hey  Leroy!"  He  looked  up.  It wasJake.  He was studying some plans.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Morning   Jake!"   he   replied.   Henoticed Ricky and Hudson fiddling witha  drill  engine  at  the  end  of thetunnel.
<P>
"What"s  wrong  with Terence?" Terencewas  the  "friendly drill".  "Terence?Don't  talk  to me about that piece ofjunk.   He's  more  trouble  than he'sworth."  Jake  looked  annoyed, "Oh, Idunno,  something's  jammed  the  damnmotor."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I  see,  so what's our next move?  Wehaven't got long if we want to stay onschedule."Jake smiled, "I don"t know sir, you'rethe  chief supervisor." He enjoyed theoccasional joke about Leroy's positionof  authority,  or  rather his lack ofability  to  use  it.  On paper, Leroywas   in   charge  and  there  was  nodisputing  that; but down in the mine,there  was a kind of friendly alliancein which everyone was as equal as eachother.  It had always worked that way.Jake  stared  at the ground and rubbedhis  temple  in search of an idea.  Helooked   up,  "We  could  always  takeTerence  back  up  to  the maintenancecentre and get him fixed."
<P>
"What   -   are   you  crazy?!"  Leroyspluttered,  "And  have Stevens on ourback  for the rest of the week tellingus  how  we  should  be  looking aftercompany equipment!  No way man." Leroyand  Stevens  hated  each other.  Morethan   that,   it   had  mutated  intosomething   much  more  grotesque  andcomplex    than   hate.    They   wereintimidated  by  each  other  and in away,  respected  each  other  to  someextent.   But  Leroy  was  a threat toStevens" career and similarly, Stevenspossessed  the  power and authority toruin his life.  Leroy's heart missed abeat  whenever  the word "Stevens" wasmentioned.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Ah shit, I'm sorry man.  I'm sorry."
<P>
"It's  ok  Leroy,  everything's cool."Jake turned back to his plans.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
It  was  a  quarter  of  nine when thesounds  started.   Ricky was the firstto notice them.
<P>
"Lee,   did   you   hear   that?"  Theabruptness in his voice startled him.
<P>
"What?"  Leroy  hated  it  when peoplecalled him 'Lee'".
<P>
"There - there it is again!"
<P>
"What the hell are you talking about?"He  listened  hard  but heard nothing;either  Ricky  was  kidding them or hewas  losing  his  hearing.   He  hopedRicky was kidding them.
<P>
"Listen!"  There  was  silence.  Rickyflicked  sharp  glances  between them.Empty  seconds  passed...   Hudson wasthe  first  to speak, "There"s nothingthere!  There's no sound ok?  I - "
<P>
"Shut  up  man, I can hear something."It was Jake.
<P>
"I told you, there"s nothing t - "
<P>
"I  said  shut up, I can hear it can'tyou  hear  it?"  Jake  was frowning indeep   concentration,  his  dreadlocksfalling  about  his face protectively.Leroy  looked  up.  Everyone was stillagain.   Listening.   "God, I am deaf"he  murmered  to  himself...   then heheard  it.   It was a distant rumblingsound, like a thunderstorm.
<P>
It  paused, then started again, just alittle louder than the first time.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Jesus, I heard it...  I can hear it!"It was Hudson, his face was white.
<P>
"I  can  hear  it  too,  what  is thatnoise?"  Leroy spoke in a softer, morecalmer  voice than Hudson, "It doesn'tmake sense." The other miners, glad tohave  a  "superior"  mind  interested,looked  round at him, expecting him todo  something  or  give  an order.  Hecould  only  stare back.  The rumblingappeared  to be coming from all sides,and  now they heard something new.  Itwas   small   in   comparison  to  thedeafening rumbling sound but it seemedso...   so close.  The mine "groaned",it  was  a  long  high-pitched  whine.Hudson      started      to      shakeuncontrollably, "W-what is it Leroy?".The  rumbling  stopped  abruptly.  Thegroaning began to decrease in pitch.
<P>
He   was   in  a  trance.   Frozen  inposition.   Staring at the others.  Itwas Ricky who brought him round, "It'sa cave-in guys, we"ve got to get outtahere N-O-W!" Then he ran for it.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Wait  Goddammit  -  you"ll get buriedalive...   Ricky!" Jake ran after him,in  an  effort to prevent an accident,but it was too late.  Leroy could onlywatch  as the roof of the mine omittedone  last growl and then collapsed, infront of him.  Ricky screamed, but hisscream  was  muffled as he disappearedunder  an avalanche of rock.  Jake hadsurvived  the main section of the fallbut  was  now lying in a crumpled heapon  the  ground  surrounded  by  largeboulders.   There  were massive cloudsof  unsettled  dust everywhere, makingLeroy's  eyes  sting and water, it wasalso  making  it difficult to breathe.There was only one thing to do though,go in and rescue the bodies.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
It  had  taken  them  ten  minutes  tolocate  Jake"s  body,  and  a  furtherfifteen   to   carry  him  to  safety.Equipped   with   only   two   workingheadlamps  to  guide their way (Jake'shad  been smashed in the fall), it hadbeen  a near impossible feat, but theyhad managed it.
<P>
On   discovering  Jake's  body,  Leroycould   tell  instantly  that  he  wasunconscious.   He had sustained a deepcut  above  the  right  eye  which wasbleeding  badly.   A  large  rock  hadshattered one of his legs to the pointthat a small area of his shin bone wasprotruding  through  the  skin.  Leroyhad  decided  that it would be foolishto stay and treat Jake there and then,when  another rock fall could occur atany moment.  The only other option hadbeen  to carry him back to Terence andwait  for  help.  This was easier saidthan   done,  as  Jake,  standing  (orlying)   at  six  foot  two,  was  notexactly   a  willing  member  to  thisexpedition  -  nor  was the whimperingHudson as a matter of fact.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Leroy  looked  down  upon Jake's body.It  was in a bad way.  He had torn offan  arm of his once-orange boiler suitand  wrapped  it  around  Jake's head.Its   purpose  had  been  a  makeshiftbandage  to  prevent any more bleedingbut it wasn't working very well.
<P>
"What  the  fuck do we do now?" Hudsoncried   despairingly,   startling  thesilence.
<P>
"Well,  basically,  we  sit  here  andwait." Leroy tried to sound calm.  Buthe  wasn"t  calm, far from it in fact.While  he  and Hudson were looking forJake  he  had  noticed  something veryunsettling  indeed.   He  had  noticedthat   the   air   around  him  seemedunusually  still and well, idle.  Moreinvestigation  and  proved  his theorycorrect:   the  air  conditioning  hadshut  down  with  the  lighting.  Theywere  trapped in an enclosed area withlimited oxygen...<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"What  -  you think I'm just gonna sithere  and  die?   'Cos  I'm not - d'yaunderstand?""Really...     yeah."   Leroy   wasn'tlistening  to  him.   His thoughts hadbeen  broken  for a second, but now heblocked  out the intrusion and resumedstaring  into  the  blackness.  He waswondering  what  the first symptoms of"lack  of  oxygen"  were  and  how  torecognise them.  He could just pictureit  as  an  article  for  one of thoseshite Readers Digest magazines...
<P>
ONE:   a  pain  in the lungs, first inone concentrated point, then spreadingthroughout   the   entire  respiratorysystem to include the trachea...
<P>
TWO:   a  sudden  stroke  of dizzinessduring which double-vision and "spots-before-the-eyes" syndrome is not
<P>
unusual...
<P>
THREE:   a  strong  urge to sleep thuscausing -"roy...  Leroy...  I said - "

<P>
"Wha-  what  is it man?!" Leroy jumpedup   suddenly,   "What  do  you  want,Hudson?" Hudson shrugged, embarrassed.
<P>
"I just thought we oughta stay awake -that's  all, y'know, in case somethinghappens to Jake or whatever.  I mean-"
<P>
"Yeah, alright." Then Leroy rememberedthat Hudson was only eighteen and feltsorry for him; "Hey, Hudson."
<P>
"Yeah."
<P>
"We're gonna be alright."
<P>
"Yeah, I know, but...  yeah, I know."<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I  left  the  office  as  soon as youcalled me."
<P>
"Yeah, thanks."
<P>
"What's   the   problem?    You   saidsomething about an accident.  It's notserious is it?"
<P>
"The  new tunnel has collapsed down insector C, sub-level six."
<P>
"Who was down th - "
<P>
"Leroy's  group,  four  of them.  I'vejust checked the rota."
<P>
"Sounds   pretty   bad.    You  reckonthey're alive?"
<P>
"No telling."
<P>
"Shit,  that's  all  we  need - you'vecalled for help?"
<P>
"Yeah,  the  men  should  be  here anyminute now."
<P>
"Alright,  but  just  keep  the  wholething  as  quiet as possible, we don'tneed any more publicity, understand?"
<P>
"Yeah.  Sure."<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Time passed in elastic minutes.  Leroywas scared.  It was pitch black, (theyhad  decided  that  they would save onbatteries  by  leaving their headlampsoff).     Jake's    slow,    drawn-outbreathing  echoed  around  the tunnel,creating a somewhat strange effect.
<P>
"Hudson?"
<P>
"Yeah?" He sounded nervous.
<P>
"I've  got  something to tell you." Heknew this was going to be difficult.
<P>
"Yeah?"
<P>
"We"re  running  out  of  oxygen,"  hespoke  with  grim  determination, "Theair  conditioning shut down.  With thelights."   He  grimaced,  anticipatingHudson"s reaction.   
<P>
"Yeah?"
<P>
That's  all?!   Yeah?  Hudson probablywasn't listening to him anyway.   
<P>
"Yeah."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"So we're going to die then."
<P>
His  eyes  widened  in  the  terror ofactually   realising   what   he  knewalready.   He  was  glad  that  Hudsoncouldn't see him.
<P>
"I dunno.  Maybe."<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"OK  people,  listen  up!   This job"snothing  new  to  us;  there's  been acave-in inside sector C.  Four men aretrapped  down  there and it's up to usto  get  them  out  alive.   Number ofcasualties:  unknown.  It's gonna taketime   though   and  that's  the  mostimportant   factor   on  this  rescue.Time."  Barton Armstrong spat the wordacross  the  room,  daring  anyone  tochallenge him.  He had lead the miningrescue squad for five successful yearsduring  which  he  and  his  team  hadcompleted  scores  of  operations  andsaved  dozens of lives.  He put it alldown to his strong disciplined methodsand often violent temperament.  He wasnot wrong.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  mine  was  silent.  Still.  Leroyshivered.   He felt uneasy about a lotof  things.   He  opened  his mouth tospeak-     but     stopped    himself,remembering his promise to Hudson.  Notalking,  it  wastes  precious oxygen.Common   sense  really.   He  wonderedwhether  or not thinking used up a lotof oxygen.  He didn't think so, but -
<P>
A  blinding  light shone directly intohis face, making him gasp in surprise.It was Hudson.  "Get that light out ofmy   eyes,   dammit!"   Leroy  yelled,screwing    up   his   face   in   thebrightness.   Hudson  lowered his headso  that  the  lamp  lit up the groundbeside them."What  on  earth  do  you think you'redoing,  man!" Leroy blinked repeatedlyas  he tried to adjust his eyes to thenew  light,  "I  thought  we agreed toleave the lamps off!"
<P>
"I thought we said no talking," Hudsonreplied, "Wastes oxygen, you said." Hestood  up,  his  knee  joints clickingaudibly.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Leroy  stared  up at the gangly figureof  Eric Hudson in surprise.  His eyeshad  a slightly glazed look about themand  his  jaw  hung open, giving him asort    of    stupid    and   gormlessexpression.    Leroy   gasped:   Jesuswhat's happened to him?
<P>
"You  know  that  thing  when you feelreally hot and you can't breathe rightand you want to be sick but - "
<P>
"You   mean   claustrophobia?"   askedLeroy, noticing for the first time thesweat on Hudson"s brow.
<P>
"Yeah,  that's it.  Well, I got it.  Igot it real bad, Leroy."
<P>
"You sure?"
<P>
"Yeah.   I have to get outta here now,ok?"  Hudson  started to walk off downthe tunnel towards the rockfall.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Hey  Hudson, you can't do that - it'stoo  dangerous  down there man." Leroyattempted  to  stand up, but fell downagain,  his  head spinning.  He turnedon  his  headlamp  and looked down thetunnel  through  which Hudson had justdisappeared.
<P>
"Eric,  can  you  hear  me?  Where areyou?"
<P>
"Yeah,  I  can hear you fine, I'm nextto  the rocks." Leroy was surprised athow  close the rockfall must have beento   himself   and  Jake.   Under  tenmetres, he guessed.
<P>
"What  the  hell  are  you  doing downthere anyway?"
<P>
"Digging  myself through to the lift."came the reply.
<P>
"You're WHAT?  Hudson, are you crazy?"But  then  he  realised.   Hudson  wascrazy.   "Get  yourself  back here nowHudson!   C'mon  come  back  here  andwe"ll  talk  about  it.  Me and you...and  Jake.   We  can  get through thistogether, man."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"I  can"t  move  this  rock, Leroy, itwon"t budge...  ah, here we go."
<P>
There was a terrifying crash...
<P>
"HUDSON!" ...then silence.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Did you hear that?  Sir, did you h -"
<P>
"Yes,  I  heard  it." Barton Armstronglooked  up  at  the  wall of seeminglyimpenetrable  rock,  "There are peopleon  the  other  side  of this wall andnothing  is  going to stop us reachingthem.   Come,  hurry."  He beckoned tothe  drill  operators,  "Our  time  isrunning out."<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
                 <CENTER>-=-</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"Damn you, Hudson." Leroy groaned.  Helooked down through the tunnel but allhe  could  see  was  a  large cloud ofblack,  choking  dust  moving  in  hisdirection.
<P>
He  shifted his body to ease the crampin  his  legs and pain in his back andsat  up  against Terence, the friendlydrill.  He sighed.  What a day.
<P>
Leroy   could   feel  himself  fallingasleep  and  made  no  effort  to stophimself.  He was awakened by the soundof  a  drill, far off in the distance.As he opened his eyes, a horrible numbfeeling crept over him.  His mouth wasdry  and he felt slightly dizzy.  "Heyman,   I"m   dying"  he  whispered  tohimself,  "Coooool."  he  smiled.   Heheard  a  sound  from somewhere to hisleft  and  turned his head slowly.  Itwas Jake!
<P>
"Jake  -  you  alright?"  Jake did notlook alright.
<P>
"I"m  not  good, Leroy." He forced thewords  out  of  his throat.  They cameagonisingly  slowly,  "What's...  thisthing...  on my..  head, man?""It's  a bandage to stop you bleeding,Jake."
<P>
"Where  the...   others?"  He  noticedthat  Jake had started to dribble fromthe  effort  of speech and turned awayfor the sake of Jake's dignity.
<P>
"They're dead, Jake - both of them."
<P>
"What...  about...  Ricky?"
<P>
"I  told you, he's dead - they're bothdead."<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
"And what...  about...  Hudson?"
<P>
"He"s  dead,  man  -  Goddammit what'swrong with you?"
<P>
Jake smiled, showing his shining whiteteeth.   Leroy looked down on the bodyin  sorrow;  "It  wasn't meant to turnout like this, Jake.""I...  know.  Le...  roy?"
<P>
"Yeah?"
<P>
"I"m...  going to...  die...  now."
<P>
"Yeah..." Jake closed his eyes and wasstill.
<P>
Leroy  was  finding it hard to breathenow;  what  should  have been a short,inhale  of air was now a long and thinrasping  sound.  It was painful, up toa  point where he had started to coughup  blood  instead  of carbon dioxide.His  eyes were aching in the dust.  Hewanted  to  sleep badly but the drillswere  too  loud.  They were all aroundhim  now,  buzzing  and  drilling.  Hewished  they would go away so he couldsleep.   Then  he  could  hear voices,very  close.   But sleep was beckoningand  his eyelids were heavy so he shutthem  and  then  felt good, strong andoh,  so  fresh  and  young again.  Thedrills  had  stopped now and he wantedto open his eyes again so he did.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The  first thing he saw when he openedhis  eyes  was  two,  lifeless  bodieslying  beside  a  large drill.  It wasvery   light  in  the  mine  now,  buteverything  felt  slightly blurred andsoft-edged.   He  recognised the firstbody  straight  away as Jake's but theother  one  he  couldn't  recognise atall.   He  stared  hard.  The body wasclad  with a white hat, orange boiler-suit and a pair of tough, black boots.
<P>
"Wait a minute" he thought to himself,"I  know  those  boots  well.  This isstrange,   Leroy,   I've   seen   thembefore."  He  looked  down  at his ownfeet, hesitantly.
<P>
"...mmmm,  where  are  they?   This isgetting  stranger...  guess I won't beneeding   them   any   more....   verystrange isn"t it Leroy?  Yes, it is."
<P>
He  let himself gaze around the tunnelfor  a  little longer but very soon hebecame bored.  He closed his eyes, butwhen  he tried to open them once more,he found that he couldn't.<FONT COLOR=magenta>
