<P>
<FONT COLOR=cyan>With <FONT COLOR=red>The CRYPT<FONT COLOR=cyan> having recentlypublishing some minority interestreligious rites associated withWitchcraft.  I've been asked by manysupporters of "The Modern LapsedChurch of the Bacchants" to inform<FONT COLOR=red>The CRYPT<FONT COLOR=cyan> readers of the rites and
<P>
observances that make up theircoming "Bacchanalian Festival andFeast days of the celebration ofChrimbo". These rites coinciding withthe traditional Christian (rememberthem?) periods of Christmas and NewYear.
<P>
Having abandoned such outdatedChristian festivals as "HarvestFestival", "Easter" and especially"Lent"; which incidently they regardas an anathema.  They celebrate theirmain religious festival from ChristmasEve to New years day, the period theycall "Chrimbo".  This rolls all theoutdated Christian celebrations intoone massive period of concentratedworship, feasting and abandonment.
<P>
As most of you may know the Bacchantchurch holds regular evening worship,with extra large meetings on Fridayand Saturday nights.  They have placesof worship all over the UK.  Thechurch is very successful in gainingconverts, in fact they claim that inthe UK alone they have over 15 millionmembers!  I myself have seen just howwell attended are their meetings.Their late night meetings are sopopular with the young, that some arewilling to pay up to twenty pounds inentrance fees!<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
         <CENTER>THE CHRIMBO FESTIVAL</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Chrimbo starts in either of two mainways: For normal worshippers itofficially starts with the "Officeparty", this involves the age oldritual of the bosses taking on thebehaviour of ordinary people for anhour or two, even the lowliest can(and often does) regard himself astheir equals, often with direconsequences in the near future.
<P>
Once the communion drinks are flowing(the first usually bought by thebosses), the worship gets underway:kissing old bats from accounts is allpart of the ritual, as is beingembarrassed a fortnight later when younext meet her at work.
<P>
Junior members of the workforce arerequired to do the most embarrassingthings possible and they always do.At least one must be very sick,another takes the part of thetraditional fighting drunk and theoldest man present is expected to havehis stained shirt tails outside histrousers for at least the second halfof these first rites.  However, by farthe most popular exercise - even forthe older party goers - involvessomeone photocopying their bottoms,and handing the copies out.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The alternative way of welcoming thebeginning of the Chrimbo festival forthe congregation is the "Receiving ofthe Bounty of the double Giro", thisis a traditional sign that for a fewdays at least even the most humblewill be allowed to indulge inconcentrated attendance at thefestivals ceremonies.  As degrees ofpiety in the church are measured byattendance, the truly seriousworshipper should be able to stay in apermanent state of worship from the"office party" or "receiving of thegiro" to the final act of thefestivities; the "I didn't do that, Idon't remember anything!" act ofcontrition on New Years day.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>        <CENTER>THE CHRIMBO PILGRIMAGE</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The office party often leads naturallyto another popular Chrimbo tradition.This is the popular "Drop you all offProcession", a common pilgrimage ofmany Chrimbo celebrants.  This journeytypifies the changing goals andconflicting aims of a typicalBacchanalian throughout the year.
<P>
The celebrants prepare as usual with 4hours of devout drinking and eating toexcess.  At least seven pilgrims mustpile into a car for the mysteryjourney.  (After 4 hours of fanaticaldrinking even your own street takes onthe look of a mystery).  The seven inthe car should occupy their time beingsick, grabbing the steering wheel,speaking in tongues, trying to fighteveryone else, mooning and insultingall they pass and most important ofall giving conflicting directions torumoured parties, homes, other pubs, ahole in the wall machine, an offlicence, an old friends house etc.  Ifpossible all these things should behappening simultaneously.  At the veryleast the avowed destination mustconstantly change.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
During this journey it is requiredthat the celebrants avoid at allcosts those people considered mostunsympathetic to all Bacchanalians.To meet one at such a time isconsidered as bringing bad luck in thefuture.  Often this means that inweaving over a busy junction andcausing a pile up, one of thecelebrants will invoke panic byclaiming to have just seen a policecar.  This often leads to either theabandonment of the vehicle and ascattering of the pilgrims.  Or atleast a bit of quiet as everyoneincluding the driver career on at avastly reduced speed with their headsbelow window level.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
If such a bad omened sighting is realthe usual outcome varies from a shorthigh speed chase and crash, to beingrequired to attempt to appear soberwhile blowing into an intoximeter. Theofficial Bacchanalian response atbeing arrested being, "It must bebrokened offisher, i've only had acouple of shandies!"
<P>
All night meetings for seriousworshippers are as popular during theFestival of Chrimbo as at all othertimes of the year.  Places of assemblyare licensed for all night ceremonies.Here is where such     traditionalrituals as "fancy dress", "schoolynights" and "wet T-shirt    compos"are performed.  These celebrations areled by the elect, these being the sortof people who by dint of an accidentat birth followed    by their basicfailure to develop a brain manage toattain the status     of DJs.  Manyare jealous of their accomplishment ofpermanently speaking utter drivel andacting like a perfected idiot withouteven a sniff of alcohol.  These highpriests of fashion and trivia whip thecongregation into a frenzied illusionof enjoyment with the aid of primitivedrumming, howling, capering and thevast quantities of alcohol consumed aspart of the service.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>             <CENTER>THE PENANCE</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Some among the congregation pay fortheir accumulation of a year ofsinning by taking the "Penance ofAlcohol Poisoning".  The rituals youare required to undergo arehumiliating and complex.  Its seen asa sign of Bacchuss' humour that eachworshipper goes through virtually thesame sort of mystical experience.
<P>
First is the formal challenge in whichyou are provoked into drinking adouble gin, whiskey, vodka and rumcocktail after your tenth pint.  Theclutching of the throat is the lastthing remembered before you set outon the mysterious totally blankjourney between the pub and home.  Thenext thing you vaguely remember is thereeling crawl up the garden path.After the traditional "shh shhhhh,very quiet or i'll wake theneighbours/wife" period, during whichyou keep giving in to the urge toswear, sing and shout nonsense at thetop of your voice while breakingwindows, falling over neighboursfences, stray cats, milk bottles etc.you manage to fall through the doorwhere you feel an immediate urge toworship at the toilet bowl.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Once before this object of worship andfocus of your most attentivemeditations for the next few days, youfall to your knees in supplication,head well into the bowl and enter thefirst period of atonement.  This isthe preliminary retching and gaspingfor breath.
<P>
Soon you feel a terrible stirring inyour bowels.  Unable to make anythingapproaching a decision on which endrequires the bowl first, your finallyforced to do both simultaneously.  Ifyou're lucky and you have enough braincells still connected to figure outwhat to do; you may have managed tosit on the toilet and you will beattempting to direct most of the spewbetween your legs as both ends erupt.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Unfortunately for some this is themoment when you have your mostuncomfortable humiliation of theatonement.  Disasters here can rangefrom falling over while desperatelytrying to position yourself on theseat while pulling your trousers down.This can be compounded by rollingaround in panic once the twin eruptionis over.  Partial disasters can rangefrom warmly realising with a wateryeyed sob that you forgot to pull downyour underpants as well, to fillingaforesaid jeans successfully aroundyour ankles with what remains of yourlast meal.
<P>
Its usually at this time that theworshipper starts the spontaneousinvocation of the penitent, this willbe repeated intermittently over thenext few days.  Its very easy toremember as it consists of the sametwo words repeated with varyingstrength of conviction, depending onthe suffering involved. i.e. "Never"followed by "again".
<P>
Now starts the period of vigil wherethe supplicant kneels in an act ofcontrition before the toilet bowl forup to sixteen hours, at first he istoo deep in his suffering to notice orcare that his pants are still aroundhis ankles.  Once he is purged of allthe food and liquids in his body hereaches the second stage of historments.  The dry spasmodic heavestake over, this is when he continuallyretches on an empty stomach, hisstomach continually knotting painfullyand trying to jump up into his throat.All this agonising retching does is tochoke him of air for a few verypainful seconds.  Half an hour of thismakes his stomach feel like its beenkicked repeatedly.<FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
This wretched state of affairscontinues until through exhaustion andmisery the penitent wretch collapsesinto a fitful sleep.  In the next fewdays the words, wretched, dehydrated,miserable, headache, penitent andfragile come easily to mind.  Most ofthe time is taken up with either lyingdown in various stages of sufferingand torment, or feeling slightly worsewhile hunched over hugging the trustytoilet bowl.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>          <CENTER>OTHER FESTIVITIES</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
Other highlights of the celebrationsover the Chrimbo period ofteninclude: "Getting Grandma Legless","Waking up next to a dog", "a bumpin a car" this last is often followedby an impromptu meeting incasualty with fellow worshippers.A common ceremony of Chrimbo is "Afight with the wife" (or girlfriend),this is usually the result of the"Hour of the recriminations andenforced confessional" which is oftenfollowed by the chanting of such oldBacchant favourites before a symbolicclosed door as "I promise never totouch another drop luv..." or "If youwon't let me back in at least throwdown some clothes..." this is oftenfollowed by the humbling penances of"Cold Turkey" or even "Sleeping at theSalvation Army Hostel".
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>     <CENTER>THE FESTIVAL OF SOUR GRAPES.</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
The relics of Chrimbo for a Bacchantare varied.  The following period ofAtonement often includes the rite ofpropritiation: "I know I said Icant remember what I did, but I didn'tdo that! did I?", the "You can't sackme for something I did at the officeparty" supplication and the commonexperience of "Entering the pit ofdespond once the bank and credit cardstatements arrive".  After Chrimbomany for the first time in their livesfeel the calling to "Appear in courtat a later date".
<P>
For the Bacchant who set off into thefestival of Chrimbo clutching a doublegiro the most common relic of Chrimbois a period of enforced fasting, thisincludes the recriminations of tearfulwife and children followed by divorce.This Festival is called "The Period ofSour Grapes and Pit of Despond".  Forsome it lasts until the next ChrimboFestival beckons.  The answer to anysuch feelings of despondency anddepression for a committed Bachant isto go out for a few jars to help himforget.<FONT COLOR=red>
<P>
               <CENTER>SOBER UP</CENTER><FONT COLOR=cyan>
<P>
For some Chrimbo is a time of greatmourning, often because a friend ormember of their family hasinadvertently strayed across the pathof some Bacchanalian revellers in avehicle.  These pathetic Bacchantsinflamed with arrogance andselfishness believe they are able toboth celebrate and drive.  Often withsad or fatal consequences to others.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>(If you think its fine to drink anddrive just remember this is not thecelebration of Chrimbo, it is in facta celebration of personal stupidity,and often injury or death.
<P>
Consequences are something that neverenters the perpetrators empty heads.If your so stupid as to allow yourselfto drink and drive your probably toostupid to be able to read this, anyonedoing so has no such excuse.  If youallow a drunk to drive, or you're sofoolish as to become a passenger ontheir journey into Lamerdom justremember that most human beingsbelieve that no suffering is too badfor these scum.  If you care for themor at least for their possibleinnocent victims:-stop them!  Taxis ora sober driver are easily available.I personally regard drink drive pratsas totally pathetic wastes of life.It may seem fun driving the wrong wayup the motorway with a traffic cone onyour head, but its not that much funfor the person you hit and paralysefrom the neck down...  But yes, apartfrom the pricks, it is a joyous timeof year.  There's nothing quite likewaking up in a hedge with vomit in theturn-ups of your urine soakedtrousers... )<FONT COLOR=cyan>
