                                Lesson Number One
@5
      A  crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day.  A small rabbit
      saw  the crow, and asked him,@1 "Can I also sit like you and do nothing
      all day long?"
@5
      The crow answered: @3 "Sure, why not."
@5
      So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

      All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.

@5
      To  be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high
      up.

@5
      A  turkey  was chatting with a bull. @1 "I would love to be able to get
      to  the  top of that tree,"@5 sighed the turkey,@1 "but I haven't got the
      energy."
@3
      "Well,  why  don't  you  nibble on some of my droppings?"@5 replied the
      bull. @3 "They're packed with Nutrients."
@5
      The  turkey  pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave
      him  enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree.  The next
      day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.

      Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of
      the  tree.   Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out
      of the tree.

      Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.

*2                               Lesson Number Three
@5
      When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss.

      The  brain said,@1 "I should be Boss because I control the whole body's
      responses and functions."
@5
      The feet said,@3 "We should be Boss as we carry the brain about and get
      him to where he wants to go."
@5
      The hands said,@7 "We should be the Boss because we do all the work and
      earn all the money."
@5
      And  so  it  went  on  with  the  heart, the lungs and the eyes until
      finally  the  asshole spoke up.  All the parts laughed at the idea of
      the asshole being the Boss.

      So the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and refused to work.
      Within  a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, the
      feet  twitched,  the  heart  and  lungs  began to panic and the brain
      fevered.

      Eventually  they  all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, so
      the motion was passed.
*2
      All  the  other  parts  did  all the work while the Boss just sat and
      passed out the shit!

@5
      You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do.

                               Lesson Number Four
@5
      A  little  bird was flying south for the winter.  It was so cold, the
      bird  froze  and  fell  to the ground in a large field.  While it was
      lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it.

      As  the  frozen  bird  lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to
      realize how warm it was.  The dung was actually thawing him out!

      He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.

      A  passing  cat  heard  the  bird  singing  and  came to investigate.
      Following  the  sound,  the cat discovered the bird under the pile of
      cow dung, and promptly dug him outand ate him!

      1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.

      2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.

      3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut.
