<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Druidry  is  known  today under three broad time periods:   paleo-
Druids,  meso-Druids,  and neo-Druids.  There is little historical
connection between the three,  but all have sought to manifest  in
the world the continuing spirit of Druidism.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little  is know about the paleo-Druids except what was written  by
those  who  opposed  them:  the Roman Emperor  and  the  Christian
Church.   We  do know that the Druids were not only priests,   but
rather  the intellectual elite of Celtic society in the  same  way
that  Brahmins  were  in Indian society.  They were  polytheistic,
based  their ritual upon the movements of the sun,  and looked  to
Earth  Mother as a source of life.  While their gods and goddesses
had personalities,  the Druids mostly saw the divine manifested in
all  of  nature.   Liminal,  or boundary,  places  were  important
locations  of  the holy.  Gates to the Otherworld  were  found  in
sacred wells, fire, and trees.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meso-Druids  appeared in England in the 18th and  19th  centuries,
and  while  some were an effort to reclaim ancient Druid practice,
for  the most part they were little more than Masonic or Christian
gentleman's clubs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neopagan  Druidism  is  an  attempt to  recapture  the  spirit  of
ancient  Druidism  in the modern world,  even while  we  recognize
that  re-enactment  of   ancient   Druid  practice  is  no  longer
possible.  Druidry today embraces the presence of the holy in  the
Three  Kindreds:   Spirits of the ancestors,   earth  spirits  (of
animals,  plants, streams, rocks, etc.), and spirits of the gods &
goddesses.   We celebrate the fire festivals of Samhain,   Imbolc,
Beltaine,  and Lughnassad,  as well as the soltices and equinoxes.
We  venerate the Three Kindreds,  and we inhabit the Three  Worlds
of Air,  Sea,  and Land. While Druidry is distinct from witchcraft
and  Wicca,   many  neopagan Druids in a  spirit  of  pagan  unity
incorporate such rites into their personal devotional  lives.   In
general,   whereas  Wicca  tends  to  be  private,   small  groups
oriented,   and lunar,  Druidism tends to be public,  large  group
oriented, and solar.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If,   while  walking  through the woods,  you  feel  the  pull  of
comradeship from the trees that surround you,  and in the  singing
of  a  brook  you hear the words of the gods,  if  you  have  ever
understood a rock,  or seen the kinship between a human being  and
a  blade  of  grass,  then you have been touched by  the  timeless
spirit of Druidry.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  ancient teachings of the Druids represent one  of  the  well-
springs of inspiration of the Western Spiritual Tradition.  Druids
were  magicians and poets,  counsellors and healers,  shamans  and
philosophers.  In the early days,  as pre-Celts,  they built stone
circles  and  worshipped Nature with her many  faces.   Later  the
Celts   blended   the   inspiring   esoteric,    mathematical  and
engineering  skills  of these megalithic peoples  with  their  own
flamboyant  artistry and wisdom traditions to create  the  Druidry
described by the Greeks and Romans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although  partly  suppressed  with  the  coming  of  Christianity,
Druidry  continued to live through the work of the Bardic  schools
and the folk traditions and customs of Ireland,  Scotland,  Wales,
England and Brittany.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  18th  century saw a revival of Druid practice which continues
to this day.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"In  ancient  days  there was one great culture,   from  India  to
Ireland:   the   Wise   were   their   healers,    counselors  and
priest/esses.  Men and Women devoted their lives to  learning  and
working  the accumulated lore of their peoples.  They spent  years
in  study,   ritual  and  meditation.   They  spoke  to  and  with
God/desses  and Spirits:  they made magic and taught  wisdom.   As
well,   they were the memory and justice of the folk.  These  Wise
Ones  were known by many names in the many tongues of the  ancient
world.   Brahman among the Aryans,  Flamen and Flamenca among  the
Latins,   Gothi among the Germans and among the  Celts  there  are
called  Druidh  {singular  Drui.   Gaelic  Draoi,   Druidheachd  =
Druidry.}  In  our time there are those who are  called  by  these
images,   these cultural memories.  They wish to light the  Sacred
Fire  in  the  place of the Spirits;  they seek  the  hidden  Holy
Spring in the forest's heart.  They feel called to worship the Old
God/desses and to restore Their honor in modern life.  Some of  us
who  seek these ways call ourselves Druids in honor of the  mighty
Wise  Ones of old.  We seek to walk the Elder Way,  though we  may
not  have the skills fo the ancients.  The work of Druidry is  the
work  of  re-making the connections between our common  lives  and
the  wonder and Magic of the Inner Worlds.  It is the  opening  of
the  Gates of the Soul where before they were closed.  Is  is  the
use  of every Power of the Self - intellect,  feeling,  intuition,
instinct,   and  flesh - to seek the good of all  folk  -  health,
wealth,  and wisdom -and then the secrets of initiation -  wisdom,
love,   and power.  We are beginning to relciam the Pagan heritage
from the rubble of history.  We may never know the forms that  the
ancient  Druidry took.  We strive to make a spiritual system  -  a
religion  and  a  Magic - that the Elder Wise  might  approve  and
understand.   Equally,  we seek to make Pagan religion  that  will
serve the needs of today's folk., and the land in which we live."</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
