<blockquote>
   <p><i><span>    </span>Being a rookie to the PC scene I know sweet F.A about 
  most of it`s software, even less about Windows, so most of the time as far as 
  software is concerned I am working in the dark as they say.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>And after finally deciding quite a few weeks ago to go 
    over to the PC in favor of my old trusty upgraded Amiga 1200 and upon seeing 
    what the PC can do and it`s graphics, sound etc capabilities I am very glad 
    that I did finally get converted. It wasn`t very painful, a plug in this orifice, 
    a junction block up there, a jack plug up there, swap that wire over with 
    that one &amp; (ouch, that tingled a bit) but there you go, sorted….</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>Anyway, I started my new PC life with a pretty mediocre 
    Celeron 677Mhz CPU and god know`s what make of motherboard, plus 128Mb SDRAM, 
    but like I`ve always heard about the PC, when I was over on the miggy, that 
    you need to upgrade a fair bit every so often to keep a fraction in line with 
    the ever-growing PC expansion market, so obviously my next major task when 
    money allowed it was a major upgrade.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>So, which firm do I use? Buying Micro Mart and being 
    presented with oodles of firms all supposedly offering better deals than anyone 
    else I was in part turmoil who to deal with.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>I knew that for such a major upgrade as I was planning 
    for, I was looking at spending around £300, so like most of us I still wanted 
    a pretty good fast and powerful system but as cheap as I could get hold of 
    the parts for, so I decided to shop between two firms here in Rugby, that 
    way I would automatically save 100% of postage &amp; packing charges, so Stak 
    Trading and Star Computer both in Rugby were who I was going to deal with.</i></p>
<p><i><span>    </span>So, on the web I go, Stak`s site was my first port of call, 
  made a few notes of the hardware that I wanted, then over to Star`s site and 
  a few notes of prices of the same items, and working it all out I was going 
  to save about £40 by dealing with the two firms…</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>Ok, so working out what new hardware I wanted was pretty 
    bloody easy, but what processor and motherboard do I go for? God, now that 
    was the hardest part. When on the miggy A1200 you had a choice of about 4 
    different revisions of motherboard of which about 1 maybe two working perfect 
    with most other hardware, do I go for an Intel Celeron Processor, or an AMD? 
    Do I go mad and just from my now 677Mhz CPU and up to one well over 1Ghz? 
    Well, obviously yes, or else it wouldn`t be worth upgrading to one just above, 
    would it.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>So instead of just in for the kill and upgrading I wanted 
    a bit of info from other PC users about hardware, especially users who had 
    got either Celeron or AMD processors in the systems, so after either emailing 
    contacts or phoning them, for every 3 that said “AMD? huh, nah, wouldn`t touch 
    em` with a barge pole, they run too bloody hot&quot;, 3 or 4 others said “Celeron? 
    crap processors, too slow, AMD are the business&quot;, so shit I thought, 
    which road do I take?…</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>Ball Hooks (think about it)….I thought, I`ll go the way 
    I want, and if things go wrong either way then buy replacements and go the 
    other way, an expensive way of finding out which processors are best, but 
    trial and error is the only route.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>So in the end I decided to go AMD and big, well, bigish, 
    an AMD 1800XP running at just a tad over 1.5Ghz sounded good to me, coupled 
    with a good quality motherboard which would allow me to upgrade with another 
    powerful processor in the near future if need be, would give me good scope 
    for the foreseeable future hopefully…</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>Now, these two firms in Rugby, Stak Trading and Star 
    Computers were about 4 miles apart, and £ for £ Stak was slightly the cheaper, 
    but I couldn`t get all of what I wanted from them because new &amp; more powerful 
    upgrades had already come in and pushed the lower ended ones to the back of 
    the queue, but Star had all that I wanted, plus I also wanted to buy a spindle 
    of 100 CDR`s and they were about £5 cheaper at Star, so it`s was them who 
    I gave my business to.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>So, with the help of a m8 taking me in his car to Star 
    I went in, had a nice word with one of the blokes that I was doing a “CASH” 
    sale, and would there be any chance of some discount? “We`ll see” he said, 
    “It all depends on how much your willing to spend”, “about £300-£350” I replied, 
    “great, I`ll sort you out sir”…</i></p>
<p><i><span>        </span>So the order of the day was an AMD Athlon 1800XP CPU, 
  a Jetway V266B motherboard which Star had already fitted the CPU to and pre-configured 
  the m.board.</i></p>
<p><i><span>     </span>A new Seagate 40Gb 7200RPM hard drive, but they had sold 
  out of them, so the same size and speed but an IBM one, ok I suppose, but I 
  was really after a Seagate, nice drives, I always use these in most of my past 
  miggy`s.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>So because the new m.board used either/both SDRAM and the 
    new DDR RAM I opted for 256Mb of the faster DDR RAM, a new Creative SB Live 
    5.1 soundcard, an Intel 56k V90 fax/modem, and a mic/headphones combined plus 
    the 100 CDR`s for £20, all in all that came to just over £340, but for cash 
    they let me have it all for £315, which wasn`t a bad saving, over £25 really.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>And with all the so-called stories about AMD Athlon`s running 
    hot and eventually burning out the motherboard I have found out so far that 
    my CPU is running bloody cool, hardly any heat at all, having said that, the 
    fan is a big powerful one, maybe, as time goes on the m.board will get burnt 
    out by the CPU, there again, it might not, only time will tell…</i></p>
<p><i><span>    </span>Whichever way it all goes, I`m more than chuffed with the 
  systems performance, being involved with computers for some years I also saved 
  a few quid by installing all the h.ware myself, plus I`ve also installed all 
  of the software, however, this part of computing is not my strongest point, 
  resulting in a few bugs here and there, part of it is the fault of Windows XP, 
  part of it is my own lack of software skills, however, the basic system is working 
  ok, it`s just like emailing which sometimes throws a wobbly.</i></p>
  <p><i><span>    </span>Plus, for some reason, I`ve got problem with using the 
    mic to chat with any of my contacts via messenger, although the messenger 
    wizard say it`s all working ok, I have at present, only talked to Steve Evans 
    a while ago, I wanted to chat to Ray Hawkins the other night, but to no avail, 
    so I`ve got to hopefully as time goes by iron out these glitches, but apart 
    from that, the whole system is brill….</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>So, in my case AMD Athlon is Pretty damn good I reckon…. <br>
