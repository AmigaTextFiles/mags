<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ISLE OF ARRAN</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the west coast of the island,  the Machrie Moor standing stones
are  well worth a visit.  Not far from the road,  a small  ancient
circle is protected by a stone wall.  Continue on the footpath and
you will reach the main site,  three-quarters of a mile across the
fields.  In 1993 I visited the two groups of small white  boulders
which lie to the right of the path,  then further down on the left
several  beautifully mysterious tall,  red stones.  An information
notice  explains what little is known about them. </P>






<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ISLE OF JURA</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  are several standing stones scattered about the east  coast
of  Jura.  A Neolithic burial cairn can be found south  of  Strone
farm.   South-east of Ardmenish,  on Lowlandman's Bay is  the  dun
known as An Dunan.</P>

 <FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">KILMARTIN</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 30 miles south of Oban,  the area around Kilmartin is rich in
history.   Around  the  village   many  prehistoric  and  medieval
monuments can be found including burial cairns,  stone circles and
cup-and-ring  engravings. </P> 





<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ISLE OF MULL</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing stones south of  Tobermory.
Before  you reach Dervaig along the road from Tobermory,   if  you
have  a  good map of the area,  you might like to explore some  of
the  nearby standing stones.  You will see a couple marked on  the
map to the left of this road,  then closer to the village are  the
Kilmore  standing stones located just inside  the  forest  on  the
right.   From  there you can go deeper into the forest  and  after
around  half  a mile you will see another clearing containing  yet
more stones by Maol Mor.  Robert Pollock has produced a guide with
diagrams  covering some of these stones.  Further on near  Calgary
(13  miles  west of Tobermory),  there's the Cillchriosd  standing
stone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At  Ardura  you can take a track down to Lochbuie,   home  of  the
MacLaines  and site of Moy Castle and a Bronze Age  stone  circle.
Robert  Pollock  has  produced an excellent  guide  with  diagrams
covering  the  stone  circle and also a  standing  stone.   Seumas
Westland has a photo of Moy Castle too.</P>



<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ISLE OF COLL</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Archaeological  sites on Coll include a  cairn  at  Arinagour,   a
souterrain at the Arnabost crossroads and Iron Age forts  such  as
the ones at Dun an Achaidh and Feall Bay.  Two standing stones can
be found in the west at Totronald.  These are called Na Sgeulachan
in  Gaelic ('teller of tales' in English)  and may have been  used
for  astronomical  purposes  or they  could  have  belonged  to  a
temple.   </P>



<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> ISLE OF SKYE</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  the  lochside at Kensaleyre on the NW coast of the Trotternish
peninsula are some prehistoric stones whose origin is  a  mystery.
Legend  says  that  there were once 3 stones which  were  used  to
support  cauldrons  of  venison stew  for  the  Fiennes  (mystical
giants who threw stones).</P>

 <FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">ISLE OF BARRA</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing  stones  at Borve.  Dun Bharpa is a large  well-preserved
Neolithic chambered burial cairn 2.5 km south of the road  between
Craigston  and Grean (map grid reference NF 671019).   Before  the
turn to Grean and Cleit,  on a low hill close to the road, are the
well-preserved  remains of an Iron Age broch called  Dun  Chuidhir
or Cuier </P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <P ALIGN="LEFT">ISLE OF SOUTH UIST</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About  halfway  down South Uist,  you will see a turn  to  Bornish
(Bornais  in  Gaelic).  Dun Bhulan (on a spur of land  overlooking
the  beach)   is  an  Iron  Age broch  and  settlement.
  There's also a track south  from  Bornish
leading to a standing stone.  On the southern coast of the island,
a  standing  stone  can  be  seen close  to  the  shore  near  the
Pollachar Inn.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between  Clachan  and  Lochmaddy is the  Barpa  Langass  Neolithic
cairn which has an intact burial chamber.  The monument is some 25
metres  in  diameter and 4 metres high.  It is  about  150  metres
south  of  the  road.  One kilometre south-east of  here  (or  100
metres  from  the  end  of the track at Langass  Lodge)   are  the
remains of a stone circle, Pobull Fhinn.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Near Carinish are the ruins of a 13th century church (Teampull  na
Trionaid),   thought to have been founded by the daughter  of  the
warrior  Somerled.  It is signposted 200 metres from the  raod  at
Carinish (Cairinis in Gaelic).  A long cairn, dun and stone circle
can all be found east of here.</P>  


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several  monuments   can   be   found   along   the  road  to  the
Harris/Berneray  ferry  point at Newtonferry  (Port  nan  Long  in
Gaelic).  About 3 miles north of Lochmaddy,  climb Blashaval  hill
to  the left of the road and you will find 3 standing stones known
as  the  Three False Men or Na Fir Bhreige.  Legend  has  it  that
these mark the graves of spies who were buried alive.  You'll find
them on the western slope of the hill.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dating  back over 4000 years,  the Callanish standing stones  rank
second  in terms of importance only to Stonehenge.  On a  headland
overlooking  part  of a huge sea loch,  53  pale  grey  stones  of
Lewisian gneiss stand in a curious cruciform.  Link to my  photos.
The  heart is a central circle of 13 tall stones where excavations
in  the  mid-19th century uncovered a chambered tomb  reported  to
have  contained human remains.  From there four limbs run  out  in
line with the cardinal points of the compass.  Pointing northwards
lie  two  parallel rows of stones which form an avenue of  unknown
significance.</P>










<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together  with eleven smaller sites scattered over the surrounding
moorland,   the main circle   seems  to  have  been  an
ancient  astronomical  observatory.   Detailed  calculations  have
shown  alignments with the sun and moon at various  times  of  the
year  which  could  have  been used to predict  eclipses  and  the
coming of the seasons.  Curiously,  it appears to be situated just
south  of  a sort of lunar "arctic circle" inside which  the  moon
fails  to  rise  above the horizon when it reaches  its  19-yearly
southern  maximum.  </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  are two other stone circles which you can access  near  the
main  site.  They are quite easily seen from the main road  (A858)
just  south  of  the  turn  to  the visitor  centre.   Cnoc  Ceann
(Callanish  II)   is 400 metres from the road  
.  Cnoc Fhillibhir Bheag (Callanish III) is 200 metres from
Callanish II along a footpath.</P>
  
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT"> INVERNESS AREA</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Situated in Glen Urquhart (8 miles west of Drumnadrochit)  is  the
Corrimony  chambered cairn surrounded by a circle of  11  standing
stones. </P>





<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Six  miles  east of Inverness are the Clava Cairns.  These  Bronze
Age  chambered cairns are each surrounded by a stone circle  in  a
wooded field.  A most unusual place. </P>
   




<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <P ALIGN="LEFT">ABERDEENSHIRE</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of  the  richest  areas  for   standing  stones  and  ancient
monuments  -  so  much so that they have created a  'Stone  Circle
Trail' (in addition to the Castle & Whisky Trails).  Check out the
official guide by Aberdeenshire council.  An interesting  starting
point is the Archaeolink prehistory park.</P>
