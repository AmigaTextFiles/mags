<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  young couple left the church  and  arrived  at  the
hotel  where  they  were   spending   the  first  night  of  their
honeymoon. They opened the champagne and began undressing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the bridegroom removed his socks, his new wife asked,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Ewww -
what's  wrong  with  your feet? Your toes  look  all  mangled  and
weird.   Why  are   your feet so gross?"<FONT COLOR=LIME> "I  had  <I>tolio</I>  as  a
child,"<FONT COLOR=TEAL> he answered. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"You mean polio?"<FONT COLOR=TEAL> she asked.</font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"No,   <I>tolio</I>.  The disease only affected my toes."<FONT COLOR=TEAL> The  bride  was
satisfied  with this explanation,  and they continued  undressing.
When  the groom took off his pants,  his bride once again wrinkled
up her nose. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "What's wrong with your knees?"<FONT COLOR=TEAL> she asked. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "They're
all  lumpy  and deformed!"<FONT COLOR=LIME> "As a child,  I also had <I>kneasles</I>," <FONT COLOR=TEAL> he
explained.</font></font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You  mean measles?" <FONT COLOR=TEAL>she asked. <FONT COLOR=LIME> "No,  <I>kneasles</I>.  It was a strange
illness that only affected my knees."</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new bride had to be satisfied with this answer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  the  undressing continued,  her husband at  last  removed  his
underwear.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Don't tell me,"<FONT COLOR=TEAL> she said.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Let me guess... <B>Smallcox</B></font></font></font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=TEAL><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
