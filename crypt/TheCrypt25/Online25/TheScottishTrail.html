<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well to complete our long running series of, <FONT COLOR=WHITE>"North of the Border"</font>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>I decided to give you a brief but guided tour of the areas in
Scotland that I personally have stayed.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A Fortunate career with British Rail means I have travelled this
Country<FONT COLOR=SILVER>(UK) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Extensively, and visited a great many locations. I
was also compelled to move home several times to ensure progress
within my career.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I will start off by a quick explanation of my Name ...<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> FYVIE<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (Five-
E) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>A Strange name to say the least<FONT COLOR=WHITE><B> :)</B></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Fyvie is actually a small village and Castle/estate in Aberdeenshire
Scotland.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most Fyvie's living today are descended from one of two ancestors:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Alexander Fyvie<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (?-1678) <FONT COLOR=AQUA> of Methlick, Aberdeen referred to as  the
Fyvie's of Methlick William Fyvie<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (1668-?)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  of Peterhead and later
Old Deer, Aberdeen referred to as the Fyvie's of Deer.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So How did FYVIE become a Scottish Surname? Well no one can be
truly sure, However rumour has it that these two men fought and
excelled themselves in the defence of FYVIE castle and were
subsequently rewarded by being allowed to adopt the Castle/Estate
name as their own.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">How true this is, remains to be seen, But FYVIE Castle was a main
fortification in Scotland around this time, and the battle called
"The Skirmish of Fyvie" was fought in 1644.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The fact remains that the Surname of FYVIE was unheard of until
Alexander Fyvie and William Fyvie suddenly appeared, and all
Fyvies to this day should be able to trace their ancestry back to
one of them.</P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Fyvie  was  once a royal stronghold,  one of a chain of fortresses
throughout medieval Scotland.  From 1390,  following the Battle of
Otterburn,  five successive families created probably  the  finest
example of Scottish Baronial architecture.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>An  old  tradition claims that these families - Preston,  Meldrum,
Seton,  Gordon and Leith - each built one of Fyvie's five  towers.
An  air of mystery is created by the ghosts and legends associated
with this castle.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>The  oldest  part  dates from the 13th century,   and  within  its
ancient walls is a great wheel-stair, the finest in Scotland.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Contemporary panelling and plaster ceilings survive in  the  17th-
century  Morning  Room and the opulence of the  Edwardian  era  is
reflected  in  the interiors created by the first  Lord  Leith  of
Fyvie.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>A  rich  portrait  collection includes works by Batoni,   Raeburn,
Romney,   Gainsborough,  Opie and Hoppner,  and there  is  a  fine
collection of arms and armour, and 17th-century tapestries.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>The  grounds  and loch were designed as a landscaped  parkland  in
the early 19th-century.  The old walled garden is being re-created
to show traditional Scottish fruits and vegetables.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Visitors  can also enjoy the restored racquets court,  ice  house,
bird hide, restored earth closet and beautiful lochside walks.</I></P>
