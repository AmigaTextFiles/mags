        <font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
        graphic arts, the genesis of a project.</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        August 1998 I undertook this project, that devoted me for about three 
        months, Although the album had arrived to the end of the production, at 
        that time no distributor was here yet, so we did not know when it would 
        come out. Nevertheless I did my best to realize the cover as if were a 
        personal project.<br>
        At first the scene was conceived in a different way: a guitar inside a 
        cage, in the middle of a science fiction laboratory. Both the former and 
        the latter should look older, out of context and in an alien and metallic 
        environment as the one in the laboratory.<br>
        After the realization of some sketches in plan and in section of the laboratory, 
        I was about to do the first preliminary test, but I soon realized that 
        that kind of environment was not suitable for the cover of a CD; besides, 
        I could not &quot;feel&quot; emotionally the scene, which made the creative 
        process difficult; another kind of stage was necessary, maybe with a vertical 
        development without volumetric limits upwards and downwards. Some time 
        ago I was to try a personal achievement, that had as protagonist an alien 
        temple whose peculiarities were very similar to the ones of the film Alien; 
        in fact I had the intention to draw inspiration from the bio-mechanics 
        themes, characteristic of the graphic designer <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>H.R. 
        Giger</b></font>.<br>
        Then I thought that it would be the ideal approach for &quot;<b><font color="#FFFFFF">The 
        Cage</font></b>&quot;, and I saw before my eyes the achieved project; 
        maybe this is the first time that the final result is the perfect materialization 
        of the original idea.<br>
        I began to jot down the first sketches that allowed me to start the modelling 
        of the scene. Obviously <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>LightWave</b></font> 
        was the right candidate.<br>
        In parallel I had to define the material that made the whole scene characteristic: 
        I needed to get a metallic look of the surface without using reflecting 
        materials, almost by accident I managed to do at once what I wanted.<br>
        I realized all the patterns for the mapping using Personal Paint 7 by 
        Cloanto on Amiga; for the hall arches of the tunnel I used as reference 
        the scanning of hand-made drawing, which I used for the modelling too.<br>
        As the project developed, I realized that I needed some effects which 
        I could realize in the volumetric rendering engine of LightWave 5.5: making 
        the same things in a different way would have made me waste my time and 
        the result wouldn't have been the same. Moreover, I had to consider to 
        deal with the high number of polygons that the scene could reach, besides 
        the great number of calculation to render the surfaces treated with fractal 
        textures, and with thick patterns for the for the bump mapping that took 
        the whole sight.<br>
        A t the beginning I decided to set the scene with the help of Amiga 4000, 
        making tempts on limited areas, and after proceding with more complete 
        tests on PC 133 of my office, but even in this way the success of the 
        work was compromised by the long waiting times that were necessary to 
        Amiga 4000 to complete even little attempts; this would have forced me 
        to make compromises not to inflate in a excessive way the time of production. 
        So I decided that I needed to pass on to more productive hardware and 
        software, therefore I equippedmysel with a more popwerful machine and 
        I upgraded LightWave to the last version.<br>
        The first attempts of rendering of the altar in the middle of the scene 
        excited the customer for the choice both of material and shapes, so I 
        quickly procedeed following the way just undertaken for the preparation 
        of the scene.<br>
        Once the scene was composed according to the project, I had to realised 
        a set of light that would create the right atmosphere, working at the 
        same time on the volumetric effects of the smoke and of the source of 
        light.<br>
        Later on I had to improve the materials complying with the lightning of 
        the set, and adding step by step new object and details not to make the 
        environment too barren.<br>
        The drape that partially hides the guitar was one of the last ideas together 
        with the discharges of energy that hit the cage. The last improvements 
        and adjustment took me time, patience and a certain effort again, because 
        I had to analyse the work done, because I had to analyze the work done 
        done until then i a objective way.<br>
        The internal pages of the booklet have been created in a week, taking 
        back partially the oroginal idea of the laboratory but keeping the style 
        of the cover.<br>
        Here some numbers to give you an idea of the size of the work: </font>
