<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our last offering,  I made mention of the closure of a complete main line 
following the invocation of the "<I>Beeching Axe</I>",  and would like to touch on this 
subject in greater depth.  I refer,  of course,  to the Great Central Railway,  which 
ran from Marylebone station through to Sheffield and beyond.  This railway had 
been borne with a tunnel to the continent in mind,  long before the existing one 
was even designed,  and built with a continental loading gauge in mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Marylebone station itself was originally intended to be much larger than it is;  but 
the days of railway expansion were at an end,  and it remained  as it was with just 
four platforms.  Of the twin access tunnels,  only one was ever used.  Probably the 
only existing Railtrack terminus to possess a turntable and an olde worlde style 
about the station,  it has been subject to a plethora of film makers,  and a popular 
venue of steam specials since the closure of the original main line.  The station has 
recently undergone a major re-vamp however,  so it's allure may well have gone by 
now.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The route of the line ran from the suburbs of London through  High Wycombe and 
Aylesbury through Buckinghamshire to Brackley in Northamptonshire via Woodford 
Halse.  From there,  it crossed the midlands through Rugby and followed the route 
of the M1,  crossing the M1 to pass through Leicester on it's way to Nottingham 
via Loughborough,  Ruddington,  and East Leake. From there,  the line joined with 
the Great Northern line for access to Sheffield and the north,  and though the line 
has long since gone,  evidence still remains in the form of station buildings,  still 
there for those with an architectural interest to enjoy.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The G.C.R. was the last main line to be built in Britain,  and came at a time when 
the main infrastructure of railway operations had been well established. Highly 
unusual in the respect that it passed through far more open countryside than any 
other mainline, and was reasonably straight in it's path,  the G.C.R.'s customers 
were treated to some very fast timings indeed.  These became a form of "trade 
mark" of the line,  and provided some spectacular standing starts for the enthusiasts 
in to the bargain.  Moreover,  the fast freight services known as "Annesley 
Windcutters" were something near legendary.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These fast freights ran between Annesley and Woodford Halse employing Ruddles 
9F class 2-10-0's,  due to the heavy loads involved<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>about 1000+ tons of coal per 
train</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>,  and were a financial mainstay of the line.  The sight of one of these was 
quite spectacular,  to say the least!  Complete villages grew around these freight 
services to accommodate railwaymen working in large complexes,  but this proved 
to be anything but beneficial at the line's closure.  The result was villages full of 
railwaymen but no railway,  and a frugal bus service!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The G.C.R. was taken under the wing of the London and North Eastern Railway 
fairly early in it's lifetime,  providing an interesting mixture of locomotive stock,  
including B17's,  A1's etc.,  and special workings provided the additional interest of 
Halls,  Castles etc. from the G.W.R. and the occasional Southern region loco.  To 
this extent,  the G.C.R. was a magnet for enthusiasts along it's length,  and has 
provided a home idyllic for preserved steam locos.  Three small sections of this 
once proud main line still remain,  Ruddington (recently acquired from Railtrack), 
Loughborough to Leicester,  and a stretch in the Aylesbury area,  all of which are 
home to preservation societies.  In it's latter years,  the G.C.R.  came under control 
of the L.M.S.,  a previous rival,  and it's subsequent fall from grace was started.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The L.M.S. had little love for the G.C.R.,  indeed,  if anything,  this was the 
opportunity to eradicate the opposition.  Freight haulage costs escalated,  resulting 
in less business. Freight traffic started to drop in volume,  and overheads increased. 
The rot had already started,  but for no good reason,  as nationalisation was just 
around the corner,  when all became one.  The effect of the L.M.S. action,  
however,  continued to smother the G.C.R.,  and the optimization plans of Beeching 
for the railway network further compounded the situation,  leaving the G.C.R. in an 
extremely vulnerable position.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diesel traction was the new fad now,  and steam locos were beginning to show the 
effects of minimalistic maintenance from 1939 on - the G.C.R. ended it's days with 
the stigma of being a steam loco's graveyard with long lines of disabled locos 
destined to be broken up for spares,  or removal to the scrap yards.  The timings of 
trains was still tight,  and this proved fatal to a great many locos.  It also created a 
factor of unreliability with the scheduled services,  which only lent itself towards the 
eventual partial,  then complete closure,  of the line.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There's a saying that "<I>What goes around,  comes around</I>".  How laconic it is to 
discover that now we have a channel tunnel,  an enterprise wishes to re-instate the 
line of the G.C.R.;  maybe we still possess men of vision in our country,  I'd rather 
like to think so, for I consider the construction of another railway elsewhere as 
being a fools paradise.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'd like to share an experience of a G.C.R. fireman with you all from the earlier 
days of the railway,  so here it is - enjoy !</P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"He was a funny old chap" (said the fireman)," one of the many drivers 
I had not then met since my transfer to the shed a few months 
earlier.  Why they had picked me to fire on a through-the-night 
excursion train to London I don't know, except of course that there 
were a lot of mid-week-excursions being run at that time and most 
sheds were using all their spare men.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure where the train started from or how many portions it 
had, but we waited for it at Sheffield Victoria and we found we had 
a 'Sir Sam'.  There were only a few of these on the whole line and I 
had never fired one and so I was not sure what to expect.  The 'Sir 
Sams' were big hefty-looking engines that ought to be able to pull 
anything, but I had not heard any good reports about them.  There 
was not a lot to worry about, as we only had six on and plenty of 
time allowed to get to London.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I asked my mate what he thought of the prospects.  Would we be all 
right with this class of engine?  He said we could do the job just 
as well with a 'Pom-Pom'.  In fact we would be better off with 
a 'Pom-Pom'.  Nothing like a good 'Pom-Pom' for getting away from 
stations or for getting up a hard bank.  When he was young, 'Pom-
Poms' ran London excursions as often as not and nobody asked for 
anything better.  Still the 'Sir Sam' would do at a pinch.  It all 
depended how much ash the coal made.  If it was bad she'd probably 
not be steaming by the time we were on Wendover bank, but we'll get 
through somehow.  But don't put too much in the back of the box up 
the banks; if you do it won't burn right and so she won't steam.  If 
you want to put plenty at the back, wait till you get to the top of 
the bank.  You can do with a lot at the back when we're going down, 
because the fire'll shake itself to the front if she's a bit rough.  
Anyway there's nothing to bother about just yet.  And off we struck 
at 1.24 of a fine morning.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My mate didn't hurry her and I didn't hurry either.  She started to 
blow off after a mile or so and I gave her a round of coal with 
plenty at the back.  This took us over the hump at Darnall and my 
mate let her roll with the regulator a shade open down to Beighton, 
where I started firing to get her up through Killamarsh to 
Eckington, where we were booked to stop.  My mate said, "We might as 
well pick up at the trough" and we did, just before he shut off for 
Eckington.  You would wonder whether it could be worthwhile to stop 
at twenty to two in the morning at a place like Eckington, but 
that's how it was.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we stood my mate said, "There's a pub just here called 
the "Sitwell Arms" but they tell me it's nothing to do with the 
seats.  It's just the name of the local gentry.  One or two writers 
among 'em I believe."</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Off we went after a couple of minutes on a bit of downhill and then 
a mile or so of climbing to Staveley Town.  We did not stay long 
this time, and we turned to the right to get to Chesterfield.  So 
far as I could judge from these short runs she seemed to be steaming 
all right, and after leaving Sheepbridge I put a heavy round on the 
fire to build it up for a bank from Chesterfield up to Heath.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About a couple of minutes was enough for each stop (more than 
enough, you would think, for passengers without luggage) and after 
Chesterfield I could hope to see what sort of condition the engine 
was really in.  My mate thought so too and he blasted her out of the 
station and under the Midland line as if he was trying to wake 
everybody up.  He kept her at it up the bank and I gave her every 
chance by firing four shovelfuls in a round on a pretty white fire.  
She seemed all right, steam keeping up to the red mark on the gauge 
even with the injector going.  What more could we want?  My mate 
seemed pleased with the engine and with me and said it looked as if 
we were going to have a good trip.  He made her cough pretty hard on 
the last bit up to Heath and she threw a spark or two, and so I took 
a careful look in the box and covered a couple of thinnish spots 
near the front.  She steamed all right and when he eased her a bit 
after passing Heath she blew off for a bit.  If she would keep like 
this all the way we'd nothing to complain about.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Pilsley my mate eased the regulator right back and said "She'll 
run to Nottingham now.  Look at the scenery now if you like and if 
you can.""  </P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next time out,  we'll be taking a look at catering (with an anecdote from our very 
own Mr. Ian Fyvie) and some of the stranger designs and oddities of the railways in 
a pictorial format.  Until then,  stay well.</P></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
