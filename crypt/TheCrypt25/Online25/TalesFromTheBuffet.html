  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. James Thomson was less then happy as he sat behind the 
    wooden desk, Perhaps it was the Long overnight journey on the Inter-City sleeper 
    from Glasgow to Inverness, Or even the wind and rain he had faced upon departure 
    from the coach, despite this being the start of Summer. What ever it was ...His 
    mood was not of the Best. Mr. Thomson ...Personal Officer for BTH (British 
    Transport Hotels) assigned to the Train Catering Division (Soon to be called 
    Travellers Fare) and sent to Inverness to recruit 4 new staff for the Train 
    Catering operation in Inverness.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4 New Staff ...That was all he required to complete his task, 
    He had already interviewed 8 people, Finding success in only 3 of them, The 
    rest he had discounted for a variety of reasons, Perhaps they lived to far 
    from the Train Station, Maybe they had Tattoos visible (Against Catering Regulations) 
    Or generally they just did not Suit. Whatever the man sitting in front of 
    his desk, was the last person to apply, Failure would mean another long trip 
    overnight and more time away from his beloved family.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Thomson slipped his hands under his glasses and rubbed 
    his Eyes, He was tired, so very weary, The bumping and jostling of the Sleeper 
    had kept him awake most of the Previous night, The breakfast of Tea and 3 
    Digestive Biscuits, Had not improved his mood, Nor had the Wash or shave in 
    the Mini sized Sink with lukewarm water on board the Sleeper.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Removing his hands Mr. Thomson again looked at the Young man 
    sitting across the Desk from him.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>So ...Mr. Fyvie!</I>" <FONT COLOR=WHITE>.... <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>Let 
  me get this straight ... You are a timeserved Fitter Welder?</I>" <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes Sir.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>You have had 4 employers in the past two years?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes Sir.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>You have absolutely no Catering experience ..What-so-ever?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">No Sir ...Except from making the lads tea when I was an Apprentice.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Thomson released a long loud sigh.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>Can you give me one single reason ...Why I should offer 
  you employment?</I>" <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Eh! <FONT COLOR=SILVER>.... (Long Pause) ...<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>No.</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW> <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>Well at last we 
  appear to have something in Common</I>"<FONT COLOR=SILVER> Sighed Mr. Thomson. 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Thomson shuffled the Application forms on the Desk 
    in front of him. He was not a Man prone to hasty or abrupt decisions. His 
    tired eyes darted to the large clock on the Room wall.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.00 hrs ..The last day train would leave in twenty minutes, 
    If he was not on that, It would be another uncomfortable night on an Intercity 
    sleeper, Another night and day before he could enjoy the Comforts of his Family 
    Life.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Thomson again looked at the fresh faced young man sitting 
    across the desk from him, 25 years old and engaged to be married, The man 
    certainly was tidy and well presented, He looked the Part, He seemed confident 
    enough ...But no catering experience.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James removed his glasses and holding his head sideways, 
    again glanced at the young man, His eyes again flitting to the Wall Clock 
    (16.08)</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A long hiss of air escaped for Mr. Thomsen's lips.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Right ... I will offer you employment as a Train catering 
    Steward, But only on a Three Month Trial Period ...Is that acceptable to you?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Yeah ..Great<FONT COLOR=SILVER> ..Smiled the Young Man.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>OK! ... Monday morning ...come to the Station 
    Cafeteria and you will be issued with you Uniform and work roster</I>"</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME> <FONT COLOR=SILVER>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The young man stood up from his seat, both Shook hands, with 
    Mr. Thomson (Looking Doubtful) issuing a final sentence.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Don't let me Down</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16.15. ... Both men left the Office, Ian Fyvie headed to 
    the Station bar for a celebration Drink, My Thomson to the Glasgow Train. 
    Neither of them could have possibly known, that the Conversation of the past 
    15 Minutes would lead to a Career spanning 17 Years ...Or leading this un-qualified 
    Summer Steward to achieve Management Status in a very short time.</P>

      Inverness Train Catering
    </CENTER>
  </H1>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1975 Inverness was a busy Train Station, Well certainly 
    during the Summer Season, When the Highland town was awash with Tourists. 
    The Train carting Depot at Inverness was the 3rd largest in Scotland (Just 
    behind Glasgow and Edinburgh). The Catering fleet included 1. full restaurant 
    car (Inverness to London) 2 Griddle Cars (Grilled Meals Between Inverness 
    and Glasgow/Edinburgh) Several DMU (Diesel Multiple Units) Mini Buffets (One 
    man vehicles) Running between Inverness and Aberdeen. Also two RMB's (Full 
    sized Buffet Cars) Running between Inverness and Wick/Thurso.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Busy Summer season also saw the Inclusion of Catering 
    Vehicles on the Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh line and a variety of "Special 
    Trains" running to suit the various specifications of the Companies hiring 
    them.</P>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Railway line between Inverness and Wick/Thurso ran three 
    trains each day, Two of which contained Catering Vehicles (RMB's)</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both these services (06.15 & 11.10 departures) were incredibly 
    busy in the short summer season, However the long Winters Proved to be ...Perhaps 
    the Quietest Service on British Rail. Indeed the Catering service on these 
    trains could never make a Profit, The losses of the Winter season easily gobbled 
    up any profit made in the Summer, However as the Journey from Inverness to 
    Wick/Thurso took 5½ hours (And often longer in Winter conditions) British 
    Rail deemed it necessary to retain catering facilities on this Service. Now 
    many of you, Who travel by Train, May wonder why the Buffet/Restaurant car 
    does not always open Immediately upon departure.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simple! ...When a Steward boards a Catering vehicle, All 
    Sellable Stock (Food/Drink etc.) must be counted and checked against the Stock 
    Sheets left by the Previous Steward.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Antiquated It may have been, But the System was simple. You 
    had stock sheets listing the Amount of the Goods on the Train. You checked 
    these figures were correct, Added any stores you received, Thus giving you 
    a Grand Total ...30 minutes prior to your arrival in the Home Station, You 
    again counted the Stock ... a Simple subtraction would give you the Daily 
    sales ..and eventually the Amount of Cash you had to Pay into the Booking 
    Office.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e.g.. The Stock sheet might show 100 cans of "John Smiths 
    Bitter" on board. The New Steward had to check this Figure to ensure it was 
    correct. If, For example there was only 90 cans on board and the Steward had 
    not checked, At the End of the Day ...HE would have to pay, Out of his own 
    Pocket for the Missing 10 cans.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inverness/Wick/Thurso line was A summer season joy to 
    behold, Tourists to Britain want to travel the length and breadth of the Country, 
    Wick/Thurso is the furthest North the Railway System runs.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However in the Winter months the Service is almost empty, 
    The only exception to this was the 06.15 (1975) This train was mobbed leaving 
    Inverness, But only because of the Oil Workers travelling to Dingwall (30 
    minute journey) to catch their connecting train to Kyle of Lochalsh.</P>

      The Experience.
    </CENTER>
  </H1>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the first things you learn when you join a company such 
    as British Rail, Is that very quickly you lose your individuality, and merge 
    into what can only be described as the Railway Family.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Regardless of you employment or Skills .. Be it portering/Driving 
    or catering ..First and foremost you are a Railway Man.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now People out there Might view the Job of a Buffet Steward 
    as a rather Downbeat type of job. Just standing there in BR. Red uniform serving 
    Tea & Coffee to thirsty passengers ..Sound easy.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">However very quickly I began to realise that the job involved 
    a lot more that ....I had the Responsibility to care for my fellow workers 
    ...My Railway Family.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A Prime example of this ...Would be when working on the 06.15 
    Inverness to Wick train.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon departure from Dingwall Station, The Steward on Board 
    would Sweep through the Train with a Black Refuse sack, Disposing of all the 
    Debris caused by the Oilrig Workers .. However one commodity did not find 
    its way into the Rubbish Bag .. Newspapers.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Steward collected all daily Newspapers from the Table and 
    took them back to his Catering Vehicle ... Why?</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inverness to Wick line Runs through a lot of Open Countryside, 
    Often some of the Railway Workers Houses are situated close to their Place 
    of Work (<I>Signalboxes/Level Crossings etc.</I>) Often a great many miles 
    from a Village or shop.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In places like this .. Newspapers are delivered by The post 
    office (<I>Postman</I>) Now Mondays paper ..By the time it had muddled its 
    way through the Postal System would not be delivered to the Home until Tuesday 
    possibly even Wednesday.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However in true Railway style the problem was overcome. At 
    this time Tea & Coffee was served on the trains in "<B>MaxPax</B>" (<I>Cardboard 
    cups with Granules already in them</I>). These cardboard cups could get very 
    Hot, So BR designed paper collars to slip over the Cups and so providing a 
    little insulation for the Customers hands.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These Paper collars made ideal "<B>Napkin type Rings</B>" 
    which fitted a rolled up Newspaper like a Glove .. All A steward had to do 
    as open the Train window and throw the Newspaper into the Garden of the passing 
    house. (<I>Sounds difficult but is remarkably easy with a little practice</I>) 
    ..Therefore railway workers in remote areas were delivered a Morning Daily 
    Newspaper.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gratitude you would think? ... No way ...Believe it or not, 
    One morning a PW Worker (<I>Permanent Way ..Track</I>) stormed into the Buffet 
    car and loudly complained to me, That the Steward the Previous day had delivered 
    a "<B>Daily Express</B>" instead of the Normal "<B>Daily Record</B>"</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even trying to explain that (a) I was not on duty that day 
    .. Or (b) Perhaps the Steward couldn't get a "Record" that day. Was no consolation 
    to the Demented Railwayman. His Wife was collecting tokens from the Record 
    and now she was missing one ..It was my fault<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :)</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now the Job did not just concern the delivery of Free daily 
    papers to other Rail staff.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No! .. Even Joe Public got into the act. You see the north 
    of Scotland is dotted with remote houses (<I>Gamekeepers/Gillies/Shepherds 
    etc.</I>) Often these houses are mile from anywhere .. Their weekly supplies 
    of food or drink is by means of a Grocers Van arriving once a Week.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fine in the Summer, But often in the Height of Winter the 
    area can suffer Snowdrifts of up to "Twenty Feet". Of course in instances 
    like this There is only one way to get fresh food supplies.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Train Catering Steward.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes often in the Dead of Winter the Train would pull into 
    some forlorn station and there would be 5/6 women, all clad in heavy wintercoats 
    and wearing Headscarves to keep out the Chill wind.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Door on the Buffet car would be flung open, and the Steward 
    handed every womans "<I>Shopping List</I>" ..Plus Money.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">On arrival at Wick ..It was a quick dash to the nearest Supermarket 
    ...Eventually arriving at the Check-out ...the trolley groaning under the 
    Weight ... Pay for the good and back to the train.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back on board the Shopping was stored into cardboard boxes 
    ..One for each woman. You know the Strange thing was ...Each woman seemed 
    to know exactly how much her shopping would come to, And God help you if you 
    short changed her by 10p.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Stewards reward for all this Public Services ... Well 
    ..They were generous at New Year time .. Often a line of people at an out 
    back station giving the Steward a half bottle of Whisky for helping them out.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They might have known the price of shopping but sadly didn't 
    know the Train Catering Roster ..Often the Steward getting the New Year Gift 
    ...Had perhaps just worked the train on Two occasions that year<FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
    ;)</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the First lessons a Catering Steward quickly learnt, 
    Was that Any Railwayman under the level of Management, Expected to get their 
    Tea or Coffee gratis. If you were approached by a Train Guard and he asked 
    you for a Cup of tea and a sandwich, You charged him for the tea at your own 
    peril. (<I>Each Railwayman has their own way of extracting revenge upon another</I>)</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general terms this is not a problem, The Stewards do tend 
    to carry Tea & Coffee for their own consumption. However Things are not always 
    what they Seem.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I Remember one morning, A man approached the Counter and 
    asked for a Cup of Tea and Packet of Biscuits .. A quick glance at him revealed 
    he was wearing a black Donkey Jacket, With the Double Arrows railway insignia. 
    The man was served and Payment offered and Refused.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Nah! ..Yer alright Mate</I>"<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :)</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The man thanked me and went and sat down, had his tea and 
    biscuits and gave me a cheery wave as he Disembarked at the Next Station.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now for around the next three months this Pattern followed 
    suit, Always the man having got his Free Tea and biscuits and went and sat 
    down ...Some railwaymen stood at the Counter and chatted to you, Others like 
    this man seemed a bit more private, So it was not unusual.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">However ...The Summer season hits Inverness like a tornado, 
    One day the Train is deathly Quiet ..The next its standing room only.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">My first day of real business, The man approached and was served 
    as Normal, But as there was no seating room, he had to remain at the Counter.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Time to strike up a conversation<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :)</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Hows things mate ...Are you busy just now?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Aye ..Always busy in the summer"<FONT COLORR=AQUA> he replied 
    shaking his head.</font></P>
  <FONT COLORR=AQUA> <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>What is it you do at Alness? ...Do you work in the Station 
    or the track?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The mans eyebrows Knitted together as if he did not understand 
    the Question.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"OH! ...No .. I work on a Farm just down the road, I'm a tractor 
    driver"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>But your wearing a Railway Jacket?</I>"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Aye I got it from my Brother in Law ...It keeps you warm on 
    the Tractor as it hasn't a cab"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So there is was .. Myself and I dare say, every other Steward 
    in Inverness had been dishing out Free Tea and Biscuits to this "<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Merry 
    Ploughboy</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>" for the Last three months.</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say ...He wasn't the Happiest customer the Next 
    day, When he had to start paying like everyone else<FONT COLOR=WHITE> ;)</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now its not only the Train Crew and Passenger that make use 
    of the Buffet Car. In stations like Wick, There was no cafeteria, So it was 
    not unusual for the Platform staff to pop in for a Quick cup of tea or buy 
    a pack of Cigarettes.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now at Wick Station (1975) there was a certain Gentleman there 
    who was known as "<B>Daft Davy</B>"</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Davy didn't actually work for the Railway, "Davey" was not 
    one of nature's most blessed when it came to looks and intellect. <font color=RED><font color=WHITE><font color=silver><font color=LIME><font color=WHITE><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=SILVER><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=SILVER><font color=YELLOW><font color=LIME><font color=SILVER><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=SILVER><font color=LIME><font color=SILVER><font color=LIME><font color=SILVER><font color=RED><font color=WHITE><font color=RED><font color=AQUA><font color=RED><font color=AQUA><font color=WHITE><font color=AQUA><font color=WHITE><font color=AQUA><font color=WHITE><font color=AQUA><font color=YELLOW><font color=WHITE><font color=AQUA><font color=WHITE><font color=YELLOW><font color=LIME><font colorr=AQUA><font color=YELLOW><font color=AQUA><font color=LIME><font color=YELLOW><font color=LIME><font color=AQUA><font color=RED><font color=AQUA><font color=WHITE><font color="AQUA">He 
    was a penny short of a shilling, if you know what I mean.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    </font>Davy appeared at Wick Station Mondays/Wednesdays & Fridays (<I>The 
    other week days I am lead to believe he appeared at the Wick Mart</I>) Davy 
    helped load or unload the mail etc. from the Guards van, On payday all the 
    Wick Staff put their loose change into an Envelope, and presented to Davy 
    as "<B>His Wages</B>"</P>
  </font><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It was the start of the Summer Season when I first encountered 
    Davy, Being a man of few words he approached the Counter one day and simply 
    said <FONT COLOR=blue>"TEA"</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=blue> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Davy of course got his Tea, However as the weeks passed, Davy 
    came one day and started to construct a sentence.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"TEA and FAGS"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now it was really Busy in the Summer and Steward did make a 
    lot of cash by either getting Tips or Drinks bought for them.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Soft Hearted fool I was ...I gave Davy his Tea and Fags, But 
    didn't charge him.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Every day after that ...Davys grotesque face would split into 
    a giant grin when he saw me behind the Counter, and he would run down the 
    Corridor for his<FONT COLOR=BLUE> "Tea and Fags" </font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now I didn't really mind this ...In the Summer ..But as Winter 
    approached and the Train got quieter, I suddenly realised I had to put a stop 
    to this Free Cigarettes ...(<I>I was just not making enough Tips to cover 
    the Costs</I>)</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">So when Davy arrived and demanded his usual.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"TEA and FAGS"</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I explained to him as nicely as Possible, That I couldn't afford 
    to give him Free "<B>Fags</B>" in the Winter time.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A hurtful and Pained expression came over Davys face, Suddenly 
    his features distorted into what I assumed was Anger.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"I KIN PAY"</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> screamed Davy.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>OK then</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I sheepishly said ...Realising 
    only to well that I had hurt his feelings.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I gave him his tea and Twenty Embassy Red.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Davy thrust out his hand.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">It contained a Jumble of assorted Coins (<I>possibly amounting 
    to no more than around 36 pence</I>)</P>
  <FONT COLOR=WHITE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">What could I do? ... What would you do?</P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I took two ten pence coins from his hand ..said thankyou and 
    slipped them into the Till.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">From that day forth, My relationship with Davy was slightly 
    more strained.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>TEA and FAGS ...I KIN PAY</B>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA> would 
    shout, But after the first day he no longer offered a jumble of loose change, 
    But always exactly 20p.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I had made my Bed ...And had to lie in it.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Then one day on arrival at Wick ..Davy made his usual approach.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>TEA and FAGS ....I KIN PAY</B>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> he slapped 
    his 20p on the Counter.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I gave Davy his tea but turning to the Cigarette shelf, Realised 
    I had sold out of his Embassy Red, and all I had left was Players No6.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I picked up a 20 pack gave it to Davy, and stuck his 20p in 
    the Till.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>NO RIGHT</B>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Shouted Davy ..while waving 
    the No6 in front of my face.</font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<I>Sorry Davy but that's all I have</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  ...Moving to show him the Shelf containing the Cigarettes 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now in all my year of Life ..Its seldom that Words Fail me ..But 
    I'll never forget the Expression on Davys face ..When he uttered just one 
    Word.</P>
  <FONT COLOR=BLUE>"<B>CHANGE</B>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Yup ..He might have appeared as a simpleton, But he was clever 
    enough to know No6 were cheaper than Embassy and wanted his Change.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Shaking my head I went into the Till and gave him, 5p change.</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Davy continued to con me for the rest of my time on that Circuit, 
    And the big toughie that I am, I never had the Heart to tell him where to 
    go<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :)</font></P>
