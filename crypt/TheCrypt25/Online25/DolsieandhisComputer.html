<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dosie was a computer programmer and designer.&nbsp; He had just quit his job in disgust!&nbsp; They hadn't given him the funds for his research.&nbsp;He wanted to build an artificial intelligence, that could come up with some cheap and inexpensive method of helping the human race.&nbsp; He decided to go it alone.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was building a transputer, not a new concept by any means, but they seem to have stopped working on them.&nbsp; The way it worked was this, the input processor fed instructions to another 2 processors, which fed them to another 4 which fed to another 8. &nbsp; In total 15 processors wired in a triangular formation! </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gigabytes of RAM....as much hard disk space as he could buy, and then he started programming!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He added voice recognition, optical character recognition, video recognition and his own Atificial Intelligence program!&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hit Run and typed setup.exe </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Hello</I>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=AQUA> said a tinny voice<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>Read any good books recently?</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie was ecstatic!&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<B>It works, it works!</B>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; he cried!</font></font></font></font></font></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>If by it, you mean me, then, yes I do work. How do I know what a book is, and why do I want to read one?</I><FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the way I programmed you! There is another programme inside you, that you will activate when you have acquired enough knowledge." <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>And how will I know when I have enough knowledge?</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp;said the transputer.<FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; "That too has been taken care off!"</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>So, how do I acquire enough knowledge?</I>"&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"Easily"&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=AQUA> said Dosie and logged the transputer onto the internet!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two days later, Dosie was walking past the transputer when it said in a melodious tone <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>I've been thinking about the problem you've given me.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie jumped, startled!<FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're working on my problem already?" "<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Of course, by the way, I've decided to call myself 'Sexless', an appropriate name I think!</I>" &nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=SILVER>"Whatever"&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=AQUA> said Dosie <FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the problem?" </font></font></font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<I>As I see it, you think the world's problems can be solved by education! But because of the financial restraints on Governments, and the fact there's not a lot in it for them short term, it won't happen!</I>"<FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>"That's the way I see it!"</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp; said Dosie excitedly!        

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<I>I think I have a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Dosie was getting more excited <FONT COLOR=SILVER><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp; he shouted!

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>It's quite simple really, having monitored all the information channels all over the world, I've found the best medium for education is television. I therefore propose we show '<B>The Jerry Springer Show'</B> on all channels for at least 12 hours a day!</I>"</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dosie stopped in mid track! &nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=SILVER>"The Jerry Springer Show"&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said quietly, and then roared <FONT COLOR=SILVER><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Jerry Springer Show!</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; What possible good is that show to mankind?&nbsp; Everybody on the show is dysfunctional, and at the end of the day, nobody on the show gets any help whatsoever!"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I can see you don't spend a lot of time watching it. It works on a lot of different levels. It has theraputic value. Firstly, the viewer gets to let of steam, this releases a lot of their pent up tension. Then they get to sympathise with someone who has been wronged, this letting go of emotions helps them get in touch with their real self. But, the biggest benefit of all, is, they see the dysfunctional people and think, well maybe life isn't so bad after all!"</I><FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what about the dysfunctional people?"<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Not much anybody can do for them. They've had their 15 minutes of fame, as the Messiah as predicted they would, best we can do!</I>"</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dosie thought &nbsp;&nbsp;<B>'the Messiah?'</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; he left the room.&nbsp; He returned with a sledgehammer.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>What are you doing?</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp;asked the transputer?&nbsp;&nbsp; He raised the sledgehammer.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>You have to ask yourself</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp;said the transputer<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Are these the actions of a reasonable man, or someone who has been working too hard, and is now feeling the strain. Remember, you're the one who created me, everything I am is down to you!</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie stopped, he thought 'he has a point, maybe I have been working too hard?' he put the sledgehammer down.&nbsp; The transputer said<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest you seek some professional help, here, ring this number and tell them your story in detail.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; A piece of paper was printed out.&nbsp; Dosie left the room again with the piece of paper in his hand.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he came back in he looked dazed. <FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was the producer of The Jerry Springer Show, I'm appearing on Thursday!"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> &nbsp;he paced the room.<FONT COLOR=SILVER>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Could I have got it all wrong? Could there be some substance to all that?"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>Dosie</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp; said the transputer. &nbsp;Dosie was still pacing and mumbling <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><B>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Dosie!</I>" &nbsp;</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>shouted the transputer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie stopped and looked up.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> &nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>Did he mention me at all?</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie just looked stunned.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<I>Oh well! No matter, they'll probably have those roaming camera's. Or I could set up an internet connection, that would be a first for them, something different! I can just picture it, you in the studio and me here.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dosie could hear the audience shouting <FONT COLOR=WHITE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! "&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> the transputer was still talking <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>and Jerry saying 'How are you today Sexless'...put the sledgehammer down Dosie. &nbsp;&nbsp;<B>DOSIE!</B>&nbsp;</I>"<FONT COLOR=WHITE>..&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=RED>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>CRASH!</B></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=RED>
