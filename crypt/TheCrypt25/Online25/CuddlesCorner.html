<P ALIGN="LEFT">One  day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making  love.
All of the sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window.  As the
young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina.  The  woman
started  screaming, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Oh my god,  help me,  there's a  bee  in  my
vagina!</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  husband  immediately  took   her  to  the  local  doctor  and
explained the situation.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The doctor thought for a moment and said,<FONT COLOR=LIME>  "Hmm, tricky situation.
But I have a solution to the problem if you would permit me, sir."</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  husband,  being very concerned,  agreed that the doctor could
use  whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.  The
doctor said, <FONT COLOR=LIME> "Okay,  what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the
top  of  my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina.   When  I
feel  the bee I'll withdraw my penis and the bee should follow  my
penis out of your wife's vagina."</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  husband nodded and gave his approval.  The young  lady  said,
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<I>Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it!</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">So  the  doctor  covered  the tip of  his  penis  with  honey  and
inserted  it  into the young lady's vagina.  After  a  few  gentle
strokes,  the doctor said, <FONT COLOR=LIME> "I don't think the bee has noticed the
honey yet.  Perhaps I should go a bit deeper."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> So the doctor  went
deeper  and  deeper.  After a while the doctor began shafting  the
young lady very hard indeed.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The young lady began to quiver with excitement.  She began to moan
and groan aloud.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The doctor,  concentrating very hard,  looked like he was enjoying
himself.   He then put his hands on the young lady's  breasts  and
started making loud noises.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At  this  point  the  husband suddenly  became  very  annoyed  and
shouted,  <FONT COLOR=SILVER> <B>"Now wait a minute!  What the hell do you think  you're
doing?"</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The doctor,  still concentrating,  replied, <FONT COLOR=LIME> "Change of plan.  I'm
gonna drown the bastard!"</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On  a  tour of Scotland,  the Pope took a couple of days  off  his
itinerary  to visit the North coast near Aberdeen on an  impromptu
sightseeing trip.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">His  4X4 Popemobile was driving along the golden sands when  there
was  an  enormous  commotion heard just off  the  headland.   They
rushed to see what it was and upon approaching the scene the  Pope
noticed  just outside the surf,  a hapless man wearing an  English
Rugby  jersey,   struggling frantically to free himself  from  the
jaws of a twenty-foot shark.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At  that  moment a speedboat containing three men wearing Scottish
rugby tops roared into view from around the point.  Spontaneously,
one  of  the  men  took aim and fired a harpoon into  the  shark's
ribs,  immobilizing it instantly.  The other two reached  out  and
pulled the Englishman from the water and then,  using long  clubs,
beat the shark to death.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They  bundled the bleeding,  semi conscious man into the speedboat
along  with the dead shark and then prepared for a hasty  retreat,
when they heard frantic shouting from the shore.  It was of course
the Pope, and he summoned them to the beach.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Upon  them  reaching the shore the Pope went into  raptures  about
the  rescue  and  said, <FONT COLOR=WHITE> "I give you my blessing  for  your  brave
actions.   I  had  heard  that there were some  racist  xenophobic
people  trying to divide Scotland and England,  but,  now  I  have
seen  with  my  own eyes this is not true.  I can  see  that  your
society  is  a  truly  enlightened example of racial  harmony  and
could serve as a model on which other nations could follow."</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">He blessed them all and drove off in a cloud of dust.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As  he  departed,   the  harpoonist asked the  others, <FONT COLOR=LIME>  "Who  was
that???!"</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"That," <FONT COLOR=AQUA>one answered,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>  "was his Holiness the Pope. He is in direct
contact with God and has access to all God's wisdom."</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=LIME>"Well," <FONT COLOR=AQUA> the harpoonist replied,<FONT COLOR=LIME>  "he knows f--- all  about  shark
hunting.  How's that bait holding up or do we need to get  another

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Uncle  John was in the fertilized egg business when I  was  young.
He had several hundred young layers,  called pullets,  and 8 or 10
roosters  whose  job  was to fertilize the eggs.   My  uncle  kept
records,  and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well  went
into the pot and was replaced.  This took a lot of time.  So,   my
uncle  got  a set of tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.
He  could then sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency  report
by listening to the bells.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My uncle's favorite was Brewster Rooster.  A very fine specimen he
was,  but his bell had not rung all morning, so Uncle John went to
investigate.   Several roosters were chasing  pullets,   bells  a-
ringing.   Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't  ring.
He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one.
Uncle was so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county  fair,
and  he  was an overnight sensation.  The judges not only  awarded
him the No Bell Prize, but also the PulletSurprise.</P>

It had two eyes,  four legs, a tail, weighed about three stone and
had  a very odd willy.  The willy in question was six inches  long
and had four little pointy bits sticking out of it.</P>

it's willy should be but could only see a small bloody patch.   It
assumed that during its sleep,  another animal had come along  and
bitten it off.</P>

get  the shakes,  and you get pains in all your fingers and  toes.
But eventually,  it's a very calm way to go.  You get numb and you
kind of drift off,  as if you're sleeping.  How about you, how did
you die?"</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

to the second floor,  but no one was hiding there either. I ran as
fast as I could to the attic,  and just as I got there,  I  had  a
massive heart attack and died."</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">Modena,  Italy:  The Ferrari F1 Team fired their entire  Pit  Crew
yesterday.</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  announcement  was  followed by  Ferrari's  Decision  to  take
advantage  of  the Irish Government's "Work For the  Dole"  Scheme
and hire unemployed youths from Hollyhill area of Cork.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  decision to hire them was brought on by a recent  documentary
on  how unemployed youths in Ireland were able to remove a set  of
car  wheels  in  less  than  6 seconds without  proper  equipment,
whereas Ferrari's existing crew can only do it in 8 seconds.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This  was  thought  to be an excellent yet bold  move  by  Ferrari
Management,   as most races are won & lost in the  pits,   Ferrari
would  have  an  advantage  over   every  team.   However  Ferrari
expectations  were  easily exceeded,  as during  the  Crews  first
practice session;  not only were "da boyz from the Hill"  able  to
change  the  tyres in under 6 seconds but within 12  seconds  they
had  resprayed,  rebadged,  and had sold the vehicle over  to  the
McLaren Team for four dozen pint bottles of Bulmers.</P>
