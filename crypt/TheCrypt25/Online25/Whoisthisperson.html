&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> It began one night in Manchester, a baby boy was born to a Miss Beryl 
  Jones (I was adopted by the Hyde Family), anyway, Beryl gave birth to what can 
  only be explained by the words “Oh My god, why me doctor”, they took one look 
  at me and instead of smacking my bum they smacked my real mums <span class=GramE>face 
  !</span>THWACK!!.</span></i>
<p></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Was this person hailed to be the antichrist?, no, 
    was he hailed be the second Adolf Hitler?, no, was he suspected of starting 
    the great fire of London?, hmmm, we`ll have to think about that one</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>For this unfortunate misfit of life Dr Jekyll was 
    actually born as a result of a genetic experiment that went terribly wrong 
    between a 60`s hippy and a Michael Parkinson look-alike compo winner</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Needless to say, the scientist who lead and performed 
    the experiment has now been sent to </span></i><st1:City><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";"Times New Roman"'>Coventry</span></i></st1:place></st1:City><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Courier New";"Times New Roman"'> 
    (he has <span class=GramE>literally</span>)</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Mr Beryl Jones was at home on the 26<sup>th</sup> 
    January 1951, when she felt a strange sensation in her stomach, it all started 
    with a violent shudder from her womb, then a hot flush came upon her, vomiting 
    soon followed, then it eased off a little, then all hell broke loose (BRRRRRRRR) 
    was the noise all neighbours for ten streets around her heard, was this the 
    time that her unborn child was about to set food into our world at?, no, it 
    was that bloody egg-fried rice and three 25 and two 16 that she got last night 
    from the crappy Chinese takeaway run but two dwarf sisters, one sister had 
    one of her boobs that was a 34c and the other boob was a 65ff, hence her name 
    of Won Hung Lo</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The other sister was called sosaw, but that`s another 
    story</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Eventually at about 22.30 which in new money is about 
    30 mins past 22, little Steven Jones was hatched into an unsuspecting world, 
    the pod opened and there he was, hoofs a shining, claws a glowing and a big 
    red zit on his chin, god, what a sight for sore eyes, or was it sosaw…</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Anyway, the following morning mum wanted to pay the 
    doctors and nurses for all their kind help in delivering her beautiful (hmmm) 
    baby thingy, but they wouldn`t hear of it, they ordered her to leave this 
    place, and to never darken their doorstep again, plus, the top surgeon begged 
    mum not to mention which hospital had given her <span
class=SpellE>sanctitude</span>, just in case they were closed down</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>It was only last month that the name of the hospital 
    was finally given out, of course the hospital closed some years ago, but <span class=SpellE>it`s</span> 
    name was St <span class=SpellE>Pricklehurst</span>, so, the kind doctors and 
    nurses nicknamed the little baby Steven after the hospital, so for many years 
    <span class=SpellE>Steve`s</span> nickname was St Prickle, but during later 
    years, hearing of the terrible misfortune and stigma that the hospital tried 
    to hide, St Prickle was finally shortened again to “Prick”, and folks, that 
    name still bounces around people lips to this very day.</span></i></p>
  <p><i><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>What a loving <span class=SpellE>gesture</span>….</span></i></p>
