<CENTER>"I'm off to piggin'  Balackpool, for two days, maybe three",</CENTER>
<CENTER>Were Lizzie's words of parting, that she uttered to me.</CENTER>
<CENTER>"It's bound to flaming rain there," and rain was what it did,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"This flippin' business conference will make me flip my lid."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>The cabbie, she was early,  and off our Lizzie set,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With words like "See you later, is there something I forget?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>But that was not the end of it, I do regret to say,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All hell was yet to break out,  when she returned today !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>~Twere windy up in Balackpool, it blew an evil blow,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It got to certain places, that you shouldn't really know.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And trams were right expensive like,  at one pound a shot,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Was Lizzie right impressed with it?  She certainly was not !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>On her return from Balackpool,  things went from bad to worse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The railway service didn't help,  the reason for this verse.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A phone call proudly announced, the straight through train is here,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Another call assured me, "And now I'm out of here.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I've had a little trouble,  I couldn't shift my gear,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I'd got to the doorway,  I was then trapped in here.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'm on the way to Milton Keynes, as that's the train's next stop,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then on a return service I'll simply have to hop."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Forty five minutes later,  the phone it rang again,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"I'm outside the station,  I've managed to de-train.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of taxi's there's no single sign," she started to complain,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"I'd better pick you up from there,  and save you extra pain."</CENTER>
