<P ALIGN="LEFT">Is there really anyone out there who has not heard or played at least one version of Geoff Crammond's GrandPrix. This game has been around almost as long as home Computers, Yes even on the OLD Amiga platform. Indeed thanks to devoted fans of the game, Who have developed "Third Party Editors" You can still "Upgrade" the original Amiga version (Or any other PC version ..for that matter) to include New cockpits, Car colours and updated drivers, So bringing the game to todays standards.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Writing a review of a long running game like GrandPrix ...Is not the easiest thing in the world. Everyone who plays this game ..Do so to suit their own tasted or skills in a Fomula 1 racing car.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Those who just want a quick speed around the circuits or want to challenge for the Drivers championship, May have all the driver aids switched on, While others preferring a real life simulation, will turn them all off and depend on their driving skills to try to win races (In this mode it really brings home just what a difficult job these guys have in trying to stay on the track)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OK! ..Grandprix 4 will cost you around the £40 mark ... But surely version 4 is really an upgrade from GrandPrix 3 (Or 3 2000 to be precise). So perhaps many of you who have purchased GrandPrix 3 and updated it with the editors, will wonder if it is really worthwhile spending good money to this newer version.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well in short ...The answer is two fold. (1) If you are content with your version and just enjoy the odd spin around various circuits ...Then perhaps you should save you cash. (2) However if you enjoy motor racing and want the latest, greatest game on the shelves today ...This is a Must. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Read on and discover why.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Grand  Prix  4  is  based  on the FIA Formula  One  World  Drivers
Championship,  which is probably one thing that will  turn  a  few
people  away  from this title considering that  other  titles  (F1
2002)   have been released this year with all the current  drivers
and  manufacturers.   While the menu system  has  been  completely
overhauled,   all  the familiar options from  the  previous  three
Grand  Prix games are there,  plus a few new additions.   Some  of
these  additions include far more detailed track data  (like  what
speed for each corner at a particular circuit)  performance review
(which  allows  you to look at your past races  and  how  you  are
going)  two new driving aids (traction control and launch  control
systems) and a jump start option.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  different  modes of game play have not changed  from  earlier
versions  with  the  exception of "Quicklaps".   QuickRace,   Free
Practise,   Non-Championship Race and Championship are  all  still
included.   Players settings still include Ace,   Pro,   Semi-Pro,
Amateur  and Rookie which will be of benefit seeing that depending
on  which  difficulty mode you select the  game  will  adjust  the
driving aids and AI accordingly.  While this is not a new  feature
it allows for everyone to enjoy the game;  from the person who has
never  played an F1 Simulation right up to the die-hard,   petrol-
heads who play non-stop.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Graphics  options within the game are once again handled  straight
up by an in-built calibration option which runs the first time  to
start  the game.  While this is most probably a sensible  way  for
the  developer to let you see how they would like  it  to  look  I
would  still  suggest you get in there and  tweak  it  up  to  the
highest setting your machine can handle.  A nice addition  to  the
game  is the full implementation of EAX Hardware Supported  Sound.
This  makes  for  excellent sound effects and is fast  becoming  a
standard by which all games are measured.  This is also calibrated
the  first time the game is run and again I would suggest you  get
in and set it up to your liking.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Multiplayer settings are once again included with the game but  to
many  die-hard  fans dismay there is no "internet" option.   While
the  multiplayer mode uses the familiar TCP/IP protocol,   getting
it running across the internet will be another thing which may  be
left  up  to the Grand Prix Community to solve.  Included  in  the
previous expansion pack for Grand Prix 3 was GPaedia.  This  again
provides a valuable resource for new comers to sit with and  learn
some of the finer details about the Formula One Sport.  Also  full
video  explanations are now incuded in each section  of  the  cars
and  drivers,  tracks,  how to set them up for racing and  finally
pitstops.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  major  problem with Grand Prix 3 was the lack of driving  views
to  choose from which has now been fixed.  Thanks to many  GP2/GP3
sites  the people behind Grand Prix 4 have realised that in  order
to  stay  at the top they must adopt change and listen  to  gamers
from  all  over the globe.  Thankfully this has been done  with  a
number  of  new  driving  views to suit everyone's  needs.   These
include the very popular driver position,  rear view and now a  tv
cam  view of racing.  While the implementation of this is  not  as
good  as  seen in F1 2002 its still a lot better than having  none
at all.  Also included are the old rear and front views, both left
and  right side pods,  nose and gearbox cams.  This makes it  very
easy to see all the action from any point on the car.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With  a new graphics engine this game makes the most of some  very
impressive  features  and  it shows in  the  attention  to  detail
around  some  of the circuits as well as with the car  shapes  and
liveries. </P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">One  major part section that was lacking  in  previous
versions  was  the  pitstop.  Grand Prix 4 now includes  the  most
detailed pit crew in any F1 Simulation.  A full complement  of  18
mechanics  lovingly pour over your car when  you  visit  the  pits
during  a  race meeting.  Not only that,  when you are testing  or
practising they can still be seen coming out to lift you  off  the
jacks  and  make sure that the pit exit is clear.  If this  wasn't
enough,   when an accident is so bad and you manage to  limp  back
around  to  the pits these guys will push your car back  into  the
garage so that they can take a look at it. This is fantastic.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  function that was introduced in the Grand Prix 3 Expansion Pack
was  full replays.  Once again this has been included and improved
upon  and depending on your machine you can record as much  or  as
little of the on-track action as you like so that you can view  it
from one of more than 10 different angles.  A new addition to  the
replay  function  is  when viewing a  wet  race  the  camera  lens
actually  shows  the rain drops hitting it and trickling  down  to
the  bottom.  This makes viewing wet weather replays all that more
realistic as you get a sense of what the race was like.  This is a
very nice touch.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Something  else  that will have long GP supports  excited  is  the
damage  model for Grand Prix 4.  This has to be one  of  the  most
detailed models in a driving simulation to-date.  The cars can  be
broken  up into the smallest of pieces which is not the  best  way
to  win races but for the purpose of this review a number of  them
were  damaged beyond repair.  Hit another car and bits  of  carbon
fibre go flying in all directions.  Lock up a brake and the wheels
squeal in pain,  not to mention the smoke and glowing brake discs.
Ride  a  curb hard and you can not only feel every bump  but  hear
the  car bottom out on the road surface.  These are just a few  of
the  feelings  that this title produces and it does  it  extremely
well.</P>

   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally this title shows how much the Grand Prix Series  of  games
has  matured over the years.  With fantastic attention  to  detail
and  graphics to match the other titles currently on the market  a
few things do let it down.  The most important of these would have
to  be the lack of a 2002 Season.  This will either be made by the
public  at  large  or  maybe even released as  an  expansion  pack
similar to Grand Prix 3 Season 2000.  The other problems with  the
game  include longer drivers names not being displayed  completely
on  the  tv  screen  overlays and the machine specs  to  get  this
running  like  a  Ferrari on race day.  Make not mistake  this  is
going to be the ultimate F1 Simulation mainly due to the depth  of
detail it provides.  Just when you think you have seen it all  the
smallest  of  detail will catch your eye and you will  be  amazed.
Even  with these few small problems Grand Prix 4 will no doubt  be
hailed as "King".</P>
