<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While you may not think that an external hard disk is the kind of
gadjet to set your heart thumping, think again. Just as you can
never be to rich, You can never have too much storage space on
your PC.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being a seperate device and weighing only half-a-pound, the Iomega
HDD Portable is an excellent storage medium or devive for moving
files from machine to machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simply attach the little dock to your computer using the supplied
cables, Plug in the disk itself and it appears 
on your Computer screen like any other disk drive so you can copy
imformation to and from it using the Mouse - Its storgae capacity
starts at 20gb (<I>20/40/80/120 gigabyte models available</I>) - Almost
as much as some new computers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you want to keep it permanently attached, you can even install
programs on it since even the smaller version is as big as many of
the hard disks inside the computers you'd buy in the high street.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, Iomega includes a full back-up Program to help you
make copies of important information as well as a Back-up-as-you-
go program that automatically takes a copy whenever you save
anything. You can then unplug the disk and put it somewhere safe.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speed freaks should note that this has been designed to work with
computers equipped with UBS 2.0 ports, but will happily work with
old ones, Just not so fast.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a version for computers with Firewire connectors
(<I>Where you'd Plug in a digital video camera</I>) and all models work
with Apple Macs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can certainly pick up an Internal Hard Drive a lot cheaper,
However if you have already fitted extra hard drives and still
require more storage space, or if you require a storage medium
that is Flexible. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Iomega HDD Portable Drive is Ideal.</P>
