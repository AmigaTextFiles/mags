<font color=aqua>Anthony Hoffman </font> -  " Top effort guys, the HTML version of the mag is just like the DMC one, only a bit slower to load. Another thing I like about the site is there's no annoying Shockwave or Java to get in the way. Keep up the great work!!  "<p>

<font color=aqua> Ian Anderson  </font> -  "    I like the disks and all the articles on them. I think that if you are going to have as much to put on them it would be easier to use a CD. I am sure it would be MUCH better than 100% Amiga. The Crypt is 200% better than that! "<p>
<font color=aqua>   Paul Dixon  </font> -  "  there is definately alot of info on the Amiga I didn't know, and I can't believe that there are still games coming out.   "<p>
