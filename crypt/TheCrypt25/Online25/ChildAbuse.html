<CENTER>My son came home from school one day,</CENTER>
<CENTER>with a smirk upon his face.</CENTER>
<CENTER>He decided he was smart enough,</CENTER>
<CENTER>to put me in my place.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>"Guess what I learned in Civics Two,</CENTER>
<CENTER>that's taught by Mr..Wright?</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's all about the laws today,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The "Children's Bill of Rights."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>It says I need not to clean my room,</CENTER>
<CENTER>don't have to cut my hair.</CENTER>
<CENTER>No one can tell me what to think,</CENTER>
<CENTER>or speak, or what to wear.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I have freedom from religion,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and regardless what you say,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I don't have to bow my head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and I sure don't have to pray.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I can wear earrings if I want,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and pierce my tongue & nose.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I can read & watch just what I like,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and get tattoos from head to toe.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And if you ever spank me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'll charge you with a crime.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'll back  up all my charges,</CENTER>
<CENTER>with the marks on my behind.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Don't you ever touch me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>my body's only for my use,</CENTER>
<CENTER>not for your hugs and kisses,</CENTER>
<CENTER>that's just more child abuse.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Don't preach about your morals,</CENTER>
<CENTER>like your Mama did to you.</CENTER>
<CENTER>That's nothing more than mind control,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And it's illegal too!</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Dad, I have these children's rights,</CENTER>
<CENTER>so you can't influence me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>or I'll call Children's Services Division,</CENTER>
<CENTER>better known as C.S.D.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Of course my first instinct was</CENTER>
<CENTER>To toss him out the door.</CENTER>
<CENTER>But the chance to teach him a lesson</CENTER>
<CENTER>made me think a little more.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I mulled it over carefully,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I couldn't let this go.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A smile crept upon my face,</CENTER>
<CENTER>he's messing with a pro.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>The next day I took him shopping</CENTER>
<CENTER>at the local Goodwill Store.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I told him, "Pick out all you want,</CENTER>
<CENTER>there's shirts & pants galore.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I've called and checked with C.S.D.</CENTER>
<CENTER>who said they didn't care</CENTER>
<CENTER>if I bought you K-Mart shoes</CENTER>
<CENTER>instead of those Nike Airs.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And I've canceled that appointment</CENTER>
<CENTER>to take your driver's test.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The C.S.D. is unconcerned</CENTER>
<CENTER>so I'll decide what's best.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I said "No time to stop and eat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>or pick up stuff to munch.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And tomorrow you can start to learn</CENTER>
<CENTER>to make your own pack lunch.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Just save the raging appetite,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and wait till dinner time.</CENTER>
<CENTER>We're having liver and onions,</CENTER>
<CENTER>a favorite dish of mine.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>He asked "Can I please rent a movie,</CENTER>
<CENTER>to watch on my VCR?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Sorry, but I sold your TV,</CENTER>
<CENTER>for new tires on my car.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I also rented out your room,</CENTER>
<CENTER>you'll take the couch instead.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The C.S.D. requires</CENTER>
<CENTER>just a roof over your head.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Your clothing won't be trendy now,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and I'll choose what we eat.</CENTER>
<CENTER>That allowance that you used to get,</CENTER>
<CENTER>will buy me something neat.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I'm selling off your jet ski,</CENTER>
<CENTER>dirt-bike & roller blades.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Check out the "Parents Bill of Rights,"</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's in effect today!</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Hey hot shot, are you crying,</CENTER>
<CENTER>and why are you on your knees?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Are you asking God to help you out,</CENTER>
<CENTER>instead of C.S.D..?</CENTER>
