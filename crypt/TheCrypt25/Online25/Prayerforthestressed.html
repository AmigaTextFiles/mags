    <center><h1><font color=red> Prayer for the stressed </font></h1></center>
<center><br><br>
<p>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.</p>
<p>The courage to change the things I cannot accept.</p>
<p>And the wisdom to hide the bodies of those I had to kill today </p>
<p><span class=GramE>because they got</span> on my nerves.</p>
<p>And <span class=GramE>Also</span>, help me to be careful of the toes I step 
  on today.</p>
<p>As they may be connected to the feet I have to kiss tomorrow.</p>
<p>Help me always to give 100% at work.</p>
<p>12% on Monday,</p>
<p>23% on Tuesday,</p>
<p>40% on Wednesday,</p>
<p>20% on Thursday,</p>
<p><span class=GramE>and</span> 5% on Friday.</p>
<p>And help me to <span class=GramE>remember ...</span></p>
<p>When <span class=SpellE>I`m</span> having a bad day and it seems that people 
  are trying to wind me up,</p>
<p>It takes 42 muscles to frown, 28 muscles to smile,</p>
<p><span class=GramE>and</span> only four to extend your arm and smack  someone 
  in the face.</p>
