<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scene  of  the last major battle fought on mainland Britain.   The
final  Jacobite uprising ended here on 16 April,  1746,  when  the
army  of  Prince  Charles   Edward   Stuart  was  crushed  by  the
Government forces,  led by the Duke of Cumberland.  Turf and stone
dykes  which  played  a  crucial part  in  the  battle  have  been
reconstructed  on  their original site  as  part  of  a  long-term
strategy to return the battlefield to its condition in 1746.   The
original Leanach Cottage,  which survived the battle being  fought
around it,  has been restored several times and is now open to the
public,  with Living History presentations during summer.  Also in
the  Trust's care are the Graves of the Clans,  the  Well  of  the
Dead,  the Memorial Cairn,  the Cumberland Stone and the Field  of
the  English.   The  Visitor Centre houses  a  permanent  Jacobite
exhibition,   including an 18th-century sampler commemorating  the
battle,  purchased with co-finance from the Heritage Lottery Fund,
and a historical display.</P>
