<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In icy waters off Newfoundland in 1775, sailors on The Herald climbed aboard the 
battered ship Octavius.  A chilling sight greeted them below deck.  The captain had 
frozen to death slumped over his log and behind his were his crew, frozen in their 
bunks, huddled in blankets.  The captain had written the first part of the journey 
when it sailed north of Alaska into frozen waters in his log, 13 years earlier.  The 
log ended there.  The Octavius, with frozen cargo on board, continued the voyage 
sailing thousands of miles before drifting into the icy waters off Newfoundland.  
The voyage of Octavius, sailing the north-west passage between the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans, the first ship ever to have done so, has been considered a nautical 
miracle.  </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Golfers at the Dominion Country Club in Windsor, Ontario, in 1941, were afraid to 
touch anything in the clubhouse, just in case it caught fire.  Members claimed 
tablecloths, curtains and towels burst into flames for no apparent reason.  Flames 
jumped out of the telephone book when the manager tried to call the Fire Chief.  A 
sceptical insurance man, investigating the claims, visited the clubhouse, and a 
broom burst into flames in front of him.  Then, as suddenly as they had started, the 
mystery fires stopped.  There were 43 reported incidents and not one of them has 
been satisfactorily explained.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A beautiful old farmhouse in southern Ontario was everything the family had hoped 
for.  They moved in with their two large sheepdogs and everything was perfect, 
except for the back bedroom, which was always freezing cold, and had an eerie feel 
to it. The dogs refused to enter and growled, barked and put their ears back if they 
went anywhere near it.  Anyone who dared sleep in the room had nightmares 
about death.  Locals told them a woman had been murdered in the room by her 
jealous husband, before he slashed his wrists and bled to death on the floor.  The 
family solved the problem by converting the bedroom into a storage room.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Young Esther Cox, lived in Amherst, Nova Scotia in 1878, with seven other 
members of her family.  She was 18.  Some members of her family worked at the 
shoe factory and were friends with Bob McNeal, tall, handsome and regarded by 
local girls as a great catch.  When Esther went out with him one night in August 
1878, in a borrowed horse-drawn two-seater carriage, something unpleasant 
happened which ended with Bob threatening Esther with a gun.  He changed his 
mind, drove her home and dumped her at her gate, and then left Amherst and was 
never heard of in that area again. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Esther cried herself to sleep that night and every 
night for the next week, which kept her sister, Jean, awake every night.  One night  
Jean finally asked her sister to forget him and pull herself together.  This was the 
moment that the amazing events began, starting slowly at first, then building up as 
the force gathered power.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Esther stopped crying and sat up in bed with a shriek.  
Something was moving under her covers, like a mouse.  They both threw back the 
covers and searched, but no mouse was found.  Esther thought she had imagined 
it, but it happened again the following night.  Again, they searched but found 
nothing, but they could hear a rustling noise coming from under the bed.  Under 
the bed, Esther kept a box for storing pieces of cloth to be used for patchwork. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They dragged out the box into the centre of the room ready to catch the mouse.  
Without any warning, the box lifted itself into the air and then fell back to the 
floor, twice.  The girls screaming bought their uncle into the room, and, after 
hearing their story, emptied the box onto the floor.  There was nothing in there 
except material.  He said they'd had a nightmare and to go back to sleep.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The 
next night, Jean fetched her uncle to look at Esther who appeared to be ill.  She 
had swelled up like a balloon, with her eyes popping out and hair standing on end.</P> 
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some moments later, there was a loud 'pop', and she returned to her normal size. 
There was no explanation, but the family were getting worried.  Nothing happened 
for a fortnight, then Esther swelled up again. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When Jean summoned help, the 
bedclothes flew off Esther's bed into the corner of the room, her pillow hit a family 
member in the face, and thunder-like noises came from under the bed.  Esther then 
returned to normal and the noises stopped.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The next night, the doctor was called 
when Esther started to swell.  Before he had time to examine her, her pillow shot 
out from under her head, and then replaced itself.  When the pillow moved again, 
her uncle tried to prevent it returning under her head, only to have it wrenched out 
of his hands by tremendous force.  There was then a loud thunderclap and the 
bedclothes flew off the bed.  The doctor stood back, waiting to see what happened 
next, unable to believe what he was seeing.  There was a movement in the plaster 
behind Esther's bed.  Everyone drew back, alarmed, and then watched as letters 
began to form, as if being cut into the plaster by an invisible knife.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The message 
read: &nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=RED> ESTHER YOU ARE MINE TO KILL.. &nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Everyone left the room as fast as they 
could, except Esther, who seemed to be unconscious, and went outside.  As the 
doctor and the family discussed what was to be done, a piece of plaster broke away 
from the bedroom wall, flew through the air, turned a corner and landed at the 
doctor's feet, followed by pounding noises, shaking the bedroom and it's contents 
for two hours, before finally stopping.  The doctor decided to examine Esther in the 
morning, before he made a decision. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following morning, when the doctor returned, Esther was helping with the 
chores as if nothing had happened.  She complained only that sudden noises made 
her jumpy.  She also said that when she had been in the cellar earlier, something 
had thrown a plank of wood at her.  On investigation, the doctor was pelted with 
potatoes!  The doctor decided to sedate her before she went to bed that night, to 
eliminate the possibility that she herself was causing the strange disturbances. </P>
    
<P ALIGN="LEFT">When Esther finally fell asleep that night, after doctor had administered the 
sedative, the noises began again, even louder than before, then moved to the roof 
instead.  Outside it sounded like someone was hitting the roof with a 
sledgehammer, but there was no-one to be seen, and no damage inflicted.  He 
could still hear the banging as he walked home. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">At the end of the week, three 
ministers arrived to exorcise any ghosts or evil spirits which may be tormenting 
Esther, at the request of neighbours who had become increasingly concerned.  They 
failed to stop the strange occurrences.  Esther then caught diphtheria, and after 
treatment was sent to stay with a married sister, ten miles away in Sackville, to 
recover. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When she returned a few weeks later, she found that she and Jean had been moved 
to another room in the house, in the hope that what ever force there was, would 
not follow her.  Of course, it did. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The first night, lighted matches fell from the 
ceiling onto their bed, one by one, causing small fires which they both managed to 
extinguish.  By now, Jean was becoming suspicious - had Esther thrown the lit 
matches up to the ceiling herself?</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Three days later, while Esther was in the dining-
room, a fire started in the cellar, which the family managed to put out with buckets 
of water. Then the thunderclaps and other noises began again, with other fires 
which mysteriously started, over the next week.  A neighbour, John White, was 
sympathetic, and offered to have Esther stay in return to helping his wife with her 
housework. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Esther was sure that what force there was would not follow her there, 
but she was wrong.  Whilst working in the kitchen, a scrubbing brush flew out of 
her hand, then returned to strike her on her head.</P> 

   <P ALIGN="LEFT">John took her to work with 
him instead in his restaurant, but strange events happened there too.  Doors 
opened and shut on their own, furniture would move about, then knives started 
hurling themselves around.  On one occasion, a boy sitting at one of the tables was 
holding his penknife when it flew through the air, opened in mid-flight and stuck 
itself in Esther's back!</P> 

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Other people offered to help, and she moved extensively 
over the next few months, first to  St. John's, in New Brunswick, for three weeks, 
and then at a farm with the Van Ambergh family for eight weeks.  All was peaceful, 
both with Esther and her family. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, thinking it was all over, she returned to her family.  A few weeks later, they 
had a visitor, an actor named Walter Hubbell, who helped the family decide that if 
it all started again, and it was due to Esther, that they could make money by using 
Esther to perform her unusual performance to a paying audience.  And indeed, the 
strange occurrences started happening again. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Walter watched, and then hired a 
hall in the town, sold tickets and put Esther on the stage.  Unfortunately, Esther did 
not set out to make these happen, and on stage, failed miserably to impress.  The 
audience clamoured for their money back, and Walter left town, very hurriedly!  
Later, he went on to make money for himself writing a totally exaggerated book 
about Esther.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Esther moved again to escape the publicity, to another farm, not far 
from the Van Amberg's, but it was another total disaster.  Esther was accused of 
stealing belongings from the farmhouse, which were found in a barn, which burnt 
down mysteriously.  She was convicted of arson, and sentenced to four months.</P>  

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Shortly after release from prison, she married, and lived in Massachusetts.  Her 
troubles came to an end, and she was never bothered again by the strange forces, 
but she refused to talk about them in case they came back.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">She died in 1912.   An 
investigation was carried out in 1920, by Dr. Walter Price, who came to the 
conclusion that Esther may have had a split personality.  All her previous employers 
had found her to be respectable, reliable, hardworking and honest, but not very 
bright.  He believed that she may have helped out with the later happenings, but 
not the ones at the beginning.  A poltergiest, coming either from Esther, or her 
surroundings, was certainly present at the beginning, which no-one could stop.  The 
evidence is beyond dispute or understanding.</P></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1795, a 16 year old boy, Daniel McGinnis,  beached his canoe on Oak Island 
and went exploring.  He stumbled across a round dent in the ground.  At the edge 
of the dent stood an ancient oak tree, and one of its scarred branches looked as if 
it had been used as a pulley to bury treasure.  The boy fetched his friends and they 
started digging.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And so began a hunt for buried treasure which has been one of the most frustrating 
and yet fascinating mysteries of all time.  Despite extensive efforts from teams of 
hopefuls, no-one has yet reached any treasure, over two hundred years later.  The 
Money Pit, as it became known, has cost the lives of six and thousands of pounds, 
wasted in the pursuit of treasure, and the hunt still continues.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Daniel and his friends managed to dig down to 30ft with spades, and found 
nothing.  Later, in 1804, work began again.  Explorers dug down and discovered a 
mysterious stone at 90ft, but the pit is booby-trapped and water fills the pit.  The 
explorers have to admit defeat.  The stone which was unearthed had something 
written in code scratched onto the surface.  A professor cracked the code, which 
reads 'Forty feet below two million pounds are buried.' </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1849, work began again, but the pit floods again.  Treasure hunters are forced 
to stop digging, but they drilled down and hit layers of oak and metal.  They reach 
the conclusion that its two treasure chests filled with money, but are unable to dig 
them up.  The team return the following year, and tunnel over to retrieve the 
treasure hoard, but the booby-trap springs again.  The flood tunnel is discovered 
but the treasure seekers can't block it off.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1860 a new team digs more shafts to get access to the treasure but the bottom 
falls out of the pit, and the treasure drops further down.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Another group re-discovers the pit in 1897, but encounter yet another booby-trap, 
and the pit floods again.  They lose the treasure, but find an inscribed stone with 
the letters 'v.i.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The pit depth has now reached 150ft, and is abandoned.
Interest started again in 1930, when a new team find an underground stream.  
They think the treasure must lie at the bottom, but are disappointed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the 60s, bulldozers and cranes are called in, but fail to dig up any treasure.  
Four men die in the attempt.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A submarine camera showed up what looked like three chest and a severed hand in 
1970.  Divers were sent to investigate, but returned with nothing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A theory put forward in 1980 by Rupert Furneaux, a pit expert, is that the treasure 
was dug up by the man who put it there in the first place.  Rupert is certain that 
Sire Henry Clinton, who was in charge of the British Forces in American around 
1780, built the pit as a hiding place for war funds in his care, and recovered the 
money before returning to England. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Explorers are not convinced, however.  The 
idea that it was built by Captain Kidd and that the treasure is still there keeps the 
hunt going.  But according to Furneaux, Captain Kidd's days as a pirate were over 
by 1780 and claims the pit designer was too clever to have been a pirate, and Kidd 
would not have had the men or the time.  He believes the pit took 100 men and 
six months to build.  Only one thing is certain, whoever built the Money Pit, 
certainly had something to hide.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Chad had a lifelong dream to go deer hunting in Canada, so one weekend, he 
picked up a game licence, his shotgun, packed his rucksack and headed off toward 
the mountains.  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">He didn't have to wait too long before he spotted deer.  He picked out a fine 
specimen and lined up his shot through his sights.  The trees were not too dense, 
and he could see the stag easily in his sights.  He couldn't miss.  He took aim and 
gently squeezed the trigger.  The deer crashed to the ground under a tree, and the 
rest of the herd took flight.  Chad couldn't believe his luck - he'd got one with his 
first shot!  He set up his camera on a tripod to capture his triumph, then walked 
over to the prone stag and placed his gun between its giant antlers.  Then he put 
on his best pose and waited for the timer to click.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But - just as the timer activated the camera, the stag rose to it's feet and bolted 
into the trees with Chad's gun still resting on it's antlers! </P> 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Chad had got so excited when the stag went down, that he hadn't realised that he 
had missed it, and had shot a branch instead, which had crashed down on the 
stag's head and knocked it out!  </P>

for the whole drive home.  But at least his camera had taken a shot he'd never
