Greetings to one and all:<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I would first like to thank all of those that I had the chance to meet
in Sacramento. While a short trip it was indeed great fun and real
delight meeting with all of you and hearing not only the encouraging
words, but also sharing in your concerns, desires, and dreams. We are
looking forward to deliver on what we discussed with you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When we purchased Amiga from Gateway there were many out there who said
that we would fail. There were many out there who have worked against
our efforts, and others that have misrepresented fact and manipulated
privileged information in order to further their obviously self serving
goals. There have been those who have wronged us, and caused us damage.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But, guess what? We are still here! We are still delivering! We are
going to stay here! Amiga is about people, technology, excellence, we
are a most tenacious people, and we have the community to prove it. Has
it always gone according to plan? no. Have we made some adjustments to
the plan? yes. Are we delivering on the plan? yes. Will we allow others
to dictate our future? Absolutely not. Period..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Because of you, the Amiga dream lives, because of you, Amiga's are still
being used throughout the world performing amazing tasks and activities,
and because of you, we are still here and moving forward.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga is a giant resting for the day of the fight, and gaining strength
quietly, for, as we embark on this mission together, nothing will tear
us apart.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thank you once again for supporting us, and showing to the world that
what was begun in 1985 was truly only the beginning.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER><U>Amiga Club Members:</U></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I would also like to take a minute and say a special howdy to all of the
club members. It is really encouraging to see all of the activity and
input from you with regards to the shirt design and name for the club.
The "I am Amiga" name did not go over as well as I had thought, but in
the next couple of weeks (after we get the ok from those who already
have the name that was
selected) we will all have the name and shirt design with which an be
happy and proud to wear. Each member will receive their first newsletter
in the next two weeks, and there will be all sorts of great
announcements and information e, so look forward to it in your inbox.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As a reminder we will be having a new drawing for an Amiga Enabled Cell
Phone in September, and we would encourage those of you who have not
joined yet, to get in here and do so. We have many plans and activities
coming up for the club, and once again for only $ 50.00 you will receive
the newsletter, Shirt and other special promotions. The lifetime
membership offer has ended, but we would encourage you to be a part of
something really exciting as the members will continue to receive
special discounts and exclusive programs directed at the membership. We
will honor the "$50.00 off" certificate for the next members who join
through the end of September, at which point we will hold the draw for
the new cell phone.</P>

September 1st, 2002:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As mentioned in Sacramento at AmiWest, we had offered amnesty to those
people/companies/entities who have knowingly stolen our IP and used it
for their own gains, or who have shipped product knowing that they are
illegal had until the end of August in order for them to comply and to
get legal.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now, I am not going to mention names nor am I going to get into a public
discourse on what is happening.. But legal action has begun. In the next
two weeks papers will be served. We will target one violator at a time
with the hope that we will send a very clear signal that this is very
serious, will not be permitted and will be stopped.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is a private action between Amiga Inc, and those who wish to
continue in this practice. While we announced publicly our intentions,
the actions will be private. I am sure that everyone can understand this
and I hope will support this.</P>

AmigaOne Update:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, the amazing team of Eyetech and Hyperion are doing a great job.
Many of you already have in your possession the AmigaOne boards, and
many more of you have seen the hardware in action. This is indeed
another major leap forward as we near the release of the new hardware
and OS 4.0. Eyetech and Alan Redhouse have been doing a great job of
keeping everyone informed of the progress, and we look forward to the
products release.</P>

AmigaOS 4.0:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hyperion and the team are making amazing strides here. The screen shots
that we all see and the updates from Ben and the people working on it
shows great progress. I know that they are working hard with regard to
the integration into the AmigaOne, and I for one am looking forward to
seeing it all working together, and from what I hear we are not too far
off from making that happen. With this stated we have received some more
shots of the interface from the OS 4.0 team. You can see the new AmiDock
screenshots here.http://os.amiga.com/os4/OS4AmiDock.php</P>


PDA/Cell Phone Update:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As mentioned in Sacramento the Amiga Anywhere Content Engine and
associated content will be shipping on the new Sendo SmartPhone when
it ships. Now, to answer the many e-mails that I have received about the
Sendo phone©. I do not know when the device will ship commercially; it
is out of our hands with regard to when they will have the phone
available. I will tell you that before the end of the year we will be
making at least two more Cell Phone announcements and at least two more
PDA announcements.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We are really starting to move on getting these business deals done and
there will be many more opportunities for our developers to create new
products for these cutting edge devices.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A Possible New Product Offering - Let me know your thoughts:
In recent dealings with one of our hardware OEM's they offered an
opportunity. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This opportunity is for excellent laptop hardware at excellent prices.
They would be dual boot systems with Linux/UAE, and Bernie Meyers
product (formally known as Amithlon) pre-loaded on the device. Here is a
sample of some of the pricing that you could expect, all prices quoted
are in US$:</P>
<Pre>
IntelR 1.2GHz Celeron Processor         256MB RAM         15.0" TFT
Active
Matrix         20GB Hard Drive         DVD Drive         Linux/UAE Ami*
 
$999 
IntelR 1.6GHz PentiumR 4 Processor         256MB RAM         15.0" XGA
TFT
Active Matrix         20GB Hard Drive         DVD/CDRW Combo Drive     
Linux/UAE Ami*         $1579
IntelR 1.6GHz PentiumR 4 Processor         256MB RAM         SXGA TFT
Active
Matrix         30GB Hard Drive         DVD/CDRW Combo Drive     
Linux/UAE Ami*         $1679
</PRE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">These examples are notebook computers. There are other options
available, but I am trying to find out how many of you would be
interested in purchasing these through your local Amiga dealer. Let us
know by sending an e-mail to interested@amiga.com. There are also
desktops and other configurations but I think that a notebook Amiga
would be compelling. Let us know.</P>

The Product Formally Know as Amithlo*:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As mentioned before Bernie Meyers has a wonderful product, and we
expected it to be out by now. However there have been a couple of
delays, none of these are engineering driven, that has delayed the
release. I can tell you that the new product will be out very soon, and
will offer some new requested features, and from what I understand is
really going to knock your socks off. We will have an update concerning
the timing of this release and the new name very shortly. So contrary to
what you may have heard, it will be available soon.</P>

Developers:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This message is an update for you. You have created some of the greatest
content that the world has ever known. Your skill sets and your tenacity
have overwhelmed many, and everyday you become more and more important
to the future. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have been sitting on the sidelines I encourage you to jump in. We
are getting requests from many of our OEM partners with regard to
content that they are looking for on their devices.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">While it has been a slow start (as is always the case in developing a
market), this next quarter is going to see major movement, and
distribution. We have many programs ready to take place for the Holiday
season and we want you to be a part of it. So I encourage you to jump in
make contact with us. Join us in creating the future.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In closing I wish to thank each and every member of the Amiga family for
their support and good wishes in this amazing journey that we have
embarked upon together. We are closer today than we were yesterday to
the dreams and goals of Amiga. Tomorrow we will be closer again, and
soon we can all share in the rewards.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sincerely,</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team</P>
