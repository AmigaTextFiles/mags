<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well readers ... Welcome to another issue of "<FONT COLOR=RED>The <B>CRYPT</B> Magazine<FONT COLOR=AQUA>"
Doesn't time fly when you are enjoying yourself? Here we are at
Issue 25 a full two years since we re-introduced the<FONT COLOR=RED> <B>CRYPT</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> back to
it rightful place as a Magazine for Computer users.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We have lots of exciting articles to "<I>tickle your tastebuds</I>" in
this issue, However before describing some of these tasty treats,
A sad announcement<FONT COLOR=WHITE> :-</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT">Ray Hawkins<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (Founder of the CRYPT) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Dual editor and dear
friend, has decided, because of Personal commitments he can no
longer give the time required to continue in this particular post.
Therefore Ray has stepped down from Dual Editor and taken up a
position within Riyan Productions as a Staff Writer.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Rays Drive, Enthusiasm and commitment for the Magazine has been an
inspiration to us all, However we do understand his reasons, and
therefore must also accept his decisions in this matter. We of
course look forward to the odd article from the trusty,"<FONT COLOR=SILVER> Dungeon
Master</font>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> so his influence is not totally lost on the<FONT COLOR=RED> <B>CRYPT</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA>.</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Right what goodies do we have for you in this Issue?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"The DRUID Stones"</B> Read our article describing the Original
Druids, Were they a Mystical Cult offering Human sacrifices, or
simply a Religious order of bygone times ..You decide.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This issue we re-introduce a name that a lot of Amiga (<I>or Ex
Amiga</I>) users will surely be familiar with.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dr Martin Reddy ... Author of <B>"EDWORD PRO" </B>a powerful (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>even by
Todays standards<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) Text Editor for the AMIGA. Some good news for
those who have not tried Edword or those who may have tried the PD
Version ...EDWORD PRO (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>Full Version<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) is now available to download
<I>FREE</I> from Martins Website.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our own Mr Urie has excelled himself in this Issue, Not only has
he found a Rock Group that used the wonderful Amiga Program
"Lightwave" to Design their Album covers, He also succeeded in
getting us an Interview with Darrio Mollo<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <B>:)</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Continuing on the "Lightwave" theme, Check out the Superb examples
and Tutorials for this program on our featured website by Jack
Thewlis. Interested in Art work but can't afford (Or find)
Lightwave, Then read our Review of Drawstudio, Another excellent
Package for the Amiga.</P>

selections of Jokes and cartoons, A full taste of the Orient, Or
check out our "Steam Corner" Page for a taste of nostalgic
travelling.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes ..I believe that this issue has something for everyone. Work
has already started on our next Issue ...And I have a Good feeling
about this one. So see you all in Issue 26 Witches, Wizards &
Warlocks ...Oh and why not bring a friend or two on your next
