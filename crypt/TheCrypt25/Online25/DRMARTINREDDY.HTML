<CENTER><I>I am sure that the name</i> <B>"Martin Reddy" </B><i>will still ring a distant bell in the Heads of regular Amiga users. Martin was one of the 
More skilled Programmers on this platform, and although he has found a little recognition for his excellent Minesweeper game,
Most will remember him for his Excellent "<B>Shareware</B>" Text Editor ... </i><B>EdwordPro</B><i>. This excellent piece of Software, Was available to buy from F1 Software (Where did they disappear to?) and is my preferred editor used in the production of</i><FONT COLOR=RED> <B>The CRYPT</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER><i>. Martin has Now released the Last version of Edword as Freeware to the Amiga user, Downloadable from his excellent website</I>:-</font></font></CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spent many years doing various martial arts; principally WTF Taekwon-Do and Tukido. I hold a black belt (<B>1st Dan</B>) and four British Tukido Championships gold medals, as well as various regional titles.  When I can, I train at the Tang So Do club here at the SRI gym.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I've not done it for ages, I have always had a passion for flying and have gained my glider pilot's wings. The pinnacle so far has been to fly a Hunter fast jet down the valleys of Loch Ness, and to follow this up with some aeros pulling over 5G.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In the computing world, I have written various public domain and shareware programs. My major product has been the EdWord Professional text editor for the Amiga. I also wrote a little version of Mine Sweeper for the Amiga, and a 3D version for the SGI.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">As I have just mentioned, I am a Scotsman. Before I moved to California I lived in Edinburgh. This is a really beautiful city and there's lots going on there.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detime  is  a very simple little utility that I wrote  because  my
camera  keeps insisting on putting those annoying  time  and  date
stamps  over  the bottom-left corner of my photos.   This  utility
will  try  to  erase that timestamp in a scanned  version  of  the
photo.  It will try to locate all pixels in the timestamp and  set
these to the colour of the nearest non-timestamp pixel.</P>
