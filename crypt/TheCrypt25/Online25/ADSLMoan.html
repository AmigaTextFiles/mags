<p><span class=GramE>Another issue, another article.</span></p>
<p>Must be about time to see what BT <span class=GramE>have</span> been up to……….</p>
<p>Well, BT has been busy since last issue!</p>
<p>Nope, they haven’t upgraded any more exchanges to ADSL status……….come on, you 
  didn’t really expect them to, did you?</p>
<p>I mean, although they have boasted about enabling over 1100 exchanges, didn’t 
  you question how many they have enabled this year?</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, they were boasting of over a thousand last year……….doesn’t 
  take a mathematician to work out that their progress has ever so slightly fallen………</p>
<p>They have announced more initiatives, however.</p>
<p>Initiatives, nice word for not bringing <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>’s 
  exchanges up to the same standard uniformly.</p>
<p>Let’s remember that BT was the British owned telephone network that was sold 
  off to private investors ……….</p>
<p>Let’s also remember that BT had a telephone network that was the envy of the 
  World, and that everyone on a BT exchange could access the range of services 
  available………</p>
<p>How times have changed………</p>
<p>Now, all you need to do to be able to get the full range of BT services is 
  to stay next door to one of their bigger exchanges………or have cable installed 
  in the area you live in to get your exchange ADSL enabled.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me, <span class=GramE>lets</span> have a quick look at the surrounding 
  area I live in.</p>
<p>Troon got their exchange upgraded. Amazingly <span
class=GramE>enough ,</span> this happened after the cable company decided to install 
  in their area. The fact that Troon has the same population density as other 
  towns in the area that can’t get their exchanges upgraded is a coincidence, 
  nothing more……….</p>
<p>In fact, <st1:City><st1:place>Irvine</st1:place></st1:City> next door to them 
  can’t get their exchange upgraded………..<span class=GramE>its</span> only bigger 
  than Troon……go figure. Well, of course, <st1:City><st1:place>Irvine</st1:place></st1:City> 
  has had cable for a number of years, so they wouldn’t have dropped their existing 
  system for an ADSL enabled exchange.</p>
<p><span class=GramE>Lets</span> not lay all the blame on BT for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
  having one of the worst uptakes of broadband in the World. The other major Telco’s 
  in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> should 
  shoulder their share of the blame. </p>
<p>When BT was privatised, OFTEL was there to ensure that competition was strong 
  enough to survive. This has been the major failing all along. Competition has 
  not thrived. If it had, BT would have been forced to offer its services to everyone, 
  not just a favoured few.</p>
<p>There have been scare stories around for years that BT has blocked or put obstacles 
  in everyone’s way to prevent them losing their monopoly. OFTEL has, for the 
  most part, pooh poohed these stories. OFTEL has also recently <span class=GramE>came</span> 
  to the conclusion that BT’s network should not be taken off them and that they 
  shouldn’t be forced to offer the same services to everyone.</p>
<p>However, I digress. </p>
<p>BT is very slowly getting their broadband tracker to <span
class=GramE>work ,</span> it actually shows people have registered now!!!</p>
<p>In fact, I noticed that over 32000 people have registered to try and get broadband. 
</p>
<p>It’s a shocker that there are over 32000 folk that can’t get broadband, and 
  that BT have only just discovered it!!</p>
<p>The new BT initiatives are a Broadband bandwagon to help educate everyone that 
  broadband is a good thing. Actually making it available would be a better step 
  in the right direction, I feel.</p>
<p>They are also trialling a wireless set-up in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Wales</st1:place></st1:country-region>.  
  This isn’t a true broadband service at the <span
class=GramE>moment ,</span> but could be if the trial is successful. Answers on 
  a postcard if you know what results they are expecting.</p>
  <p>They have also announced that they will be starting a trial whereby they 
    don’t connect via fibre to their network backbone. This will cut the cost 
    dramatically of upgrading exchanges and means that they could enable any exchange 
    with as few as 16 users of the broadband service. Since they have said already 
    that they would only use one ISP for this and the ISP would cough up money 
    to help provide this, call me cynical, but I expect Btopenworld to suddenly 
    be able to put up money to help provide <span class=GramE>this ,</span> if 
    this trial is a success. This, of course, would mean that Btopenworld would 
    have a monopoly on any of these exchanges if the folk wanted broadband………..</p>
<p>As I said before, it means that they say they could upgrade exchanges for as 
  few as 16 people……..but don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>I had a quick phone call to their broadband service about this development, 
  but they hadn’t heard of it. They seemed genuinely astonished when I told them 
  it was on the BT website……</p>
<p>As for how well this new set-up will work, I’ve no idea. In the exchange area 
  I live in, BT states that there isn’t enough traffic to warrant upgrading. Every 
  night, regardless of which ISP I use, I can’t hold a connection between 8-9 
  <span class=GramE>p.m..</span> Now, how much better would the service be if 
  they did enable our exchange without installing any more resources…………..</p>
<p>The government is also going to do its part to help get broadband for everyone 
  by trying to leverage upgrades using their financial muscle such as schools, 
  libraries etc </p>
<p>So, broadband may be around the corner for everyone. Believe it if you like.</p>
<p>Another few items that caught my eye were the stories in the Register that 
  BT had sent a warning letter to an Irish broadband user stating that they thought 
  he was using a P2P system and that this would be in breach of their terms…………..</p>
<p>Again, BT has also stated that with their “no frills” broadband, you were limited 
  to 1 gig downloads per <span class=GramE>day,</span> again this was spotted 
  on the Register newspage.</p>
<p>BT has still not finished its satellite trial……..this is the one that costs 
  apprx. £400 to <span class=GramE>install,</span> runs at half the speed of ADSL 
  and doesn’t upload……….</p>
<p>Right, I’ve vented my spleen yet again.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above, things are moving at snail’s pace to actually 
  get the broadband available countrywide. BT has put initiatives forward to try 
  and drive the broadband market. I do, however, <span
class=GramE>feel,</span> that most people will not register for broadband until 
  it is available in their area and they can see what the cost will be.</p>
<p>Anything else would be like signing a blank cheque, and the vast majority will 
  not do that. If BT actually wants (as it says) to create a Broadband Britain, 
  it will need to convince people that it will provide broadband at a uniform 
  price if they register, and that this figure is eminently achievable. Some of 
  the recent figures given for exchanges before they will be considered for upgrading 
  are at the 750 mark. In a <span
class=GramE>population</span> of two thousand for some of these, is it any wonder 
  that folk won’t register?</p>
<p>Some folk have insisted that BT is doing this simply to stall upgrading exchanges. 
  I sincerely hope that this isn’t the <span
class=GramE>case,</span> I can’t believe that they would be this cynical.</p>
<p>However, their efforts so far, have been woeful and I also see that their service 
  has been slated as well for speed. The last results I <span
class=GramE>saw,</span> were that they 9<sup>th</sup> in the top 10 providers 
  for speed!!! This, in <span class=GramE>itself ,</span> is a shocking indictment 
  for Britain’s largest Telco.</p>
<p>My wish list  ( apart from getting my local exchange upgrade) is that  all 
  the telecomm providers in Britain actually do something about upgrading. There 
  are loads of Telco’s and so far, very few, apart from BT, have upgraded an exchange!!!!</p>
<p>I believe that BT should enable all exchanges, but a little help from the others 
  wouldn’t go amiss.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m off now to investigate a satellite broadband system that they were 
  talking about on the ADSLguide website. Seems it isn’t all that expensive and 
  although only one way, can be installed by anyone with a reasonable amount of 
  effort and the (Italian ) company providing the service only charges about £22 
  a month………..</p>
<p>You never know, maybe in a couple of issues time, I might just be writing about 
  that……………..</p>
<p>Ciou!!!</p>
