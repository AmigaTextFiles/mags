Rink</font></strong></h1></center>

<p align="center">Reproduced with the kind permission of Natalie Murphy</p>
<br>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">For some years, my only sporting
interest has been Ice Hockey. Apart from ice skating in general, ice hockey has been a
constant source of entertainment, social interaction and `the game`.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">No other sport provides the
exhilarating feeling that ice hockey can. It is the fastest team sport in the world and if
hit efficiently, the puck can reach speeds of 120 mph plus.<br>
The atmosphere at hockey matches crackle with anticipation until&nbsp; the teams reach the
`ice`, then the frenzied expression of the eager supporters are vented to the full. The
players are the heroes, the carriers of all the emotion, the hopes, the dreams of their
audience. The game is a naturally aggressive one, with players fighting for possession of
the rubber disc that could propel them into the status of a superstar, or send them to the
`sin bin` for any misappropriation of the rules. The aggression with which the game is
played does not spill out into the supporters however, unlike other team sports such as
football. A hockey game is a family sport where the mix of supporters include people of
all ages, children and adults alike.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">THE SOUTHAMPTON VIKINGS</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I live in the City Of Southampton,
England. Southampton is an average sized city with approximately 260,000 citizens. We have
not enjoyed the facility of an ice rink and the&nbsp; sport of ice hockey for some
time now, but for over 50 years before that fateful day&nbsp; in August 1988, when the rink was finally
closed for good, Southampton could boast one of the best hockey clubs and ice rinks in the
country.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">It all started in 1931, when the first
ice rink opened it's doors to the general public. It was July 18th and the rink offered
general skating sessions and public entertainment of barrel jumping, ice dancing, and
later ice speed skating. Ice Hockey was between local `town` sides, from the suburbs in an
in-house league system. The first proper game of ice hockey was in November of that year,
when the rink hosted a match between Great Britain and Germany. It was simply a taster of
the of the times to come. The first competitive match for Southampton Ice Hockey Club was
against Bournemouth on 22nd November 1931. It would be another five years before the
Vikings would come into being. Before this however, the club would play in the National
League, in which they drew their first match 3-3, with the London Lions.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">After the success of the Great Britain
team in the 1936 Olympics, ice hockey was the sport everyone wanted to see. Southampton's
chance came when a Paris based club collapsed with huge debts because of the high cost of
imported players and the constant travelling from France to England. What remained of the
&quot;Club Francais Volants&quot; became The Southampton Vikings. Most of the players were
of&nbsp; French Canadian blood except two. One was the Great Britain net minder, Art
Child, and the other was Frankie Green who came from Ireland. The team name,
Vikings, came about because the players kit used still had the V logo used by
the French club. So it was decided that the easiest and most economical thing to
do was to call the club something beginning with V. So the Vikings were born.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The first match that Southampton
Vikings played at the Southampton Ice Rink and Sports Centre&nbsp; was a total sell out.
Extra seating had to be erected, such was the demand and 3,000 people managed to cram in
what was then a large arena to see the Vikings beat The London All Stars 10-5. But it was
not to last long, the same reason that brought the French club down also defeated the
newly formed Vikings, and after only one season, the club folded. Southampton continued
with their love of ice hockey however, and before long had formed The Southampton
Amateurs, a mix of nationals and imports, much the same as the set up now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1939,&nbsp; Charlie Knott, a local
business man purchased the Southampton Ice Rink. He had an big interest in ice hockey and
financed the setting up of a brand new team structure. The Southampton Imperials played
their first match in the London Provincial League. In 1940 after the out break of war, the
Nazi's managed to put an end to the ice rink when a parachute mine landed, and the rink
took a direct hit. This stopped any chance of ice hockey until after the hostilities
ceased, although it was not until 1952 that any semblance of organised ice hockey would be
seen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" Images/bomb.jpg" width="353" height="267" src="Images/bomb.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">The total destruction of the
first ice rink in 1940</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Charlie Knott, vowed to build a new
rink &nbsp; for the citizens of Southampton, and he purchased an ice plant from Purley Ice
rink and a steel building structure from the Supermarine works. (The Supermarine works was
the factory where all of the Spitfire warplanes were conceived and built during the
Second World War). After obtaining planning permission and a building licence, with the support from the local
Members of Parliament,&nbsp; the work started and the phoenix arose literally from the
ashes of the old rink. The second Southampton Sportsdrome was born and It opened on March
27 1952,</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/icer.jpg" alt="The Sportsdrome just after completion" width="359" height="281"></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">The rink pictured here as it
originally looked before the complete refurbishment by Rank in 1963</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/inside1.jpg" alt="Oh, what a rink that was!!" width="494" height="358"></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">The rink looking from the bowling alley
end. The balcony is to the left.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Southampton were at last a
happy hockey town again. Mr. Knott then contacted&nbsp; Benny Green who ran an
ice hockey club in Brighton. He was given permission to approach some of the
British players. This was the start of a new team and the renaissance of the
club that everyone in Southampton knew and loved, The Vikings. By the start of
the new season in 1952, the mighty Southampton Vikings took to the ice once
again. The first game was against the Wembly Terriers in which the score ended a
3-3 draw. No mean feat and that was just the start of the Southampton club's
success. In their first season, they won the Southern Intermediate League, and
at the same time set a new record for scoring the most goals. Throughout the
fifties and early sixties the club went from strength to strength winning the
British Ice Hockey Association Cup no less than five times. The rink would be
busting at the seams as the Vikings continued their upward spiral. If you wanted
a seat, you had to book early or be disappointed.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The land on which the Southampton rink
was built on also contained a motor cycle speedway, dog track and&nbsp; a roller
rink. In 1963,The Rank Organisation
approached Charlie Knott with the intention of buying the whole site and an offer was made and
subsequently accepted. Rank's original plans were to retain the land for building
houses after
closing the facilities but Knott refused to sell under these circumstances. Rank then
backed off and agreed to run the ice rink and bowling alley, but there long term ambition would
remain to sell the land on to a developer. As it was, a large parcel of the land
was sold almost immediately and luxury houses were built. The town council
honoured Mr Knott by naming one of the new residential roads as Charles Knott
Gardens.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;At
first the plans for the site sounded interesting and an improvement. A bigger rink would
be just what was required if the Vikings were to continue to build on their astounding
success. A refurbished ice rink and bowling alley would be constructed and opposite this,
a new dance hall was to be built on the site of the old speedway. There were
also plans to build a conference hall and hotel complex but the land for this
was never used or developed to its full potential. The most important&nbsp; part that was to be left
out was ice hockey!!. The `refurbished` ice rink had a reduced sized ice pad, no boards and no ice
hockey. One end of the ice pad was turned into a 'mini rink' where new skaters
could practice. It was totally segregated from the main rink and was a disaster
as the ice would melt so quickly. Experienced skaters would not use it as the
concrete showed through in places. (It was later turned into a cafe when hockey
was reintroduced.). Even hockey skates were banned in favour of figure only skates; trade plummeted.
Who wanted an ice rink where all you could do was skate around in a circle? Southampton
was a hockey town, generations had enjoyed the sport and it was gone because `Top Rank`,
the leisure arm of the Rank Organisation, saw the investment as a Leisure Centre. The
trade was mostly at the dance hall, after all It was the mid sixties when the world was driven by
`pop music`. The success of that part of the operation supported the failing ice rink and
bowling alley.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/balc.jpg" alt="There's me, 15th from the left" width="324" height="230"></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">This feature of a balcony was
also not in the refurbished rink, although it was never completely taken out. It
was boxed in behind a false wall and many could not understand why.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1967, 3 years after the disastrous
refurbishment, a group of skaters which included the author, approached the manager, John
Tennent, and suggested that the use of hockey skates should be introduced. We also had the
backing of some of the staff to help us in our bid to try and return the rink into
something the public wanted. After some negotiation, the manager approached his
organisation and convinced them that it would help trade increase and they agreed. There
was a distinct shortage of hockey skates to be had, everyone wanted them. Unless of course
you had a pair hanging in the cupboard gathering dust...............</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">On the ice hockey front, most of the
old players were still playing at Bristol ice rink, calling themselves the Southampton
Redwings. This continued under the leadership of Ray Hammond. It would be his players that
brought back quality hockey to a starved Southampton a few years later.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The changes at the leisure site
continued. The bowling alley was shut because of the lack of trade. The same group of
skaters who managed to get the hockey skates brought back, went further and had organised
speed skating re-introduced too. The old speeders, Norman (Knocker) Knight, (who
cut the end of my finger off in a practice session), Ron Gover and his son
Paul&nbsp; as well as a Graham and a John, me, Jim Cambell, Dave Armstrong and
of course, speedy himself Glynn Davies were part of the new speed club The rink started to fill up again with happier
customers and a lot of the old skaters started to return, knowing at least they could skate in their
chosen skates and enjoy something of the old days. The rink was dangerous, there was no
doubt about that,&nbsp; the rink was of a non-standard size, and there was
no barrier to stop a speed skater from ending up in the tables and chairs that were placed
around the edge of the ice pad. There were some nasty accidents, but with the lack of a proper barrier, it
was accepted that some injury would occur. Speed skating matches were held with teams from all over the
country and Southampton often won the match because the conditions made the
visiting teams wary and more cautious.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">By the early seventies, the Rank
Organisation were beginning to show their real reason for purchasing the Ice Rink. The
land. They submitted plans to the City Council for luxury housing and it was turned down.
The organisation would continue to pursue this plan throughout the life of the rink as it
seemed to be plan `A` to start with. The rink was beginning to lose some of it's appeal.
The older skaters were drifting away, the younger skaters wanting more from the management
but not getting it. Disillusionment started to creep in and the management started to look
at ways to improve the trade. Ice hockey was the obvious answer, but the rink was not able
to host any matches as there were no boards to protect the spectators and players alike.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Pete Cutler who was a regular supporter adds,
&quot;In an attempt to reinstate ice hockey in Southampton, four (I think) games</font>
<font face="Arial" size="3">were arranged in the early seventies. Before each
game a scaffold barrier</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">was erected all the
way around the rink and covered with tarpaulin and</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">removed
afterwards (can you imagine that happening these days?). I used to</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">help
with this when I was a teenager and Pete Murray would give us tickets for the
next game.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">The team playing was the
Southampton Redwings</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Pete Lane, Pete Murray,
Tony Highmore, Bob Turnbull, Alan Hindmarch, Ken</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Flood,
Barry Smith plus a few others that have escaped me. This team later</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">went
on to play from Bristol as the Bristol Redwings before returning as the</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Southampton
Vikings.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Three of the games&nbsp; were
against Wembley Lions, Brighton</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Tigers and
the Solihull Vikings. I think the last game was against either</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">Birmingham
Barons or more likely Altrincham Aces.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">There would have to be a significant change to the rink,
the hockey proved such a success that&nbsp; at last the management
of&nbsp; Top Rank agreed to its re-introduction. The rink was closed in the
summer of 1976 to have a new ice surface installed and permanent boards erected around the edge of
the pad.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">12 long years had gone by since ice
hockey had been stopped, and now it was coming back. Supporters from near and far flocked
to see the resurgence of ice hockey in the city. Once again the rink was packed to the
limit with happy hockey nuts. &quot;We're back and we are going to stay this time.&quot;
The following twelve years saw the Southampton Vikings win and lose in several different
ways.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">On the 25th September 1976, the
Vikings stepped onto the ice to rapturous applause from the eager supporters. The rink was
a sad reflection of the one Charlie Knott had sold Top Rank 13 years earlier. This didn't
stop the supporters from enjoying every minute of the game with an all star select team
from the rest of the Southern Region. It was a glorious night for all, but trouble was
brewing in a back room at the Rank Organisation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">As the seasons passed, the Vikings
went from strength to strength. The 1976 season ended with a runners up place in the
league, and the `Icy Smith Cup`; only the Fife Flyers went one better than the Vikings in
the two leg final. In 1978 the Southampton Vikings almost tasted the top, but were beaten
into second again by the Solihull Barons. The seasons ticked by and by 1982 the club were
never out of the top three. It was about this time that a new company appeared on the
scene. Mecca leisure bought the whole site from The Rank Organisation. Some changes were
made to the structure of the rink, but the reputation Mecca brought with them did
not
bode well for the future.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">It wasn't until the 1983/4 season that
the hard work and tenacity paid off, and the Vikings got what they had always wanted, the
top of British League Division One, and promotion to the Premier Division. The new season
of 1984/5 started with so much anticipation and hope. This is what all of the effort had
been for, to bring Premier League hockey to Southampton. It was a dreadful year. Through
the lack of experience and injuries, the mighty Vikings were beaten out of sight. The
bigger clubs proved too much, and one opposing supporter was heard to say, &quot;You'll
have to better than this, your playing with the big boys now.&quot; The Southampton
Vikings returned to the First Division, their morale in tatters, but not their resolve.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">1985/6 was one of no great successes
or failure, but with new management in place and a will to succeed, the Vikings once again
started to make some progress towards that never ending goal of Premier league
hockey.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">In November 1986, Grand Metropolitan
plc who owned Mecca Leisure sold the company to the managers in a management buy
out. Grand Met. were unloading some of the less profitable assets and trying to
concentrate their business in other areas. Some assets of Mecca Leisure were sold
immediately to the Rank Organisation who were interested in the Bingo Hall
division, and these included all of the dance halls and ice
rinks! Those&nbsp; who knew the Southampton ice rink and what it had been like under rank management
before were frankly, worried. The last time, Rank had little interest in the rink, and it
was feared that the same would happen again. Strangely, there was no attempt at changing
the identification of the rink to reflect new ownership, but plans too dark to write about
here were underway.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The start of the new season of 1986/7
saw a new import player and an improved chance of success with the appointment of a new
coach, Kevin Murphy. Kevin an ex-Ayr Bruin player had returned to his home country of
Canada and he agreed to return to coach the Vikings. He was a hard task master and put the
players through hell and back, they needed this to get some sort of discipline back and to
boost morale as the results started to show the effort was worth it. As the season
progressed, the two popular imports were replaced. The reason given was that the club
needed to be sure that they were as strong up front as possible if a push towards the
Premier was to become reality. The supporters were not exactly happy with this state of
affairs, but after a time the imports showed their worth. Of course, it was the coaches
choice and who would argue with Kevin Murphy? The season ended with the best league
position since 1983/4 and the Vikings were looking forward to being back in the big time
soon.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The 1987/88 campaign got under way
with more new and better imports. The season started well, but there were black clouds on
the horizon for the club. Part of the way through the season, Kevin Murphy who had been
having discussions with the management concerning his contract, failed to come to an
agreement and left. The Vikings were plunged into crisis which did nothing for their
morale. Brett Kelleher, one of the import players was hastily promoted to player/coach.
Joe Vrtik was brought in to lend a hand. Joe was a personable player and the supporters
were astounded with the power that he was able to put behind the stick. Net
minders' felt
that power as they tried to stop the missiles as they landed. On of Joe's efforts, went
straight through the side netting surrounding the playing area and hit one of the
supporters! The Vikings also managed to enter the record books too. At the seasons end,
they attempted to set a new record for the longest hockey match. They played for twenty
four hours using all of the players that was possible and went into the record books. It
was also for a charity event, the ITV Telethon appeal and all cash raised went to it. We
all looked forward to the new season as that one, the club, players and supporters would
not willingly look back on. What was to come however, was far worse than even the most
informed of us could imagine.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">During the summer of 1988, extensive
rebuilding of changing facilities was achieved along with a new press box, toilets and a
new suspended ceiling, all paid for and built by the parents of the Southampton Redwings
under fourteen hockey club. A local plumbing company had supplied and installed a new
heating system free of charge and new security barriers were also added. The supporters
were looking forward to the start of the new season and hopes were high of improving the
Vikings league position compared to the previous season. New imports were lined up to
arrive from Canada and then the second bombshell hit the rink. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">CLOSURE</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">In early August, a week before the
season started properly, Mecca Leisure, the supposed owners, announced that the rink was
closed for structural repairs. What was happening in reality was the rink was being
stripped from the inside. A few days after this announcement, Mecca said that the rink was
closed for good and would be demolished. They were going to apply for planning permission
to build `luxury homes` on the site and a developer was waiting to begin work immediately.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">There was outrage at the sneaky way
Mecca had announced the closure and the way the inside was being stripped <u>before</u>
the final announcement. The Redwings club were even more outraged as when the parents went
to the rink to salvage what they could of the hard work they had put in during the summer,
all they found was an empty shell. Everyone in Southampton could not believe that the ice
rink was closed for good. A petition was set up to protest at the treatment by Mecca
Leisure and protest marches were organised. The City Council said that the site would
never be used for luxury homes as it was a leisure site and would remain so. Appeals went
out to try and stop the closure but all to no avail. Rank were adamant that it was the
only solution to the problem, the rink would have to close.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The City Council showed support but
stopped short of using tax payers money for new facilities. They invited applications from
developers and Councillor Alan Whitehead told an ice rink supporters meeting at the
Mayflower Theatre, (previously known as The Gaumont), that the council intended to erect a
temporary rink within nine months and a brand new state of the art Ice rink within three
years. This was a cynical attempt at appeasing the skating fraternity, in all places, the
theatre which may have been part of the deal with Rank that caused the closure
of the rink in the
first place.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">There was more to the closure of the
rink than meets the eye as the reports about it centered on Mecca Leisure being the
protagonists and not Rank. The reason for this is cloaked in secrecy and it is only
hypothesis at the moment which could explain the sudden closure. At the time Rank came
back into ownership of the ice rink site two years before, they were in negotiation with
the city council over a theatre that the leisure giant wished to turn into a bingo hall.
The council had stubbornly refused to allow them over the years to alter the use of the
theatre and now were offering to buy the building themselves in order to save
it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"> The Rank
management consistently refused to sell the theatre; were they holding on to a
valuable bargaining chip?&nbsp; Why had they suddenly relented and
changed their minds?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Rank agreed to sell the Gaumont
Theatre to the council, but on what terms? Could it be that Rank used the
theatre as a
lever against the council to get an agreement from them to close the ice rink and develop
the land for housing in return for allowing the city the pleasure of retaining the
theatre? After years of attempting to change the theatre into a bingo hall, and within
days of coming into&nbsp; unwanted ownership of the ice rink site, everything changed. The
truth is out there, somewhere.</font></p>
