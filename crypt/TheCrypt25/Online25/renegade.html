  I`ve loved playing games from Westwood ever since they made one of my all time 
  favourites "Dune" for the Amiga. And Renegade has a lot of similarities to Dune, 
  in that you have two armies fighting each other for dominance, with the basic 
  game play of attacking your opponent whilst defending your own base. There is 
  a harvester in both games, a refinery, power plant and weapons factory. But 
  the big difference with Renegade is you play as one of the soldiers on the ground, 
  whilst Dune is played as a "God game" where you send your troops off to fight 
  but have no control as to how they fight.<br>

  I play Renegade on a 1ghz Athlon with 524mb of memory, a Radeon 32mb All-in-Wonder 
  graphics card and a BT Broadband connection. But I still find it slows down 
  sometimes during heavy fighting, so I would recommend at least the same specs 
  to play this game. As with all online games, if your on Broadband you have a 
  distinct advantage over your opponent who is on a normal modem because you can 
  snipe him before he knows what hit him, very satisfying! <br>

"Command & Conquer: Renegade is a fast-paced 3D action game set in the gripping Command & Conquer universe. For the first time, experience the Command and Conquer universe up-close and personal as you fight it out on the ground among the structures, vehicles and weapons made famous in the original game. You assume the role of Havoc, elite GDI commando who fights and explores from a first or third-person viewpoint. Battling through exotic indoor and outdoor environments, you’re free to use both brute force and stealth in your mission objectives against the evil Brotherhood of Nod."<br><br>

  My personal favourite part of the game is the multiplayer section, where you 
  can choose to be a stealth NOD soldier sneaking up on your opponent invisibly 
  and sniping him from a distance, or a more conventional GDI soldier with long 
  range rockets and my personal favourite strategy of "I`ve got a big tank and 
  I`m coming through whether you like it or not." <br><br>

So is the game worth £30? <br>
  I would say a resounding Yes! The first player part of the game starts off at 
  the right level of difficulty, so by the time you`ve finished the whole of the 
  game you need to be an expert, some games I`ve tried expect you start in expert 
  mode from the beginning.<br>
The attention to detail is excellent, and the sound quality is very good. Take all that and the fact that in multiplayer mode the fun really begins, makes this one of my all time favourites.<br>
