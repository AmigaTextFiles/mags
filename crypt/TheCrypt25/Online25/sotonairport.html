<P><B><U>1910</U> </B>The distinction of being 'the founder' of
Southampton Airport falls to Eric Rowland Moon who periodically used
the meadows of North Stoneham Farm to fly his homemade monoplane,
Moonbeam Mk II.</P>

<P><B><U>1917</U></B> Stoneham Farm was requisitioned by the War
Office to build an Aircraft Acceptance Park, but before it was
completed the base was given to the US Navy to develop an assembly
area for future bombing operations in Northern Europe.</P>

<P><B><U>1921</U></B> A number of shipping companies moved in and
used the facilities as a trans-migrant centre. Renamed Atlantic Park
Hostel, flying activities at the airfield were curtailed until the
end of the 1920s.</P>

<P><B><U>1932</U> </B>Southampton Corporation purchased Atlantic Park
and the airfield became Southampton Municipal Airport.</P>

<P><B><U>1936</U> </B>On 5 March Captain Joseph 'Mutt' Summers, chief
test pilot with Vickers Supermarine Ltd, took the prototype of the
Spitfire K5054, out on its maiden flight. The Spitfire, designed by
legendary designer Reginald Joseph ('RJ') Mitchell, was a winner and
soon went into full production. They were designed and built locally
in Woolston and were then assembled and tested at Southampton
Airport.</P>

<P><B><U>1939</U> </B>RAF Southampton was recommissioned as HMS Raven
and subsequently spent most of the war in a ground and air training
role for the Royal Navy. In an attempt to disrupt the assembly of
aircraft, sporadic raids were made on the airport. However German
propaganda did not quite get it right when they reported that HMS
Raven had been sunk!</P>

<P><B><U>1945</U> </B>Resumption of a regular air service to the
Channel Islands marked the return of the war-time aerodrome to a
municipal airport, subsequently nationalised in 1948.</P>

<P><B><U>1960s</U> </B>Mr. J. N. Somers, owner at the time of a small
airfield in Hertfordshire, secured the future of Southampton Airport
when he purchased it from Southampton Corporation.</P>

<P>A number of airport improvements including the construction of a
1723m concrete runway were carried out, as routes and frequency of
flights increased.</P>

<P>In the first year of operation with the new runway, 273,247
passengers passed through the airport, almost four times the figure
for the previous year.</P>

<P><B><U>1970s</U></B> The recession led to a reduction in passenger
numbers, but undeterred, a new air traffic control tower was built
and AR1 Surveillance Radar installed.</P>

<P><B><U>1984</U></B> Airports UK Ltd, a wholly subsidary of
BAA&nbsp;plc, was appointed to manage the operational activities of
Southampton Airport and set about improving the facilities and
attracting new services.</P>

  <P><B><U>1988</U></B> A consortium headed by Peter de Savary bought
the airport site from Mr. Somers and applied for planning permission
for the complete redevelopment of the airport as well as the
construction of two business parks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P><B><U>1990</U></B> BAA plc purchased the site apart from the
proposed business parks and announced its intentions to invest
&#163;27 million in the complete redevelopment of the airport.</P>

<P><B><U>1993</U></B> Detailed planning permission was granted and
work began on the construction of the new facilities.</P>

<P><B><U>1994</U></B> The 'New Southampton Airport' was opened by HRH
the Duke of York.</P>

<P><B><U>1996</U></B> Over 560,000 passengers pass through the
Airport. A new record.</P>

<P><B><U>1997</U></B> 631,000 passengers travelled through the
airport as new destinations and modern aircraft were added to
Southampton's growing route network.</P>

<P><B><U>2001</U></B> Construction of a multi-storey car park begins
on two thirds of the existing short term car park.</P>

<B>This aerial photo was taken on 7th July 1981, not one of the
buildings in the picture survives today. It was before the M27 was
completed and shows the twisting railway bridge, which survivies, but
without the large roundabout which connects with the motorway
junction today.</B>
