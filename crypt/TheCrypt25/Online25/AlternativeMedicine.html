<CENTER>In june of last year my wife passed away, I felt so low, that I thought I
would die,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Life seemed such a mess that all I could do was to cry & cry.</CENTER>
<CENTER>At last I got myself together, and partly out of depression,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I felt at one time as though Dr Jekyll (that`s me) had back his old agression.</CENTER>

<BR>

<CENTER>Then in about Sept of last year, I met a 21 year-old black South African girl,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who gave me so much joy and love, yep, she made my heart and head swirl.</CENTER>
<CENTER>6 months of sheer fun, happiness lust & passion,</CENTER>
<CENTER>After 17 years of marriage I thought that fun had come back into fashion.</CENTER>
<BR>


<CENTER>But again, that relationship turned bitter and very sour,</CENTER>
<CENTER>She started a new job, made new friends, ok, no, they were a bad shower.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Clara was my girlfriends name, young sexy, beautifull, in fact my dream come true,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Ah, and the plans I had suddenly turned so sour, and I was left feeling so blue.</CENTER>
<BR>


<CENTER>She put her mates first, I became her `Sexy daddy or her bit on the side`,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I soon found out that she had another fella, so to me, she cheated & lied.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Ok, so if you get down reading this poem, I`m sorry,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Please don`t do what I felt like doing and throw yourself under a lorry.</CENTER>
<BR>


<CENTER>Instead, have good m8`s like those in this mag, who piss-take and have a crack,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But like some friends by your side, these won`t stab you in the back.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The folks who have been with TC the longest are a great bunch to know,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And when I resigned last year, my head was gone, but I didn`t want to go.</CENTER>
<BR>


<CENTER>So, when your feeling low, rejected, depressed, just go online and read TC,</CENTER>
<CENTER>After a while of reading it, hopefully you`ll feel better, just wait and see.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The Crypt should be classed as alternative medicine, by your GP,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Because if you don`t get cured, a big padded room will you see.</CENTER>

<CENTER>I`ve had plenty of medication, but I`m a lost cause I think,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Over the edge I almost went, I was that close to the brink.</CENTER>
<CENTER>TC is looking so good from my first days when I helped create it,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But there`s always those who knock it, god, they really get on my tit.</CENTER>
<BR>


<CENTER>Keep up the good work folks, as part founder I`m really proud of one & all,</CENTER>
<CENTER>On the net, yep, we can say `The Crypt` really walks very tall.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I told you that this poem wasn`t a tale of trouble & woe,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But sorry folks, it`s time for this old chap to hightail it and go....</CENTER>
