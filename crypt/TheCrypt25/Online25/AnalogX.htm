<p>This issue, I went to <a href="http://www.analogx.com/">http://www.analogx.com</a></p>
<p>In case you didn’t know, this is a small nest of very useful utilities.</p>
<p>I shall show you a couple and let you decide for yourselves.</p>
<p>First up is MaxMem. This is a small exe file that is for download from the 
  site and claims to free up memory. We all need more memory and systems always 
  benefit from lots of ram, so I downloaded this one.</p>
<p>The download is a prohibitive  136kb. Yup, a whole 136kb…………should take up 
  a lot of your bandwidth getting this.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=362 height=157

<p>It installs with no problems at all, that I could discern and asks you to register 
  the proggy. Registration is free, I should have mentioned, as is everything 
  on the site.</p>
<p>Once installed and activated (why not put it in the startup list), you get 
  a dinky little icon in your system tray.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=388 height=145
src="Images/analog002.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>That’s the little devil fifth from the left………..</p>
<p>Hover your mouse over it and , voila, you get a reading of the free memory 
  on your system.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=279 height=47
src="Images/analog003.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></p>
<p>You might also notice the small explosion next to the clock on the system tray. 
  Don’t worry about this just now, I’ll explain about that one later.</p>
<p>Right clicking on the icon gives the following……..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=336 height=162
src="Images/analog004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Not a lot to worry about, the first item gives the info box which is the first 
  grab.</p>
<p>Config gives the following………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=369 height=197
src="Images/analog005.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>This is where the action occurs. Here is where you set the memory limits that 
  MaxMem will abide by.</p>
<p>I’ve left these at the defaults but you can play with them to your hearts content.</p>
<p>MaxMem comes with a small readme………for the filesize, you wouldn’t expect a 
  full manual would you?</p>
<p>You can set what you want the proggy to do on a left click, be brave and tell 
  it you want an aggressive cleanup. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=300 height=155
src="Images/analog006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>Right, I suppose you want to know how well it does?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve had great results. A lot of programs leave memory fragmented and 
  this cleans it wonderfully and reclaims it!</p>
<p>As you can see above , at the time I took the grab I had 86mb free. After performing 
  a left click on the icon………….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=253 height=42
src="Images/analog007.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>Now that was easy. I’m very impressed with this very small utility. You just 
  never know when you will need to free up memory and its so simple as to be ludicrous. 
  Highly recommended!!!!! </p>
<p>Right, onward to the exploding icon…………</p>
<p>Another small utility I picked up while I was on the Analogx site was Capture.</p>
<p>Again, this is an extremely small file . This time the filesize is 215kb. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=360 height=155
src="Images/analog008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>Installation is the same as before……..totally painless!</p>
<p>Once loaded, again I recommend simply putting it in the startup drawer, you 
  get yet another icon on your system tray.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=247 height=36
src="Images/analog009.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>Yup, the little camera. All is now explained, I took the grabs using this little 
  capture proggy for this article and used Irfanview to crop them them and save 
  them as jpegs. Capture saves the grabs as bmp, which results is files a few 
  meg in size. When you take a grab, the icon shows as a flash to let you know 
  you’ve taken the grab.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=236 height=136
src="Images/analog010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>You can grab by using a right click of the icon as shown……or using configure……</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=467 height=171
src="Images/analog012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>As you can see , you can also use a hotkey, in this case I used F1, which isn’t 
  so clever an idea, knowing that your help system is tied up with it. You can 
  also simply save to the clipboard. </p>
<p>Again, a very simple interface that works well. </p>
<p>Yet again, another program that is useful and very easy to use. Download both 
  of these and give them a try……..for the filesize alone, you’ve nothing to lose!!!!!</p>
<p>Besides, these are just to whet your appetite, there’s lots more on the site……..go 
  gettim!!</p>
