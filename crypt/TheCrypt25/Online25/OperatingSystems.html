<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  last three OSes on the list are qualitatively different  from
the  rest they are designed as emulators or virtual machines  that
can  run  more  than  one OS at a time,   shared  in  one  set  of
hardware.   Like  the  story about  the  dancing  bear,   what  is
remarkable  given  the ancient x86 design is  not  how  well  they
work, but that they work at all.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Be  aware  that this short list is by no means exhaustive.   There
are  several more commercial or open OSes that are mature  and  in
use, but even this list will be enough to digest at one time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the interest of full disclosure,  I have used Microsoft Windows
from  1.01 in 1985 to Windows 3.1,  and subsequently Windows 95/98
and  NT.   In  the '87' 89 timeframe,  I ran DesQview and  Windows
together.  From the 1991 beta of OS/2 2.0 up to today's  eCS  1.0,
and  including  all versions between,  OS/2 has  been  my  primary
desktop.  In addition, I currently run NT, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD as
well as the occasional Linux. The Development of OS/2</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">People  new  to  computers in the '90s probably  don't  know  this
background,   and some may have forgotten.  Microsoft  was  OS/2's
chief competitor in the '90s,  but it didn't start that way.   Way
back  in  the  '86'87  timeframe,  OS/2 was a cooperative  effort
between  Microsoft  and   IBM.    Yep,    the  two  goliaths  were
cooperating, in principle at least.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OS/2  became  an  IBM-only project in 1989.   Microsoft  chose  to
develop  Windows further in competition with OS/2.  The  cause  of
this  battle  is  debatable,   but   it  ultimately  evolved  into
ownership  of  the  desktop  OS.  The  original  Windows  4.0  was
predicted for delivery in 1993,  then 1994. It then became Windows
95  and  was finally delivered in August 1995 to the accompaniment
of extraordinary hype.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OS/2 began as an enhanced OS to run protected mode programs,   and
multitask in the protected mode of the Intel 286 chip.  The choice
of  the  barely adequate 286 chip for this task caused significant
development delays,  so by the time it was available as OS/2  1.1,
the 386 chip was already popular.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OS/2  2.0 became a 386-only version at IBM.  It went beta in 1991,
and  shipped  GA  in 1992,  just around the time Windows  3.1  was
delivered.  From early 1992 until August of 1995, Microsoft had no
OS  that  could  really  compete,  in terms  of  multitasking  and
reliability.  Despite this three year lead in technology,  IBM was
unable to build a coordinated effort to sell OS/2,  and one result
is  that  Microsoft  has had an OS monopoly  on  the  desktop  for
almost a decade.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  full  story of this battle is much more complex and  full  of
unusual events.  For a variety of reasons, IBM had, in theory, the
better  teammore experience,  better technical  capabilities,   a
much larger sales force,  and entry into the most businesses.   So
much for theory. The OS/2 Contenders</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  situation  has  changed a lot since IBM's  announcement,   in
2000,   that  OS/2  was end-of-life and would  be  supported  with
limited enhancements and drivers through 2006.  Due to demand from
a  vocal  business user base,  IBM has increased  its  support  to
deliver  upgraded  Convenience Packs (CP)   each  year,   reducing
testing and upgrade support costs for the business community.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However,  the strategy announcement for OS/2 in 2002 contains some
significant changes to the previous environment. Specifically:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">IBM does not intend to provide additional Convenience Packages  in
the  future.  </P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>



 <P ALIGN="LEFT">There's more bad news:</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">OS/2  Defect Support:  Limited warranty defect support will expire
for  Warp  Server  for  e-business on 31  May  2002  and  for  IBM
WorkSpace On-Demand 2.0 on 31 December 2002.  IBM plans to provide
Program  defect support for OS/2 Warp 4 Convenience  Packages  and
for  Warp Server for e-business Convenience Packages for customers
with software subscriptions through 31 December 2004.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">It looks like end-of-life has been accelerated.  But the good news
is next.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As  vocal  as  the  OS/2  business users,   but  less  financially
convincing,  were the individual users such as myself. Until 2001,
it  looked like CPs were our only option.  Then something  unusual
happened.  IBM licensed OS/2 for resale to Serenity Systems,  with
the aim of supporting individuals and small businesses.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Serenity  Systems  enhanced   their   offering  by  improving  the
installation  process,  adding a large selection  (35  items)   of
independently  developed software and the Lotus Smart  Suite  from
IBM  as part of eCommStation (eCS),  their version of OS/2.   They
also included SMP as an option for the workstation version.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">eCS  1.0 shipped on April 2001 and has continued development since
then.  Serenity Systems has indicated that eCS 1.1 is expected  in
the fourth quarter of 2002,  after some selected user testing. The
list  of  enhancements planned is significant and includes  a  new
installer,  even better than the original eCS 1.0 installer, which
was a big jump over IBM's version.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">eCS'  site  contains a lot of informationpatches,   new  uploads,
news,   applications,  and links to other supporting  sites.   The
support and FAQ section is particularly useful,  and it looks like
Serenity  Systems  will  be our future support  for  OS/2.   Their
performance  in a tough business environment gives  me  confidence
for the future of OS/2 in its eCS incarnation.  BeOS is Dead. Long
Live BeOS!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">BeOS  is back live in two versions:  The original BeOS 5 personal,
and the new open source OpenBeOS.  Be was originally founded by  a
former  Apple executive,  Jean-Louis Gassée.  His  vision  was  of
hardware integrated with an OS to make the best multimedia  system
ever.  In a sense, it was like the birth of the Amigaa, except the
industry landscape had changed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Be began well.  The early systems,  built with dual processors  as
the  standard,  performed better at multimedia  than  any  of  the
existing  main players.  However this was also a clear  threat  to
both  Apple  and Microsoft,  and both responded in  typical  ways.
Apple  improved  their  offering and  Microsoft  probably  applied
pressure similar to the recent demand that Dell ship  an  OS  with
every system.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Despite  having  a better multimedia mousetrap,   somehow  Be  was
never able to get a large manufacturer to step up to the plate  to
produce and sell globally or nationally.  After an extended effort
that probably would have succeeded in any other industry,  Be  was
sold to Palm,  Inc.  Details of Be Inc.'s closing are here.  I was
among many who regretted that outcome.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However,   all  was not lost.  While BeOS is still  two  or  three
resurrections short of Amiga's record,  Be is here  again  in  two
formsthe  original flavor,  BeOS 5 Personal,  and the  developing
OpenBeOS, which is an open source project on Sourceforge.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">BeOS  5  can  be  found  at BeBits,  a layered  web  site  for  Be
developers  and  users.  It lists the latest  developed  software,
lots of drivers, downloads, and CDs of BeOS with many extras.
</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">OpenBeOS  is  a project dedicated to the recreation,  followed  by
the extension, of the BeOS.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Individual  servers and APIs (known as kits)  are being  rewritten
from  scratch by an enthusiastic team of volunteers  who  want  to
continue  the revolution started by Be Inc.  The kernel  is  being
based  on  NewOS,  a microkernel written by a former Be  engineer,
and adapted by a dedicated team of hard core programmers.</P></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR= WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Amiga is Resurrected, Again</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Phoenix  of OSes,  Commodore's Amiga,  appeared  in  1985  on
custom  hardware  with a Motorola 68000 processor  chip  and  some
very advanced chips for sound and video.  Amiga was first produced
by  Commodore Business Machines.  Commodore restructured more than
once,   and  was  finally acquired by Gateway  in  1997.   It  was
acquired  in  December  1999 by Bill  McEwen,   who  moved  it  to
Snoqualmie Ridge in January 2000.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Currently,   Bill  McEwen is President  and  CEO  of  Amiga,   now
privately  held.  His products are called a "Digital Environment,"
which  enables applications for devices from cellphones  to  large
systems,  running on multiple operating systems,  or  even  as  an
operating system.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Despite multiple moves,  the fans of Amiga and its powerful  video
capabilities  kept  bringing Amiga back.  The  Amigas  were  video
processors par excellence and could do image processing  that  was
years  in  advance of other systems.  One of the best known  video
applications  of  the Amiga was rendering  the  video  images  for
Babylon  5,  a science-fiction TV show.  A bank of 40  Amigas  was
used  to  develop beautiful and detailed imagery used  in  the  SF
series.   The  quality  and  smooth  motion  of  the  graphics  is
impressive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The new Amiga is working on some very interesting products,  which
you  can  read about in an interview with Chief Technology Officer
Fleecy  Moss.   Amiga  OS4  is still in  development  and  OS5  is
planned,   but  no schedule has been given.  The official  AmigaOS
portal will give you up to date information on the status of  this
latest release.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unlike  many  technology   companies,   Amiga  has  held  back  on
preannouncing  specifics,   but  remain  committed  to  delivering
promised products when they are ready.  It's a refreshingly  novel
approach. Is a Virtual Machine for You?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Virtual  or  emulator machines form a small but important  segment
of  the  OS  market.   They  work  by  either  emulating  the  x86
instruction  set  (slow but general purpose)  or  by  interpreting
specific  OS  calls  and  connecting or translating  them  to  the
primary OS (faster, limited OS support).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">VMWare can be hosted on Windows NT,  Windows 2000, Windows XP, and
Linux.  The virtual machine supports the Windows systems from  MS-
DOS  6  and  Windows  3.1  to Windows XP,   plus  the  main  Linux
distributions and FreeBSD 3.x and 4.0 to 4.5.</P>

VMWare identifies many usage scenarios, including:<BR>
Streamlined development and testing (for multiple OSes).<BR>
Supporting legacy applications migration.<BR>
Facilitating training and sales demos.<BR>
Improving help desk and technical support.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course the one that appeals to me the most is consolidation  of
six  systems to one or two,  running software from any OS  without
having to get all my software for that one OS.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">VMWare  also  has two server class virtual OS products.   The  GSX
version  is  for  standard servers and  the  ESX  version  is  for
servers with advanced hardware and workload management.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Virtual  PC  exists as two productsa well known Mac emulator  for
PC  software  and Virtual PC for Windows.  Both  are  products  of
Connectix.  Virtual PC will host Netware and OS/2as well  as  the
usual suspects,  Windows and Linuxon a Windows machine. As far as
I know, they are the only VM to support a virtual OS/2.</P>

At  $229,   Virtual  PC is less expensive than VMWare  Workstation
($299),   but  the choice should depend more on specific  hardware
and software support than price.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bochs  is an x86 emulator,  and as such,  will be slower than  the
other  VMs  listed  here.   It  is an  open-source  project  being
developed  on  Sourceforge  and is available  as  a  download  for
several  machines.   While it is still in development,   Bochs  is
functional for many uses.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">Current  virtual x86 machines are not efficient  because  the  386
architecture  was not designed to virtualize ring  zero  protected
mode  instructions.   What this means is that  operating  systems,
which use special instructions in ring zero,  can be emulated only
with great effort,  and thus run slowly. This problem is caused by
the  386  architecture  and  is  not  the  result  of  inefficient
programming.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This  may  now  change.  From what I've seen  of  the  AMD  Hammer
architecture and instructions,  named x86-64,  it appears possible
for  an  x86-64  OS to virtualize the x86-32 protected  ring  zero
instructions in an efficient manner.  If this is true, then we may
finally see a true virtual machine that can run current  x86  OSes
without a major performance hit.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  implications of this would be far-reaching.  If you currently
use  a  multiboot system to run FreeBSD,  Linux,  and  Windows  at
different  times,   it would be possible to run  them  efficiently
under VM-64.  If you run on separate machines as I do,  you  could
consolidate  into  one larger machine and switch  between  virtual
machines  rather than physically turn switches to change keyboard,
mouse, and display connections.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Consolidation  of  my  six systems into one large  dual  processor
system would be a win for me in space,  power,  heat, performance,
and  convenience.  More than that,  it would be a big win for  any
developer of operating systems or programs because they  could  be
isolated  in  a separate copy of the OS.  32-bit OS crashes  would
not touch the VM,  and even if a crash took the local OS down, the
VM would still be able to explore memory to find the fault.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Restarts and full memory dumps would become a thing of  the  past.
Multiple copies of Linux could run multiple Apache web servers  to
isolate  production and test environments,  or to support separate
company  sites on a shared large machine.  These things  are  done
today on mainframes and large UNIX systems from IBM, Sun, and HP.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Extending this capability to microprocessor-based computers  could
change the personal computer industry.  Imagine being able to  run
your  favorite  programs,   regardless  of  OS,   on  one  system.
Obviously the cost will include more memory and cycles,   but  the
performance  of  the latest processors makes  this  easy  even  on
single  processor systems.  As a side benefit,   even  the  memory
manufacturers may finally be able to make consistent profits.</P>
