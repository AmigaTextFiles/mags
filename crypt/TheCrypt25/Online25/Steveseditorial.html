<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> It`s not often we have a <font color=yellow>WORLD </font>Exclusive for the magazine, but we have one for you this time. Our hard working PC Editor, Ian Urie has managed to get an Interview with Dario Mollo, the famous rock star after finding out that the web site for Dario`s "The Cage" was made by the Amiga program "Lightwave".
</font>
  <p> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> I`d like to say a big thank you to all our readers that 
    have written in to us, and this issue is over flowing with the stuff you`ve 
    sent in. Also I`ve taken a few of the comments from our guest book and put 
    them onto a page to give you an idea of the sort of comments we`re getting 
    (Yes, we do read them, and take notice of what you want, like the comment 
    that the buttons on the main page we`re hard to define. So I made some more, 
    even though I`m not a graphics artist. But if anyone out there is good at 
    that sort of thing, then please contact me at the e-mail addy below, as I`m 
    still not 100% happy with them. And would like to have some that look more 
    professional) </font>
