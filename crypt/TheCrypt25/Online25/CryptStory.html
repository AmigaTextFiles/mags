<blockquote> <i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I`ve been searching 
  for a particular few songs from my early years for ages, and you know, it`s 
  bloody funny how certain songs bring back particular memories, either of good 
  times, disappointingly enough, the bad times, but lets forget the latter</font></i> 
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>But being a child of the 50`s &amp; 60`s (no lads, not the 1850`s or 
    1860`s), I used to be Disk Jockey some years ago in the days of vinyl (circles 
    of 7&quot; plastic with a song on the A-side &amp; the B-side for you youngsters 
    amongst us who`s never heard of vinyl.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><span>  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  
    </font></span><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It`s strange 
    though isn`t it folks that in the very early days of <font color=red>The Crypt 
    </font><i>with some help of the lads then, I finally decided to give myself 
    the handle of &quot;Dr Jekyll&quot;, (DJ) and I used to be a disk-jockey (DJ).....anyway, 
    that`s all immaterial at present.</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
  </span>Try to imagine, I was 17 years old, I was in my 2nd year of my Painting 
  &amp; Decorating Apprenticeship. I was working somewhere in the sticks, the 
  firm that I was working for was a general building firm and they were building 
  a new Texaco garage, I was in the process of pink-priming yards &amp; yards 
  of garage-forecourt fencing, bloody boring I can tell you, I must have used 
  about 40ltrs of pink primer.</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
  </span>Anyway, my Painting &amp; Decorating days isn`t what this article is 
  about, music is the food for thought.</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
  </span>While I was busy painting all this fencing I distinctly remember hearing  
  records by a several singers &amp; groups, one group was called The Box Tops, 
  and the song was called The Letter, after getting a PC and using WinMX to search 
  music MP3 sites I finally found this track, I also found loads more, then back 
  in my early teens I and most of my mates were bikers, every Sunday about 20 
  of us used to go to the local cafe called the &quot;Bus-Station&quot;, where 
  surprisingly enough buses ran to &amp; from, it was the main bus terminus.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>Anyway, out of all the records my mates &amp; me used to play most 
    Sundays was one by a group called Hawkwind and the title was called &quot;Silvermachine&quot;, 
    I`ve found that via WinMX, so, The Box Tops made me remember all that bloody 
    priming when I was an apprentice, Hawkwind made me remember my biker days, 
    John Fred &amp; His Playboy Band singing &quot;Judy In Disguise (with Glasses) 
    also made me remember my apprenticeship days so did The Monkees with &quot;I`m 
    a believer&quot;, Jimi Hendrix singing Burning the Midnight Lamp was the first 
    record that I heard from this brilliant guitarist and made me want to hear 
    more of his stuff, finally getting hold of old Vinyl LP`s called Are You Experienced, 
    Axis Bold As Love and more, soon made me realize that although sadly passed 
    away, he was a brilliant guitarist and talent that would/is still listened 
    to by thousands of fans..</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>I can vaguely remember when or where I was when certain records were 
    hits, for instance, when Womack &amp; Woman were in the charts with a hit 
    that I think was called &quot;Teardrop&quot; or Teardrops, I was in Winson 
    Green in Birmingham, no, not shopping, but in Prison. But that`s another story.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>Songs like  &quot;New Song&quot; &amp; &quot;Look Mama&quot; which 
    were sung by a guy called Howard Jones made me realize that I was living In 
    Warwick and in the midst of my Disco years, songs by George &amp; Culture 
    Club like &quot;Do you really want to hurt me&quot; etc etc, Stacie Lattishaw 
    &amp; &quot;Jump to the beat&quot;, I can even go back in my disco days of 
    DJaying to Susan Gadugan &amp; &quot;Hurt So Good&quot;, the Bay City Rollers 
    &amp; Shang-A-Lang as well, The Four Seasons &amp; Oh What a night - December 
    63` (I think the full title was).</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>I fact, when I packed up my disco`s and was about to sell the whole 
    lot to a couple of brothers who were starting up I manage to keep back about 
    50 of my more-or-less all time favourite singles, but over the years with 
    recording technology as it was/is, most, not all of my favourite vinyl records 
    have been fantastically transferred to CD, there`s only the odd few that up 
    till going on the PC was only memories of how much I`d like to get hold of 
    them again and keep on CD, Hawkwind etc.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>Up till my PC days I was a true-blue Amiga user, don`t get me wrong, 
    the Amiga is probably &quot;THE&quot; best multitasking home computer ever 
    designed &amp; created, but being a PC user now, I realize the Amiga is a 
    dinosaur, if I offend any of you 100% Amiga users then I`m sorry but I`ve 
    been on the Amiga for years, and unless your a moron there`s so much that 
    a PC can do with the minimum of ease that an Amiga could only dream about.</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
  </span>The main problem with the PC is Windows (Windoze), an utterly shit operating 
  system, but I`m digressing from my article.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>  I</span>f 
    any of you readers what to write into either me or to the mag in general with 
    a similar article about what music reminds you of what you were doing and 
    where you were at the time I for one would be only to pleased to read your 
    stuff.</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>So, that`s about it for now, hope you enjoy the rest of our mag, and 
    please don`t forget that even with our staff writing team doing their best 
    to make our mag a good read for you, we still need<font color=yellow> &quot;YOUR&quot; 
    </font>input, we can write about our own personal stuff, but we have &amp; 
    only will survive with continuos new input, we`ve managed for these past few 
    years by being a 1-platform disk mag for &quot;Amiga-Users-Only&quot; at one 
    time, then we shifted to a more open approach, and we`re still here, which 
    goes to show that not only with the team, but also with the readers we seem 
    to have found a very workable combination,</i></font></p>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><span>    
    </span>And being one of the original founder members of<font color=red> TC </font>I`d like to say 
    a very big<font color=yellow> &quot;THANK YOU&quot;</font> to <font color=yellow>&quot;EVERYONE&quot;, 
    </font>that`s the staff and our readers, because basically folks, it doesn`t 
    matter how we are, without you there would be no point in carrying on would 
    there, so, to everyone......keep up the great work, well, that`s if you can 
    call this work....till next time......tara 4 now......</i></font></p>
