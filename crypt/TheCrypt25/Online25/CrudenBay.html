 <FONT COLOR=AQUA> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For it
was  while Bram Stoker was staying in the coastal village  at  the
Kilmarnock  Arms  Hotel in 1895 that he was inspired  to  write  a
tale of the supernatural,  and based the vampire's lair on Slain's
Castle  -  an  impressive structure which overlooks  the  crashing
waves  on the rocks overlooking the village.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The castle today  is
an  extensive ruin that can be reached by a footpath from the Main
Street  car  park in the village or from a car park to  the  North
East of the village on the A975.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all coastal areas around
Aberdeenshire,   great  care must be taken  when  walking  on  the
cliffs  around  Slains  Castle,  and  this  is  also  particularly
relevant  at  the   nearby   Bullers   O'   Buchan  which  provide
spectacular  views of sea chasms cut into the rock.   Located  off
the  A975 three miles north of Cruden Bay,  the Bullers  are  some
200  feet  deep in places,  and the cliff scenery is some  of  the
most breathtaking in Britain.  A wide variety of seabirds,
also  proliferates at the cliffs,  and there are information signs
at  the  Bullers to keep visitors informed of what they  may  see.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cruden  Bay  has a wealth of historical buildings,   and  this  is
particularly  in evidence with the number of churches  it  has  in
and  around its boundaries.  The Old Church of Cruden,  which lies
between  Cruden Bay and the village of Hatton,  is  an  impressive
building  dating  back  to  1776 - enlarged  in  1834  -  and  its
graveyard contains many evocative family stones.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St. James Church
lies to the south of the village on the ridge of Chapel Hill,  and
it  is visible for miles around and was built in 1765 by the  Earl
of  Erroll.   Its font is said to have originated  from  a  church
built  by  Malcolm  II on the battlefield of Cruden  to  mark  his
victory against a Danish army led by Canute.  In addition  to  its
wealth  of local craft and antique shops,  Cruden Bay also  caters
for those who enjoy leisure activities,  and this is most apparent
at  its  18-hole  championship golf course.  The links  course  is
highly  regarded as one of the best in Britain,  and  also  has  a
nine hole course,  top-class new clubhouse, professional shop, and
clubs and caddy car facilities.</P>
