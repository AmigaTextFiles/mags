<P ALIGN="LEFT">Although  it  has become commonplace to associate  England's  most
famous  stone  circle,  Stonehenge,  with the  mysterious  ancient
order known as the Druids,  in truth,  the two have little  or  no
historical  connection.    This   fallacy  is  just  one  of  many
misconceptions about Druids that has carried over into the  modern
age.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Druidism,  in fact, traces its origins to ancient Wales, where the
order  began  long  before the advent of written history.   Druids
were the priests of the early Celtic religion,  on the top rung of
the  three-tiered  Celtic society consisting of serfs,   warriors,
and  learned  men.   But in addition to their religious  function,
Druids  also performed the roles of judge,  doctor,  and  scholar.
They  were  educated through a long and grueling process  of  rote
memorization.  Druidic law forbade its followers to write down any
of  the  religious  teachings,   a  rule  that  has  unfortunately
prevented  us  from  having firsthand knowledge  of  their  Celtic
religion.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">What  historical records we do have of the Druids come to us  from
non-objective sources:  Posidonius,  a Greek writer who supposedly
visited  Gaul  in  the  second century BC;   Julius  Caesar,   who
recorded his observations about the Druids in his account  of  the
Gallic  War,   written  after the Roman invasion  of  the  British
Isles;  and the Roman writer Tacitus whose Annals of Imperial Rome
and Germanica were written after the consolidation of Britain.  In
these  records,  the writers all remark upon the Druids' extensive
knowledge,  particularly in the fields of mathematics,  astronomy,
and physics.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But  in  addition to their learning,  early historians  also  took
note  of what they considered to be the Druids' barbaric religious
practices.  In particular,  they were appalled by the use of human
sacrifice.  The Romans reported that victims were tied  to  wicker
effigies   and   burned   alive,    a   report   substantiated  by
archaeological  remains.   Further  evidence  has  been  found  of
'triple  deaths'  where  a   victim   was  simultaneously  stoned,
drowned, and impaled on a spear.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Celtic  religion  did involve elements of ritual  sacrifice,   but
Druids (and Celts in general)  did not conceive of death  the  way
in which we do today.  As Caesar comments,  'The cardinal doctrine
which  they  seek to teach is that souls do not  die,   but  after
death pass from one to another .  .  .  the fear of death is  cast
aside.'  Often,  sacrifice involved a spiritual trade  of  sorts--
sacrificing  a  less prominent member of society so  that  someone
more important might survive.  Caesar wrote:  "The whole nation of
the  Gauls is greatly devoted to ritual observances and  for  that
reason  those who are smitten with the more grievous maladies  and
who  are  engaged  in the peril of battle either  sacrifice  human
victims  or  vow to do so,  employing the druids as ministers  for
such sacrifice.  They believe in effect, that, unless a man's life
be paid, the majesty of the immortal gods may not be appeased."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">These  accounts were,  no doubt,  coloured by the Romans' personal
biases.  Caesar,  in particular,  was trying to garner support for
his  campaign  from his audience at home,  a task made  easier  by
painting a barbaric picture of the Druids.  (Barbaric,  to a Roman
audience who flocked to see equally gruesome deaths at  the  hands
of the gladiators.)  Nevertheless, both Roman and Greek historians
did  record  the  Druids' highly organized legal  and  educational
systems,   and seemed to revere their mathematical and  scientific
knowledge.   Both  sources considered  the  Druids  to  be  'noble
savages',  a highly learned but religiously primitive  people  who
worshipped a pantheon of gods.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After  Emperor Claudius declared Druidic practices illegal  in  AD
54,   the  Druids'  future  in Roman Britain  became  increasingly
uncertain.  In AD 61, the Romans planned a massacre of the defiant
Druids at Anglesey,  the centre of their culture,  and their  last
stronghold in consolidated Britain.  As the Roman soldiers  waited
for  the tide to recede so they could cross the Menai strait  that
separates  Anglesey  from the mainland,   the  Druids  held  their
position  by lining up along the opposite shore and,   as  Tacitus
reports  in  his  Annals,   'raising their  hands  to  heaven  and
screaming dreadful curses.' But curses were not enough.  The Roman
soldiers  crossed the strait and conquered the island,  destroying
both the Druids and the sacred groves of their religion.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Following  this defeat,  the Druidic culturenever again flourished
as  it  did  in  these  early days.  Pockets of  it  persisted  in
Ireland,  however,  and forward-thinking monks in both Ireland and
Wales  preserved some Druidic traditions.  Much of what was  known
about  Druids  continued to exist solely  in  the  oral  tradition
until  the Medieval period when it was transcribed and  edited  by
Christian monks.  Although these records come filtered  through  a
biased source,  these manuscripts have passed on much of  what  we
know today about the Druids of ancient Britain.  In Ireland, these
myths  exist in four chief cycles:  the Ulster Cycle,   the  Fionn
Cycle,  the Invasion Races,  and the Cycle of Kings. In Wales, the
primary  source  of  Druidic information,   and  indeed  the  very
cornerstone  of   Welsh   literary   tradition,    exists  in  The
Mabinogion,   a collection of myths and tales transcribed  in  the
11th century.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In  the  early  18th  century,  interest in Druidism  underwent  a
revival,  primarily as a result of the less-than-noble efforts  of
one man,  Edward Williams, or, Iolo Morganwyg as he was known, who
claimed  to  have  discovered an ancient  Welsh  book  of  Druidic
knowledge.  This book, called The Barddas was later revealed to be
a  forgery.  Morganwyg made up most of what was contained  within,
including the ceremony of Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain,   or,   The
Assembly  of  Bards  on the Isle of Britain.  Morganwyg  held  the
first Gorsedd ceremony in 1792 on London's Primrose Hill.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  similar  type of ceremony,  incorporating elements  of  ancient
Druidic  ritual,  had been taking place in Wales for  hundreds  of
years  prior  to  Morganwyg's event.  The Eisteddfod,   an  annual
celebratory  gathering of Welsh bards,  dates  back  to  the  15th
century.   By  the  1700s,   however,   interest  was  waning  and
enthusiasm for the event was low.  In 1858,  however,  Morganwyg's
Gorsedd ceremonies,  although wholly fictitious, were incorporated
into the Eisteddfod, and gave it a new life.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It  was  during this period of Romantic Revival that most  of  the
misconceptions about Druidism took root.  The most common, linking
Druids  with   Stonehenge,    is   clearly   a   fallacy.   Recent
archaeological findings date Stonehenge to more than  2,000  years
before  the  rise  of  Druidism.  Although Druids  did  use  stone
circles  and   astronomical   calculations   in   their  spiritual
practices, no such monuments of their making have survived.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Modern-day  Druids,  however,  have latched on to the  connection,
and often hold solstice celebrations at Stonehenge.  (Unlike their
ancient  predecessors,  no human sacrifice is involved.)   Indeed,
Druidism  is alive and well today and enjoying a late 20th-century
revival  of sorts.  The Eisteddfod,  still celebrated annually  in
Wales,   is  held  during  the first week  of  August  each  year.
Although  the  modern  ceremony   has   veered  more  towards  the
cultural,   rather than religious,  celebration,   the  Eisteddfod
remains true to its Druidic roots.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But  just as the sacrificial rituals of the ancient Druids created
controversy  in  ancient  times,   so  today  modern  Druids  find
themselves at the centre of debate.  This controversy comes  to  a
head  around  the  21st  of  June each  year  when  modern  Druids
converge upon what is undoubtedly one of the most-visited  tourist
attractions in all of Britain to commemorate the summer  solstice.
English  Heritage and The National Trust,  who jointly manage  the
property  are  usually  less   than   welcoming  to  these  annual
uninvited  guests.   Stonehenge,   which  stood  before  even  the
original  Druids  may  have gathered among its  mysterious  stones
somehow puts the controversy into perspective.</P>
