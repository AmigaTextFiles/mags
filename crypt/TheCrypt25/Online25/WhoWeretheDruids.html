<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>The ancient megaliths and stone circles,  such as Stonehenge, have
often been associated with the Druids.  Lurid tales of "religious"
ceremonies involving human sacrifice,  presided over by a  strange
class  of mystical priests,  have come down to us.  Often,   these
stories take place inside one of the stone circles,  or "temples."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>While  we don't know about the human sacrifices,  we do know  that
the  megalithic structures were constructed long before the  first
reports about the Druids ever came to public attention.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  question  of who invaded Britain in prehistoric  times,   and
when  these  incursions took place,  was much debated  by  earlier
generations of scholars.  Bloody battles were imagined,  in  which
one  race virtually exterminated another and populated the country
anew.  Mysterious "Beaker folk" were said to have arrived  in  the
third  millennium B.C.  introducing metalwork  and  burying  their
chiefs  in barrow tombs along with their favorite beakers.   After
them  came the Celts;  around 600 B.C.  was the accepted date  for
their appearance in Britain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  nature  of these invasions and their supposed dates  are  all
now disputed.  Archaeological science earlier in this century  was
much concerned with racial types,  and it was fashionable to argue
that  successive invaders prevailed because they were of  superior
stock  to the natives.  At the root of these theories was Darwin's
theory of evolution and belief in progress.  The influence of such
theories has now waned,  and scholars are more inclined to  regard
social  changes  as  being produced by migrations  of  culture  at
least  as  much as by warfare.  In ancient times,  as today,   new
ideas  spread  quickly enough around the world  without  violence.
Nor  is  there  any more certainty about the date  of  the  Celts'
arrival.  One can speak of Celtic culture and languages, but there
is no single Celtic race;  Celtic speakers vary in appearance from
short  and  swarthy to tall and fair.  Evidence of Celtic  culture
appears in Britain from the second millennium B.C.,  and it is now
suggested  that the Celtic priesthood could have been  responsible
for the Stonehenge temple, built in about 2000 B.C.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Celtic  society  in  Britain  preserved  many  features  from  the
previous  order,  including shrines and feast days.  Its  calendar
combined  lunar  and solar cycles,  as in megalithic  times.   The
social structure was similar to that advocated by Plato,  based on
a religious cosmology and democratic idealism.  Each tribe had its
own  territory with fixed borders,  and that land,   held  by  the
tribe  as  a  whole,  consisted of forest and wilderness,   common
lands and agricultural holdings.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under a complicated system of land tenure,  everyone's rights  and
obligations were carefully defined.  Some of the land  was  worked
in common for the chieftain,  the priests,  and the old, poor, and
sick  tribesfolk;   the  rest  was apportioned  as  family  farms.
Grazing and foraging rights were shared on the common lands.  Much
of  the  tribal business was conducted at annual assemblies  where
land  disputes  were decided,  petty offenders  were  tried,   and
chiefs  and  officials,  both male and female,  were appointed  by
popular vote.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  great  many old farmsteads in Britain,  today,  are  on  Celtic
sites.   During  his raid on Celtic Britain in  55  B.C.,   Julius
Caesar  commented  on its high population and numerous  farms  and
cattle.  The unifying bond between all the Celtic tribes was their
common  priesthood,  the Druids.  Their efforts  preserved  common
culture,  religion,  history, laws, scholarship, and science. They
had  paramount authority over every tribal chief and,  since their
office  was sacred,  they could move where they wanted.   settling
disputes  and stopping battles by compelling the rival parties  to
arbitration.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  managed  the higher legal system and the courts  of  appeal,
and  their  colleges  in   Britain   were  famous  throughout  the
Continent.  Up to twenty years of oral instruction and  memorizing
was  required of a pupil before being admitted into  their  order.
Minstrels  and  bards  were educated by  the  Druids  for  similar
periods.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowledge of the Druids comes directly from classical  writers  of
their  time.   They  were compared to the learned  priesthoods  of
antiquity,   the  Indian  Brahmins,  the  Pythagoreans,   and  the
Chaldean astronomers of Babylon. Caesar wrote that they</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>"know  much about the stars and celestial motions,  and about  the
size of the earth and universe,  and about the essential nature of
things,  and about the powers and authority of' the immortal gods;
and these things they teach to their pupils."</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  also  taught   the   traditional   doctrine  of  the  soul's
immortality.  They must have professed detailed knowledge  of  the
workings of reincarnation,  for one writer said that they  allowed
debts incurred in one lifetime to be repaid in the next.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  significant remark of Caesar's was that Druidism originated  in
Britain,   which  was its stronghold.  Indeed,   it  has  all  the
appearance  of  a  native religion,  being deeply  rooted  in  the
primeval native culture.  Its myths and heroic legends are related
to  the ancient holy places of Britain,  and they may largely have
been adapted from much earlier traditions.  In Celtic,  as in  all
previous  times,   the  same holy wells and  nature  shrines  were
visited on certain days for their spiritual virtues.  The  overall
pattern  of  life was scarcely changed.  In the  course  of  time,
society  became more structured and elaborate and the  Druid  laws
more rigid,  but the beginning of the Celtic period in Britain was
evidently not marked by any major break in tradition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nor  was there any great shift in population;  the British  today,
even  in the so-called Celtic lands,  are predominantly of  native
Mesolithic ancestry.  The Druids' religion and science  also  have
the  appearance  of  belonging   to  an  earlier  Britain.   Their
knowledge  of  astronomy may have descended from  the  priests  of
megalithic  times,   together with the spiritual  secrets  of  the
landscape.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet  there is an obvious difference between the Celtic Druids  and
the  megalithic  priests before them.  The  Druids  abandoned  the
great stone temples and reverted to the old natural shrines,   the
springs  and  groves where they held their rituals.   A  religious
reformation  is  here  implied.  It  is  characteristic  of  state
priesthoods  that their spiritual powers wane  as  their  temporal
authority grows;  and the less confidence they inspire,  the  more
tributes  and sacrifices they demand of the people In  its  latter
days  the  rule  of the megalithic priesthood probably  became  so
onerous that it was overthrown.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether  as  a   native   development   or   prompted  by  outside
influences,  a spiritual revival seems to have occurred in Britain
in  about  2000  B.C.  with the building of the cosmic  temple  of
Stonehenge  and the first evidences of Celtic culture.  Stonehenge
is a unique monument,  a symbol of a new revelation.  The tendency
in  modern scholarship is to see it once more as the temple of the
Druids,  If so,  it proclaims the high ideals on which Druidism in
Britain was founded.</P></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
