<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga Party Pack purchasers? This is for you! </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Each of you received your Party Pack and in the very near future you will be 
able to use the discounts that are associated with your Party Pack purchase. 
Each of you will receive an e-mail explaining your options, and the process is 
simple:</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> You may purchase the products directly from Amiga at the discounted price 
and the products will be shipped to your door.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">or</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">2.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Once you have purchased either the AmigaOne with OS 4.0, or if you 
purchase just OS 4.0, send us a copy of the receipt along with the front page 
of your SDK manual and Amiga will send you back a check for $100.00! </font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">or</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">3.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Let us know the retailer that you will be using and we will get them the 
$100.00 so you do not need to worry about it. </font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not a bad deal at all. Each of you have had the chance to work with AmigaDE 
and many of you have become developers of Amiga Anywhere content, 
because of the party pack. Now soon you will be able to get $100.00 back 
when you purchase a new AmigaOne system. </P>
