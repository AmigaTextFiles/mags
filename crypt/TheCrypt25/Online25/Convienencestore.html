<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Convenience  Store -<FONT COLOR=AQUA> the corner shop.   Everyone's  got  one,
quite local to them,   usually on the corner of the road.  Always
there,  always open,  except when you run  out of milk at 2am  or
the cat's just come in and wants feeding,  then they're closed.  
We  take  them  for granted,  and then moan when they  close  down
because the new  supermarket that opened recently that's about  2
miles away,  has taken all the  custom,  and they can't afford to
compete and stay open.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's  not  easy  to  run a little corner shop - ask  anyone  who's
tried it,  and they'll tell  you all about it.  I know,  I manage
one.  Let me give you an example of a typical  working day.  Do I
hear you say "That's boring"? Not likely. Just try this for size.
The  shop  opens from 7am until 10pm at night,  every day,   seven
days a week,  all  year round.  There's no rest for the wicked  -
just  that  I'd  like the opportunity to be   wicked  once  in  a
while.<FONT COLOR=WHITE><B>:-)</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">I've  recovered from my little excersion to Blackpool.  They  were
very  pleased  to  see  me back at work.  We have  gained  a  new
member  of  staff  who  used to work at the    store  some  years
before, and wished to return in a part-time capacity, as she had 
enjoyed  the  work.   She also had a day-time  job  at  the  local
hospital,  and worked in  the store a few evenings  a  week  just
for extra money.  After the last girl had left,   she decided she
liked working at the store so much, offered to cover that girl's 
shifts  and  handed in her notice at the hospital!  It's  nice  to
know  that our little team  and store is so comfortable  to  work
in.  This staff member will do very well, I think.  She has found
things  have  changed over the past few years,  but obviously  for
the   better.  By now,  this magazine will have been read by  her
family, so she should  recognise herself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Whilst she and I were on duty one evening,  we were discussing the
difference  between daytime and evening customers.  She had noted
that  the customer's  attitudes hadn't changed that much in  five
years,   and  I was explaining that daytime  customers  were  far
easier going and less exacting than evening customers,  when  she
discovered  the  classic type. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">These are the ones  we  find  most
annoying.   He   came in and wandered around the  store,   before
settling on the product he wanted  to purchase.  Proudly carrying
two  sets  of  beer over to the counter and setting   them  down.
Beer  can usually be bought separately by the can,  but,  as  they
come   in the cases linked by the plastic loops in sets of  four,
we keep them that way to 
 enable customers to pick up the set  of
four easily.  Most beers in our store are sold  that way, but, if
customers  just want to buy one,  they release the  can  from  the
loop  and take the amount they need.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">However,  this customer  it
appeared,  couldn't  quite grasp this simple notion. He picked up
two  different  sets of four cans from  the shelf  and  set  them
down  on  the  counter.  The cans were scanned  in  the  normal  
fashion - quantity 4 and scan the barcode from one can.  He looked
absolutely    staggered at the amount on the till  display,   and
began  to argue that the price was  wrong.  The assistant  called
me over to check the price, and it was correct.</P>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"I'm not paying that!"</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> he exclaimed.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>What's the problem?</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I asked,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>The price is correct</I>"</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"No."</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said,<FONT COLOR=LIME> <B>"It's £1.12"</B></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Yes.  That's what I said</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I was getting puzzled by this time.  He
was  agreeing that  the price was correct,  but still maintaining
it  was wrong.  He took me to the shelf  and pointed at the label
which clearly stated £1.12.  Then he picked up the next   set  of
four  cans from the shelf and said he wanted enough cans  to  make
it up to  £5.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>But  if you add another can,  it will take you above £5</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I  said,
still puzzled.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"No. I want all of them"</B></P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>For £5?</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>I asked, eyebrows reaching the hairline.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"That's what it says."</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said, <FONT COLOR=LIME ><B>"They're in fours,  and  I  can't
get one."</B></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=LIME >

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Yes  you  can.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I reply, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Just take one out of the  pack</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA>,   and
demonstrated,    removing just one from the  set  of  four,   and
scanned it.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Now, how many would  you like?</I>"</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">He  stood and looked,  first at me,  then at the beers,  then  the
waiting  assistant,  and  finally back at me.  He then  shrugged,
turned  around  and said <FONT COLOR=LIME><B>"Forget it.  I won't  bother.   I  still
don't understand."</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> Then he walked out of the door.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Eventually  we  understood what he thought  he  was  getting.   He
thought  the price of  £1.12 was for all four of the  cans,   not
individual  prices,  and couldn't understand   why  he  had  been
charged £4.48.  He must have thought I was totally bonkers   when
I  removed  just one can from the set of four,  scanned  that  and
showed him  the price was £1.12 for just the one. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I  just  wonder where he's been for the past few years?  Beer  has
not  been  priced  at    56p per pint for ages.   If  he's  still
managing  to  buy some at that price,  I'd love to   know  where.
Then we'll all go out and get drunk for not-very-much. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Daytime  customers are usually housewives with  children  and  the
elderly,  and,  at this  time of year,  augmented by children  on
their  summer holiday from school.   Children can  be  funny  and
exasperating  in  turns - amusing for their underestimation    of
how  far  their <FONT COLOR=WHITE> (or  their  parents)<FON COLOR=AQUA>  money  will  stretch,   and
exasperating  by  having to  constantly  change  items  until  it
reaches  the correct amount.  For each alteration of    sale,   a
supervisor  or  the  manager has to  be  called,   as  refunds  or
deletion of items  have to be countersigned,  causing  queues  to
grow,   and  these  things nearly always   occur  as  a  delivery
arrives leaving staff in a quandry as to whether to answer  the  
call  from the shop floor,  or the warehouse door at the  rear  of
the shop.  Difficult  when there is a shortage of staff due to it
also being the holiday season. </font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Deliveries have caused a problem recently.  We are situated on the
junction  of  a   main road and side street,  with  other  shops
opposite.  We are lucky enough to 
 have the only carpark  in  the
area,   albeit a very small one,  which tends  to  be  used    by
everyone  shopping in the area,  and not always  shopping  in  our
store,   despite  signs to the contrary. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Most of our  deliveries
are  by  lorry,  either small 7.5 ton ones  or larger articulated
lorries from the main warehouse.  Most of the usual drivers  know
access  is  easier for them if they park on the road and off-load,
pushing  the   loads across the carpark into the warehouse,   but
occasionally we get new or  obstinate drivers who wish  to  drive
into the carpark to offload.  Recently we have  had two incidents
leaving us helpless with laughter,  caused by car driver's lack of
thought or stupidity depending on your point of view.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both  incidents  involved   articulated  units  holding  our  main
delivery which were  much needed,  as we had had very good  sales
leaving the store very low on stock.   The first we usually  know
about  the arrival of the lorry is as it appears on the  opposite
side  of the road outside the front of the store.  Then the driver
waits  for  a  suitable gap in traffic and starts to reverse  the
lorry into the side street,  temporarily  blocking the main  road
as  it  straddles both lanes.  Usually this manoeuvre  proceeds  
without  incident,  the driver parks up and checks we are  waiting
with  the  warehouse   doors open,  ready to  receive  the  load,
offloads,  etc.  Not on this occasion,  unfortunately.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The driver
was  new to our town,  having been reassigned to cover  holidays,
and  had  not  been  prior warned on access  difficulties  by  the
regular    drivers.  He had just started reversing  up  the  side
street,   having blocked the main  road,  when he noticed  a  car
coming behind him.  His colleague had been guiding  him in,   and
indicated  he had to stop,  whilst he spoke to the driver  of  the
car    requesting that they back up a little  way  so  the  lorry
could park. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Sounded  reasonable to everyone around,  except  the
occupants  of the car,  who were smartly  dressed elderly  ladies
with attitude!  No,  they weren't prepared to back up,  as they  
were  there first,  and insisted the lorry move out and  go  round
the  block before  trying again,  allowing them time to  proceed!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Despite  objections and the size of the  lorry,  they steadfastly
refused to concede,  which left the driver, already in a difficult
position,  no choice but to drive out again, and drive off round
the  block<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (about 1  mile)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>,  before returning to start  all  over
again.  Smugly,  the ladies continued their  journey,  having won
the battle,  without a care in the world, leaving the poor lorry 
driver  extremely irritable and frustrated.  Poor  guys  needed  a
cuppa to calm down  before continuing,  and complained the  whole
time to all and everyone in earshot! </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That incident was discussed and laughed about all week,  until the
next delivery,   which was worse! Yet another main delivery, on a
40 foot trailer,  wishing to make 
 the same manoeuvre,  different
driver and a slightly different problem.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">This  particular driver
is  well  known  for his stubborn-ness amongst his colleagues  and
us.     He  had delivered to us before,  so knew the difficulties
regarding  access,   but also,   he  had  been  told  to  offload
directly  into  the warehouse from the back  of  the  lorry    to
prevent  stock loss during transfer.  He knew he could  back  into
the  carpark  and    the  vehicle could be  observed  continually
during transfer of stock,  but in doing so,   he would block  the
entrance/exit to the carpark,  a risk he was prepared to take. </P> 
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately,  the side street is narrow and these vehicles  need
all  the  room  to  swing round whilst reversing.   Opposite  the
carpark  entrance  there is a 6 foot  brick   wall  alongside  a
narrow  pavement  which  gave  little  room  for  error.   This  
manoeuvre can be done with care,  provided there is no traffic  or
parked  vehicles  nearby,  including the vehicles in the carpark.
However,   this was not the case on  this occasion. </P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  street
seemed to have attracted a multitude of vehicles,  all  parked in
just  the  wrong place,  and we had the job of finding the  owners
and  asking them to move.  Not all of the owners were shopping in
our  store,  of course,   leaving 15 other shops to  chose  from.
This  had two members of staff and the  driver tracking down  the
culprits,   which took twenty minutes.  Most were  located    and
moved  their vehicles including one which was causing the  biggest
problem,    parked just beyond the carpark entrance. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Whilst  the
lorry driver was searching for  him,  he returned and drove  off,
leaving  the road clear.  We waited for our  delivery  driver  to
return,  and was preparing a drink for him in the meantime.  As  
he  returned to the front of the store,  we told him all was clear
at  the  back  and he  could start to reverse into  the  carpark.
Pleased,   he  returned to his lorry to find  that,   whilst  our
backs had been turned,  another driver had parked in exactly the 
same  place,  thus blocking the entrance again.  Pleased,  he  was
not.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">He was not  prepared to off load the lorry where it was, as
he  felt it would be insecure,  also he  felt he would be causing
an  obstruction with the lorry there.  His blood pressure    must
have  reached critical levels by this time,  plus  he  was  making
noises about  taking the load back to the depot as he was  unable
to  deliver  it. </P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">He  went  yet  again  in  search  of  another
thoughtless motorist,  whilst we waited. Luckily, we  spotted the
owner  dawdling  along the road before he did  and  managed  to  
persuade  him to move before he received a tirade from  the  lorry
driver.  When the  lorry driver returned,  everything  was  clear
and at last we could receive our delivery.   Before he left,   he
phoned  the  warehouse to complain about  the  difficulties  in  
delivering the load,  requesting that something be done about  the
problem  for  the   future. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't suppose anything  will,   of
course,   but  the  whole incident caused    much  merriment  and
continues to do so when related to subsequent delivery    drivers
despairing about lack of access,  particularly last week's  driver
who ripped off  a few branches of a tree when reversing.  When we
mention  who it was,  they  sympathise with us as they  are  well
aware  of that particular driver's temperament.   Not  a  day  we
would wish to repeat in a hurry.  Usually the whole delivery takes
 just 20 minutes, not over an hour and a half!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes  the  problem with the delivery is not  the  offloading,
but,   rather the  content of the delivery.  The  order  is  made
electronically with a hand held device,   which scans items.   As
the  main  PC  knows how many of each item we hold  (supposedly),
we  scan  the  barcode and enter the amount we  wish  to  increase
stock  by.  For instance,  if there are only 15 chocolate bars on
the shelf,  we scan the  barcode,  and the PC should confirm that
we  only have 15 in stock.  Sometimes,  if  someone has taken one
without payment,  the stock figure will be higher,  but  usually
the figure is correct.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">We enter 1 to add a whole box (usually  20
bars),  but  occasionally we can accidentally hit a 4,  sometimes
with the 1,  making 14 or 41!! Imagine our surprise when 41 x  15
x 1 kilo bags of sugar arrived!  It took two  weeks to be able to
return  those to the main warehouse,  which we had stripped  of  
sugar! </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Since then,  we have had 33 boxes of multipack crisps,  72
bottles  of the  same wine,  and 14 packs of 1 litre  pop.   Once
entered  in  error,  there seems to be  no way of correcting  the
mistake  - stupid machines,  and equally stupid people  at    the
other  end,   who  blindly accept these figures without  checking.
Still, it gives us  a laugh.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Who says running a store is dull and boring? Not me.  See you next
time, if I can  find a way through all the stock.</P>
