 <P ALIGN="LEFT">One evening a grandson was talking to his grandmother about current 
 events. The grandson asked his grandmother what she thought about 
 the shootings at schools, the computer age, and just things in general.</P> 
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The Grandma replied, <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>"Well, let me think a minute, I was born, before 
 television, penicillin, polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox, contact lenses, 
 Frisbees and the pill. There was no radar, credit cards, laser beams or 
 ball-point pens. </I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Man had not invented pantyhose, air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes 
 dryers, and the clothes were hung out to dry in the fresh air and man 
 hadn't yet walked on the moon. </I></P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Your Grandfather and I got married first-and then lived together. Every 
 family had a father and a mother. Until I was 25, I called every man 
 older than I, 'Sir'- and after I turned 25, I still called policemen 
 and every man with a title, "Sir.' We were before gay-rights, computer-
 dating, dual careers, daycare centers, and group therapy. Our lives 
 were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and common sense.</I></P> 
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>We were taught to know the difference between right and wrong and to 
 stand up and take responsibility for our actions.  Serving your country 
 was a privilege; living in this country was a bigger privilege. We 
 thought fast food was what people ate during Lent.</I></P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Having a meaningful relationship meant getting along with your cousins. 
 Draft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the evening 
 breeze started. Time-sharing meant time the family spent together in the 
 evenings and weekends - not purchasing condominiums.</I></P> 
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>We never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters, 
 yogurt, or guys wearing earrings. We listened to the Big Bands, Jack 
 Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios. And I don't ever 
 remember any kid blowing his brains out listening to Tommy Dorsey.</I> </P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>If you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk. The term 
 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam.</I></P> 
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of. We had 5 & 
 10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and 10 cents. 
 Ice-cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were 
 all a nickel. And if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your 
 nickel on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards.</I></P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>You could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600 but who could afford one? 
 Too bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon.</I></P> 
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>In my day, "grass" was mowed, "coke" was a cold drink, "pot" was 
 something your mother cooked in, and "rock music" was your grandmother's 
 lullaby. "Aids" were helpers in the Principal's office, "chip" meant a 
 piece of wood, "hardware" was found in a hardware store, and "software" 
 wasn't even a word. </I></P>
 
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>And we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady needed a 
 husband to have a baby. No wonder people call us "old and confused" and 
 say there is a generation gap.....</I></P> 
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">and how old do you think I am ???..... </P></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
