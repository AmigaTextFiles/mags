<P ALIGN="LEFT">What a week for legal eagles it has been, the European Court rules that
Transsexuals can marry. Mr Blunkett rules that the Cannabis users should
not be thought of as criminals and downgrades the drug from class B to
class C.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Keith Hellawell, the drugs Czar, resigned because of it. His experience
as a bobby and eventually a Chief Constable ( <I>West Yorkshire</I> ) made him
view the action as premature if not wrong.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A lad fra 'burton Keith had a lot of Yorkshire common sense and not
knowing enough about it myself I have to back his judgement.
Unlike Mr Clinton I did inhale, at a folk festival many years ago. ( <I>Ok
officer slap on the bracelets</I> )</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Then we have Consignia  sorry ! The Post Office wanting to charge people
to have their mail delivered early.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bad enough that we might be charged a quid a bag for rubbish<FONT COLOR=RED> ;-) </font></P><FONT COLOR=RED>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">But there we have environmental considerations to blame.
Mac says if there are charges for rubbish I would have a lot to pay on
Sunday mornings.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Oh blow the news. Let's talk about an event only 13 days off. Now
Grannie Annie always said that there was nothing wrong with the number
but I differ.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She is coming ! Eliz that is and Stacey and Laura and Chris and James.
With Mac that makes for an Enid Blyton style adventure of the Famous
Six, I got asked which chippie they would get taken to. What me I
exclaimed ! I'm a pensioner and poor as a church mouse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have you claimed the Minimum Income Guarantee grandad said Stacey.
Bright kids these so I got onto the lady at the free telephone line.
Well if you can't afford ice-cream for Elizabeth she said I'd better
send you that extra £19 a week.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So there's no excuses, I'll have to take em to Totton I'll book now<FONT COLOR=RED> ;-)</font></P><FONT COLOR=RED>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">A bacon chop for breakfast, Mac approves, Do you think I could get one
too ?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Douwe Egberts for me and Hampshire Water for Mac.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At least he's not asking for a walk. Hey come ba...........</P>
