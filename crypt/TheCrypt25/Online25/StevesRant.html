<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>So why do you need to know `A bit more about me`, well, this small article

is basically aimed at those who may of not heard of Dr Jekyll, which in this

circle seems unlikely, but quite possible, if the police in Rugby (where I

live) have heard about me, you can bet your bottom dollar that most people

on the Amiga scene especially have heard of yours truly.</I></P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Most of this will be in the section called `History` which is any issue of

our mag, so, if for any reason you haven`t seen or read it, then here we

go......</I></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I got onto the Amiga scene around about 1980 having thought at the time

about going over to then Atari St, and just then coming over from a Spectrum

128k + 3 and an Amstrad 6128, one of my contacts either gave my name &

address to Ray Hawkins (Dungeon Master-the main founder member of The Crypt)

or it might have been my name was given to Ray H, anyway, it was supposedly

said that either or both of us were pretty good contacts, so we made

contact.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a few weeks of writing to each other I finally decided to phone him,

and from our first phone call we go on like old mates, we had a crack, but

the respect was and has always been there towards each other, and it`s still

the same nowadays even though he`s left us, he has and always will be a

bloody good mate and a very very reliable contact, and very trustworthy.....</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were both on different computers at the time, but we both were seriously

thinking about going over to the Amiga, ray started the ball rolling first

by getting an Amiga 500, so a few weeks later I got my first-ever A500, by

which time he`d manage to get a 500+, a few weeks later I got a 500+, then a

few weeks later he went from an A600 up to an A1200, I was still stuck with

the A500+ for a few months because cash was so bloody tight, but I managed

to get an A1200 eventually, but all that to-ing & fro-ing with Ray in the

lead most of the time soon changed, I got my act together and started to

upgrade my A1200 big time, well, it was then.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, that`s how we first met, after a few months on the miggy scene Ray

came up with the idea of us starting our own computer mag, which I said

"Brill", and decided to call it "Bits `n` Bytes", and it was a purely WB

orientated diskmag, very limited, then I managed to read about a Diskmag

creator aptly called DMC, which we changed over to and kept, then left alone

and eventually went back to for some time, until we finally got the brains

of Steve Evans onboard who created our web version which in turn made it

possible for us to post our mag on "The Net", which was the best thing that

ever happened to us and the mag, staying as a "Disk-only" mag kept our

readers figures to a low number really, but being net-based, soon saw us in

every country where a user had a computer and was on the net.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, about June of 2001 my wife died, my head was screwed up (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>OK.. ferret,

I knows it`s always been the same, ha ha, very bloody funny</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), anyway, I was

so screwed-up after 17 or so years of marriage, that I decided to leave TC

and possibly leave the computer scene in general, but I didn`t leave the

scene, I took a few months off, then I got back on my computer and done the

odd article for TC but nothing on a regular basis, at this time though with

Ian Fyvie (Ferret, ex member of another diskmag called The Rippper) and Ray

Hawkins taking over, well asking if it would be ok for then to take over the

jobs as Editor-Ray H & Ian as Co-editor I took on the job as Staff-writer

with a couple of other guys, but resigned my position to try to get my head

sorted out, I`m still trying...<I>snigger snigger</I>.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ray & Ian suggested that I took time to get over my trouble and come back as

whatever when I was good and ready, so for many months I hardly sent in any

stuff to then or our new (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>then</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) webmaster Steve Evans, but I finally started

to do the odd article here and there, then I met my last girlfriend, Clara,

a gorgeous 21-year old Black South African girl, very sexy, she moved in

with me (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>I`m 51 years old, getting slowly towards 52</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>), we lived together for

6 months in which time she bled me dry with money, although she was working,

I was paying all the bills and buying food for the two of us while she was

having fun with her mates and managing to squeeze me in to come and stay the

night on Wednesdays & Sundays, which was very kind of her (<I>huh</I>).</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, we had major problems, I was soon taking a possible 2nd place or

possibly a third place in her life, we started to row and fight, she did no

work at home, cooking or cleaning, she was continuously leaving the place in

a pig-sty stay when she left for work each day at about 1.15pm, while I had

been at work from about 8.00 am, so after a bad row and a fight one

Wednesday night, I told her to pack her stuff and to F&*k off, she did, and

that was the last I ever saw of her, we phoned each other for about 3 weeks

after we broke up because I wanted us to still friends, and I was greeted

with "yeh, ok love, I`ll try and pop over next Wednesday if Nolene (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><I>that`s

her m8</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and me aren`t too drunk or busy, if not I`ll see whenever.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said in that case after all that I`ve done for you, please stay away and

never phone me again, of course I was greeted with loads of abuse, so I gave

her the same back and that was about 7 weeks ago, I still love & miss her,

but since we broke up I`ve been slowly getting not only my hearted re-sorted

out again, but my financies, ok, so I`m skint most of the time, but my

freezer and food cupboards are full most of the time, they spent months

nearly empty, I`ve managed to get myself a PC, OK, so not a brill one, but

adequate for me at present, the new GeForce graphics card is probably the

first ever graphics card that I`ve ever bought for any of my computers, well

worth the £40 or thereabouts.
</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I`ve also just recently managed to get my phone re-connected and to go

`online`, and my email address is <A HREF="mailto:steven.hyde2@btopenworld.com">steven.hyde2@btopenworld.com.</A></P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ok, I still love and miss her, but we couldn`t never go back to how we used

to be and feel the same way about each other, I also found out that she was

messing about with others blokes behind my back, but at last for a few

months in my life I can honestly say that this old geezer has had a 21 black

girl for a girlfriend, how many guys can say that..</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, that`s enough about me, I dare say most of you know most of this,

but being `online` for my first time I contacted Steve Evans and Ian Fyvie

and a couple of the other lads, told them my email address, and was asked if

I`d like to come back as a Staff Writer, I had to think about it though, but

I finally said "yes", so here I am, you poor devils..</P>.



<P ALIGN="LEFT">More articles to come ASAP, U can B sure of that folks....(Dr Jekyll)</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If any of the none-regular contacts of mine wish to ever chat to me over the

phone then you can do so on Rugby (01788-570198 most nights after 6.00 pm or

most weekends.....tara4 now (<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><I>Steve.P.Hyde</I><FONT COLOR=AQUA>)
