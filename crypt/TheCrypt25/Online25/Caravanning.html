<P ALIGN="LEFT">Okeh.  You've hitched up, you've locked the house, got the kids and the
missus in the car, and you're ready for the off.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But just where are you off to?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are still some sites that accept the occasional 'weekend gypsy', but
it's so much nicer to plan ahead and book a site.  Site managers prefer it,
and some demand it!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, what are you looking for?  Do you want a quiet site with just the bare
essentials, or do you want everything done for you?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">What kind of site is there?  They are as varied as you want them to be,
ranging from a farmers field, to a super-site with bars, clubhouses and
access to all sorts of other entertainments.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Family sites cater for adults and children, and usually pets.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Adult sites usually only cater for over 18's, ie children are not
welcomed, and usually neither are pets.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Rally sites usually just supply the site sometimes with a toilet (<FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>or
well-cut thistles</I>!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and a water supply, somewhere!  This is when you need
your own toilet and washing facilities!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you join the Caravan Club (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>CC<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) or the Caravan and Camping Club (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>CCC<FONT COLOR=AQUA>),
you will be offered access to sites that non-members don't, and also price
reductions too.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of their sites are called CL (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>Certified Locations<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and many generally
only have licences for up to 5 units.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some sites do not accept single-sex groups.  Let's face it, if you were on
holiday, would you want the boys from tent A fighting with the boys from
tent B over the girls in tent C?  Or even the boys in tent A fighting with
the girls in tent C over the boys from tent B?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Having said that, on previous occasions, I have contacted 'no single-sex'
sites asking if I can visit with my 9-year-old son, and encountered no
problems!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">9 times out of ten, the lady of the house doesn't get much of a break, as
there's still washing up and a certain amount of housework to do.  Even if
the rest of the family mucks in and gives the lady a hand, there's still
plenty to do!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I've heard of people that scour jumble sales for old clothes to buy, so
they take those, wear them, and bin them afterwards!  You could also take
paper plates and disposable cutlery.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But, basically, if you want a holiday where you'll be waited on hand and
foot, you'll be in a hotel.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But, I digress, where were we?  Ah yes, where are we going!  Just for the
sake of it, I'm going to put in some info about a couple of sites that I
know about, and then, delve into me sites book and find a couple more.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><CENTER><I>The Old Station Caravan Site, Fangfoss, York.</I></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This site is based in the old railway station at Fangfoss.  There are
around 120 pitches for tents, caravans, and motorhomes.  Of these, 60 or so
are hard-standing (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>gravel<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and the remainder are grass.  Each hard-standing
is big enough for a caravan, awning and the car, and the grass area is not
marked out.  This means that if a group travel together with a collection
of tents and caravans, they can all pitch near to each other.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most pitches have EHU (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>Electric Hook-Ups<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and you'll only have to pass two
pitches before you find a water stand-pipe.  There is a single
toilet/shower block, with hot water 24/7.  Opposite the toilet block is a
laundry room with washer, dryer and iron.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The site shop sells eggs, bacon, sausages, milk, basic cereals, a few
tinned foods, maps, tin-openers (guess who left ours at home!) and a few
souvenirs.  There is a Post Office in the village, a mile or so away.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is also a nice pub a couple of miles away, which serves some good bar
meals as well as the Falling Down Juice (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>FDJ<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At night, the site is well lit, but the lights aren't obtrusive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The centre of York is about 8 miles away.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This is an odd site.  The site itself is quiet, and runs beside a fairly
fast country road.  If you have young children, you'll have to watch them
carefully, because of that road.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The entire site is flat, and there are many trees that can be parked under,
giving welcome shade during the hotter months.  But, you may have to spend
some time cleaning the roof of the 'van!  Also, there will be the dawn
chorus.  What this will sound like directly above at 4 in the morning is
probably left to the imagination!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All 60 pitches are grass, and some have EHU's.  There is a toilet/shower
block with hot water most of the day.  There is a small site shop
supplying the essentials.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Thurston village is about a mile away, and has two pubs, a filling station,
post office, vet, bakery, hotel (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>excellent food<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and recently opened chip
shop.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Four miles away is Pakenham, with its two working mills, one wind and one
water.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Beyton is a mile or so in the opposite direction to Thurston, and has a
couple of nice pubs, and a big village green that may be picnicked on.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The historic town of Bury St Edmunds is about 8 miles distant, and boasts
many fine eating and drinking establishments, museums, Abbey Gardens,
cathedral, and Sports Centre.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Without going into town, the night-life consists mainly of bats, owls, and
small woodland creatures.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Recently (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>1998/99 season<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) upgraded to include hard standings - some 20/25
pitches.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from one corner, all pitches are level side to side and will need
very little correction fore and aft. The remainder of the seventy five
pitches are grassed and well drained. The quieter pitches (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>grass<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) are to
the left as one enters the site, the remainder of the grass pitches are in
the centre of the site. These are only really used when the site becomes
full or nearly full, so there is plenty of room to manoeuvre on and off
pitches.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The hard standings can prove a bit tight, for manoeuvring, if you have a
large outfit of car and caravan but it is not excessively so. The pitches
are wide enough for a large TA + car + awning, so there's no excuse for
creating ruts in the grassy areas between pitches.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is one toilet block maintained to the CCs high standards. The usual
vegetable preparation area, chemical disposal point.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Wardens for the past three years, George and Norma, are welcoming and
have a good knowledge of the area. They will be able to inform you of local
events and some of the best places to eat in the near vicinity. The nearest
is Scott Skinners Restaurant & Pub, which is within a reasonable walking
distance.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">George and Norma are proud of the site and work hard to keep it that way
for the members. They do not take kindly to people who are inconsiderate of
others, but at the same time, will not interfere where it's not needed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both propane & butane gas can be bought along with milk, orange juice and
various ices. Rolls and newspapers can be ordered from the Wardens on site.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The city of Aberdeen is within 30 minutes drive from the site, try the
beaches in summer, or winter if you like 'wild'! There is a permanent
funfair at the beach along with good eating places. The city is not cheap
(<FONT COLOR=WHITE>on par with London<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) so be prepared!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Banchory is the closest village/town & this is only a ten minute drive from
the site. The walk along the river is recommended and the Wardens will
point the way. Try to visit the bridge when the River Dee is high and watch
the peaty waters hurtle under the bridge.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The site is ideally placed for seeing both Royal Deeside and the North East
of Scotland with the Whisky Trial within comfortable distance.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Braemar Gathering is the highlight of the year on Deeside with members
of the Royal family paying a short visit to hand out the prizes. There are
usually 200/300 Bandsmen & women and several reels of film are recommended!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you can find it - free whisky can be obtained! Contact AndyG nearer the time for more information!</P>

Directions. From the south.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">1.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> Turn off at signs for Fettercairn - follow the signs for there - then
follow signs for Banchory. Not a road for the faint-hearted. Hilly and
twisty with locals using it quite a lot!</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

Directions. From the south.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">2. <FONT COLOR=AQUA>Turn off just prior to Stonehaven and follow the signs for Banchory.
This is not too bad a road but it does contain a bridge with near 90 degree
turns at either end.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

Directions. From all directions.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">3.<FONT COLOR=AQUA> To Aberdeen to roundabout - take first exit (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>don't go over the bridge<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) -
then follow signs for Lower Deeside Road (<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>B9077<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) - follow straight through
until 'T' junction - Turn right - to next 'T' junction - turn left - follow
road (<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>A93<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) towards Banchory - site on left *immediately* past the BP
filling station. Of the three this is by far the easiest!</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">(Editor note) <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>Andy comments that this route is by far the easier. The Lower
Deeside Road is a lot quieter, even in the rush hour, than the Upper
Deeside Road. Directions.</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA>From the North East<BR>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><P ALIGN="LEFT">4.<FONT COLOR=AQUA>- to Aberdeen - follow signs for Dundee & South - keep straight on until
the 7th roundabout across the bridge - turn right onto Lower Deeside Road
(<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>B9077<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and follow directions (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>3<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) above.</font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An alternative, scenic, route from Perth is to follow signs for Braemar.
This road will take you through some spectacular scenery, especially in
winter, but it is a hard road for caravanners - if in doubt - don't try it.
This takes you up to Glenshee and down the other side into Braemar and then
along to Banchory and Silverbank. Just stay on the road, do not turn off
and you will eventually come to Silverbank.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>An update on Silverbank:</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As of this season (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>2002<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) Silverbank is now all hard standings.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The newer ones are to the inside of the site.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I predict there will be problems for some tuggers with big TAs as the road
around the site is rather narrow. Should you wish to make it easier for
yourself, ask the Warden if he will assign you (<FONT COLOR=WHITE><B>NOT</B> book!! because he
won't!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) one of the 'corner' pitches and explain the size of your outfit.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Trees have been planted in the middle but will take a few years to mature,
as will the plants which have also been put in.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is also an extra chemical disposal point in the larger area of the
site (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>to the right as you enter<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Three WCs, four showers and five shaving cubicles - pointless going before
ten am when the site's busy!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You will experience the sound of the reversing bleeper from the timber yard
next to the site, unavoidable.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Still a nice pleasant site and handy for Royal Deeside, Aberdeen and points
north.</P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The site is situated within 20 minutes walk of Delft and we really enjoyed
our 10 days there last year.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is a large site with an area set aside for static's owned by Dutch
residents and also several static's for Eurocamp (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>they also have tents
erected there<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pitches are level and the ones for vans and motorhomes are
semi-hardstanding, 2 or 3 units with plenty of space between on pitches
which are separated by hedges. There is ample space for tents too.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We parked the motorhome up for 10 days and used public transport to get
around, it was nice for Graeme to have a break from driving after 2 weeks
in England and with another week to get down to St Malo for our return to
Jersey.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The site has a good information point, a well stocked shop a decent size
pool and kiddies pool, play area etc</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A restaurant, take away and bar with good food and friendly service. There
is ample entertainment laid on for children too. Most important is that it
is quiet after 10pm. The toilets and showers (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>including disabled<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) are first
class and thoroughly cleaned every day. Water points are ample and rubbish
is deposited into shutes which take it to underground containers. There is
a chemical disposal point and refill point for water tanks.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Loads to see and do from this site, a lake closeby with a small beach area,
loads of interesting walks and of course the inimitable cycle paths.
Wildlife abounds on site with rabbits, ducks and moorhens all calling round
for breakfast!! The rabbits love McVities wholemeal!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Catch the bus into Delft (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>better than trying to find a parking space<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) Two
markets weekly, a large one Thursdays where you can taste all the cheeses
etc., and a smaller one of Saturdays which also has a variety of 'bric a
brac' stalls. Plenty of places to eat in Delft but we recommend Cafe de
Waag, the food here is excellent and inexpensive. Some of the corner cafes
are good also but you can get quite 'high' depending on which one you
frequent and that applies to non smokers as well!!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Visits to Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Den Haag and Scheveningen are a must
whether by your own transport or by public, if you are using your own
transport then don't forget Kinderdijk and the windmills - its time stood
still!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We could ramble on for hours about this site, we enjoyed our stay so much
and we are returning this year!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We visited this site as part of a CCC rally at Easter, and it is situated
about 15 min walk from Delft town centre. Delft itself is only 15-20 miles
from Hook of Holland ferry port.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The site is in partial woodland with around 300 pitches all good size. The
site does back onto a fairly large lake.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Restaurant, bar, shop, kids play area, and a modest size swimming pool all
on site.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Delft town centre as I mentioned before is a 15 min walk away or 5 mins on
the regular bus service that stops outside the site. You can buy a strip of
bus tickets (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>recommened<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) from reception. It is is very pretty town to
visit, home of course to the Delft pottery which we thought was very
expensive!!!!</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Other tourist places are Rotterdam 30 m The Hague 7 miles with a superb
beach nearby, but I have forgotten it's name.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amsterdam is about 40 miles away so we caught the train which took about 35
mins.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We drove to the Keukenhof gardens (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>open march-may<FONT COLOR=AQUA>) and made a day of it, we
drove back via sea route.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We stopped on this site for 6 nights and I found this was just not long
enough to see everything.</P></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm pleased to read you enjoyed Delftse Hout Mick.  We have stayed there
the last three years, we park up the camper and use the efficient public
transport (<FONT COLOR=WHITE>gives Graeme a break from driving!<FONT COLOR=AQUA>)  The name of the beach
resort by Den Haag is Scheveningen - definitely worth a visit, there is a
special ticket for the bus/tram you can buy at reception, it costs 15
guilders and allows up to 5 people to take a return trip there - darn good
value for money.  They also have static's to rent and grass bungalows.</font></font></P>
