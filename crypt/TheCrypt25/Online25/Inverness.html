<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inverness is an excellent touring centre with good road,  rail and
air  connections.  With its suspension bridges  across  the  River
Ness and old stone buildings,  it is a pretty place which is well-
known for its floral displays.  In fact it won the 1996 award  for
Best  Large Town in the Bloom of Britain competition.  In December
2000,  it was one of only 3 towns to be awarded city status by the
Queen.   The  official ceremony took place on 19  March  2001  and
celebrations  were held in July around the time of  the  Inverness
Highland Games.  The local population is about 42,000 in the  city
plus another 20,000 in the district.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Walk  down  along  the  river  banks <FONT COLOR=SILVER> (in  the  direction  of  the
Caledonian Canal)</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA>  and you'll find the Ness Islands where you  can
escape  from the hustle and bustle of the shops.  Cross the  river
on  the  little  bridges and you can visit Bught Park.   Close  by
between the ice rink and the sports centre is the Floral Hall -  a
sub-tropical  horticultural  extravaganza  with  small  waterfall,
fish  and alsorts of plants/trees,<FoNT COLOR=SILVER> (open all year round)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.  Entrance
fee  only £1.20.  I particularly like the cactus hall  -  quite  a
surprise!   Walking up the river in the other  direction <FONT COLOR=SILVER> (towards
the  harbour) <FONT COLOR=AQUA> you will see Ben Wyvis on the skyline.</font></font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>






<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inverness  has  an  excellent museum and art gallery  between  the
castle and the tourist office.  Open 9am-5pm,  Monday-Saturday all
year.   Includes gift shop and coffee shop.  Local  history  talks
take place here on the first Wednesday evening of each month.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eden  Court  Theatre,   situated near the cathedral,   has  events
listings throughout the year for drama,  music and cinema.   Built
in the 1970s,  it incorporates part of the old Bishop's Palace and
is  said to be haunted by the 'Green Lady' ghost of a wife of  one
of the bishop's who hanged herself there.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  other  place  to see films<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (movies) <FONT COLOR=AQUA> is at  the  multi-screen
Warner  cinema complex just outside city centre off the main  road
heading  to  Aberdeen.  Also check out  art.tm  which  is  an  art
gallery and studio on the riverside at 20 Bank Street<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (open  11am-
6pm,   Tuesday-Saturday)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.  The Spectrum Centre by the bus  station
has  a  cafe  and  is the meeting place for many local  clubs  and
education classes.  Look out for Scottish Showtime music and dance
performances during the summer.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inverness has 3 golf courses <FONT COLOR=SILVER>(Inverness Golf Club,  Loch Ness Golf
Course  &  Torvean Golf Club.  Soccer fans might be interested  in

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inverness  Castle was built on the site of an earlier fortress  in
1835  and  sits  on a low cliff overlooking the river.   Today  it
houses  the Sherriffs Court.  Take Castle Street which  winds  its
way  up  around the rear of the castle and past some pretty floral
displays  to get to the statue of Flora MacDonald.  At the  Castle
Garrison  Encounter you can journey back in time to 1745,   enlist
in  the  Regiment  and  meet some of its  other  characters  live.
Visits  take  about  40 minutes:  open daily  during  the  tourist
season from 10.30am to 5.30pm.<FONT COLOR=WHITE>  Tel:  01463 243 363 / Fax:   01463
710 755.<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  A piper plays every evening from June to start September
from 7pm to 7.30pm on the Castle Hill.</font></font></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  thought  that   11th-century   castle  which  featured  in
Shakepeare's  play  Macbeth<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (even though there  is  no  historical
evidence to suggest that it was where Duncan I was murdered) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>  was
in  fact located to the east of the present castle<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (in what is now
Auldcastle Road)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.  Originally built of wood,  it was replaced by a
fortress  of  stone on Castle Hill.  Apparently  there  have  been
sightings of the ghost of King Duncan walking along the  banks  of
the River Ness in full regalia.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  the  opposite  bank of the river is Saint  Andrew's  Cathedral
<FONT COLOR=SILVER>(minus  its  spires  as the funds ran out  before  they  could  be
completed)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>.  The font is a copy of Thorwalden's font in Copenhagen
Cathedral.   Look  out for the Russian gold icons.   Concerts  and
organ  recitals are held.  The teashop in the old  schoolhouse  is
open  from  March  to  September Monday  to  Saturday  10.30am  to
3.30pm.   From here you can walk down the river banks and  explore
the Ness Islands.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many old houses in the city centre dating from the  16th
and 17th centuries.  Built in 1791,  the Steeple on the corner  of
Bridge Street and Church Street used to be the steeple of the  old
jail.  Opposite,  on the corner of Bridge Street and Castle Street
is  the  Town  House,   an  interesting 19th century  Gothic-style
building.
Although it is used as local government offices,  you can  have  a
little look around - go inside and admire the fancy staircase.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cromwell's Clock Tower in Shore Street is all that remains of  the
large  citadel  built between 1652 and 1657 by  Oliver  Cromwell's
Commonwealth  Army.   Now  part of the ever  expanding  industrial
estate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However much the City of Inverness has to offer the Visitor, No excursion to the Area would be complete without a visit to the fameous battle field on the outskirts of Inverness and subject of our next article..... </P>
