<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<CENTER>It was in the year of 1942,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was lucky I had a job to do.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Taxi driver was my occupation,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Thought it would be for the duration.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There were not many cars on the road,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Rugby was the place of my abode.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>One day a letter was delivered to me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It was an invitation from the Air Ministry.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>I had to report to Coventry, Sibree Hall,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For the purpose of having my medical.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Everything went according to plan,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Evidently I was a fit enough man.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>I had reached the great age of nineteen,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A lot of the world I had not seen.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>I was passed fit, with the grade of 'A',</CENTER>
<CENTER>Which really did make my day.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Some weeks later my papers came,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was to be of Royal Air Force fame.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The papers told me exactly what to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>What to take, and where to go.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Cardigan was to be my destination,</CENTER>
<CENTER>So I had to pack in my occupation.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>On Mon Sept 10th, with my case all packed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Down to Rugby Station I tracked.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>With ticket in hand I boarded the train,</CENTER>
<CENTER>At Northampton I had to get off again.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>A train for Bedford was my next aim,</CENTER>
<CENTER>More chaps with suitcases just the same.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>In came the train and we all piled in,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Everybody as clean as new pins.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>At Bedford station, the train came to a halt,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Just then I suppose we all felt like doing a bolt.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We stepped off the train and out into the road,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There were troop-carrying QLs there waiting to load.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>We were herded aboard like cattle on a ship,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The only thing missing was the man with the whip.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Up the road out of Bedford we went,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Curious to see where we were being sent.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>In through some big gates the lorries steered,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I wondered why nobody cheered?.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>"Come on you lot, line up over here."</CENTER>
<CENTER>I think we did it more out of fear.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>All these young men all spick & span,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Being controlled by just one man.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>He was a corporal with a fierce glower,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Wondering what to do with this new shower.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/SARGE2.GIF" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="sarge.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>"Any questions?" He roared as he paced up and down,</CENTER>
<CENTER>His face grimaced with a very fiery frown.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>One brave lad with a tongue in his head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"When do we get some leave," he said.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The corporal didn't seem at all put out,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He'd heard it all before no doubt.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We all thought it was one huge joke,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And tried to congratulate the bloke.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The laughing soon stopped when the corporal gave a shout,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We soon found out what the RAF was all about.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Our huts were allocated and to them we were sent,</CENTER>
<CENTER>On some faces were looks of discontent.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It didn't take long to get things sorted out,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The main thing was the cookhouse without a doubt.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>It seemed rather strange the first night away from home,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All shut up in a camp and not allowed to roam.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The next day dawned all bright and fair,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There were crowds of men everywhere.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We all got measured up for our clothes and shoes,</CENTER>
<CENTER>They were given to us, we could not choose.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>A hut full of men, we didn't know who was who,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Now we were all dressed in Air Force blue.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Of course in a crowd it is a well known fact,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There is a mixture of comedy and fact.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There are some who think they know it all,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And there are some who know nothing at all.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>I suppose the latter is the best one to be,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Because it seemed to make life easy.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>It was best to let the RAF tell you what to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Instead of doing what you wanted to do.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We were given a number which you didn't forget,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Because if you did, no money would you get.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Mine was 1641403,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And it has been forever in my memory.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>We were shown how it was best to pack our kit bags,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But of course, there were always some snags.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Your wellies, of course they went in first,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But if you wanted them first, that was the worst.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>To arrange your blankets was a technical job,</CENTER>
<CENTER>'O yes' and we all had to get the king's bob.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It all was very interesting and it kept us amused,</CENTER>
<CENTER>At least none of us was being abused.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>One day some of us, to the MT section were directed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was one of the few that were selected.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>It seemed strange to be back on the road once more,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Although I had never driven a lorry before.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>We were taken around the streets of Bedford town,</CENTER>
<CENTER>No wonder the inhabitants were wearing a frown.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>All these young lads chasing round and round,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It would make them feel like going to ground.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There were no mishaps as far as I could say,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But all of us were eager to be on our way.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>I have been through Bedford many times over the years,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It brings back memories but not many tears.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There doesn't seem room now for the learner DMT's,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I bet population will be very pleased.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Things seemed OK and everything went well.</CENTER>
<CENTER>At least as far as I could tell.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>One day we were honoured with the spud-bashing job,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Never thought it would take so many to feed the mob.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There was talk of us leaving, but we knew not where,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There were always rumours around in the air.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>At last the morning came and we packed our kit,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Down to the station to carry it.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Once aboard the train it was better, I must confess,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The Gen men said we were going to Skegness,</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Away we went like kids on a treat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We all thought - this couldn't be beat.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>As those great hangars faded away out of sight,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We all wondered what would be our plight.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The Gen men were right, it was Skegness town,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We couldn't see many holiday-makers around.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>We got off the train and lined up in the park,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We certainly were not for a lark.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Another corporal there was pacing up and down,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He certainly did look nice and brown.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>His uniform was faded but it was a nice fit,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He looked as if he had been poured into it.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>He paced up and down and looked at the front line,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He said "The first  thing  you'll  do  is  get  a hair-cut like mine."</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>He whipped off his cap and to our horror did see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>his hair had been cut very, very closely.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/SARGE1.GIF" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="sarge1.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>When he saw our faces it really made him smile,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I suppose the funniest thing he had seen for a while.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There were lads with blond, ginger, brown and black.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A lot of it all hanging down our back.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The barber did not have to ask what to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He cut all the same, for me and for you.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>We were allocated our digs, which were facing the sea,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The landlady's name was Mrs Ashley.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>No 7, Grand Parade was the proper address,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A very nice lodgings, I must impress.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Unfortunately now it doesn't exist,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Two or three places there have been demolished.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>My room mate came from Rusthall, Tunbridge Wells,</CENTER>
<CENTER>His name was Bill Plass and we were quite good pals.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Inoculation was one thing that was on the list,</CENTER>
<CENTER>One of the things we would like to have missed.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>We all lined up with our sleeves rolled up high,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Hoping that they would pass us by.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>'Don't look at the man in the front,` we were told,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But as you may guess we thought we were bold.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>I and some others took no notice of that,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The next thing we knew we were flat on the mat.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>These were the men who were supposed to be brave and true,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who were going to win the war for you.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We were told we would have an FFI,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We soon found out that it was nothing to do with your eye.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>'Right you lot, line up over there,</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Drop your trousers and leave yourself bare'.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER> It must have been a hilarious sight,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Enough to give everyone a horrible fright.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>When we first arrived we saw squads of men,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Marching up and down again.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We never thought we would be down the same,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Square-bashing they called it, that was it's name.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>I often wondered where the transport would be,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But as it happened, unfortunately.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There was six weeks of marching and various things,</CENTER>
<CENTER>That we would suffer, us humble beings.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/SOLDIER4.GIF" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="sol.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>There was a sergeant in charge of our gang,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And when he shouted, the echoes rang.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>With his pace stick and polished boots,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We were marched round various routes.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Left-right, Left-right was all we used to hear,</CENTER>
<CENTER>At least to us that`s what it did appear.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>`Heep hipe, heep hipe,` is what he used to shout,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But at least we deciphered what it was all about.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>For one poor lad in our squad, it really was a shame,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He couldn`t help it, he really wasn`t to blame.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>When the order was given `By the left, quick march,`</CENTER>
<CENTER>He moved as if he was stiffened by starch.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>As his left foot went forward, so did his left arm,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Which in the middle of a squad, caused quite a bit of harm.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>To us it was quite funny, but not to the serge,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We though he was going to put the poor lad on a charge.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The thought the found the answer, or so it did appear,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The gave him the order to march in the rear.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>That went quite well, until the order `About turn,`</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of course there was chaos, like a filed of waving corn.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>I don`t know what happened to him, but on him we could depend,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For when the going got quite nasty, he was a good secret weapon.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The corporal that I mentioned was quite a nice fellow,</CENTER>
<CENTER>He wasn`t the sort of chap to shout, bawl or bellow.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It there was a chance to help you, he would if he could,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It wasn`t very often that you saw him in a bad mood.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It was said that in civvy street he was a London bus conductor,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But in the RAF he was a PT instructor.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>I often wondered if he, by chance, is still anywhere around,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It would be nice to see if he could be found.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Whilst out on a march one day, miles out of town,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The weather was very nice, the sun was shining down.</CENTER>
 
<CENTER>Everybody seemed to be in a very good mood,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Everything was going well I suppose it should.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It so happened in the distance a café we could see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We all hoped that Cpl Morrison would let us have a cup of tea.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Our hopes were granted, he said, `OK chaps, have a break,`</CENTER>
<CENTER>So we all piled in the café for a cup of tea and some cake.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>Then we all came outside to enjoy the fresh air,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Which was all very welcome to everybody there.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>One of the lads, I know not his name,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or of the district whence he came.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Sat himself upon a low wall,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And proceeded to serenade to one and all.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The actual song he sang was Blues In The Night,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To everyone there it caused great delight.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It seemed like a scene from one of the shows,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Wherever he went to Skeggy, goodness knows.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>One day in the ranks news got around,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The next day we were Ingoldmels bound.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>There was only one snag attached to this rumour,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And it didn`t cause a great deal of humour.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>That a forced march was the order for the very next day,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Just was it entailed they didn`t care to say.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We got up next morning full of the joys of spring,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Out on parade ready for anything.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>After dinner we marched to the northside of town,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When the told us the order we all had a frown.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Instead of the usual casual marching pace,</CENTER>
<CENTER>This was to be a double-time race.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Evidently everybody had to do it whilst they were there,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It might have been because of the fresh air.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Off we went on our merry way,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Everybody soon got in the sway.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The first two three miles, they weren`t too bad,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When we got to Ingolmels we were very glad.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>We thought we were going to have a rest,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But no, the NCO`s thought it would be best,</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>For us to about turn and retrace our steps,</CENTER>
<CENTER>They said it would do the world of good for our biceps,</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>`Left right, left right, `we could hear them shout,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It was lucky non of us dropped out.</CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER>My God, how it made us perspire,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It also felt as though our feet were on fire.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>At last we could see the end was in sight,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We would have been in no condition to fight.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>At the north end of Skeggy there was a big patch of grass,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Where we all lay like a writhing mass.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>It must have been quite funny for anyone to see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All the fit young men groaning in agony.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>At last the day came for us to depart,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The day that we longed for right from the start.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>The previous night we all went for a drink,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A good time was had by all, I think?.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Cpl Morrison was present and we said our goodbye`s,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As he shook hands there were tears in our eyes.</CENTER>
 <BR>
<CENTER>Weather he was sad to see us all go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or weather he was glad we will never know</CENTER>
