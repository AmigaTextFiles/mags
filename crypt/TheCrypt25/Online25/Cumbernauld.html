<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite  its  title  of  a New Town,  Cumbernauld  can  trace  its
history back two centuries and more,  having been built around  an
old  estate  and  an  18th  century laird's  house  complete  with
picturesque park.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  last  200  years have seen a steady growth in  that  original
estate and today Cumbernauld is a significant community acting  as
an  overspill  for  people   living   in  Glasgow  and  Edinburgh.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  original settlement here may have taken place in Roman  times
under the shelter of the Antonine Wall.  By the early Middle  Ages
the  settlement must have grown to a respectable size  to  warrant
the Comyns placing their chapel here.  With the Flemings' decision
to  build their castle and make Cumbernauld their principal  seat,
the  place  would assume its present form which is  the  classical
layout  of  a  medieval Scottish town,  with its principal  street
running from castle to church. Cumbernauld Old Parish Church</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  ancient  building owes its foundations to the  early  chapel
built  by the Comyns at the end of the twelfth century.   A  brief
notice  appears  on  record in 1500 when  Cumbernauld  like  other
places in Britain at this time,  was badly hit by the plague - the
notorious  Black Death.  The Village population was  so  decimated
that  the  surviving inhabitants had great difficulty in  carrying
the  bodies for burial to the parish cemetery at the old  kirk  of
St  Ninian's  in  Kirkintilloch,  so a successful application  was
made  to  the See of Glasgow for permission to open a  new  burial
ground "at the Chapel in Cumbernauld".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In  the  churchyard,  the oldest visible headstone is dated  1654.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  fine  building is an excellent example of the  neo-classical
type  of  architecture as practised by the fashionable  architect,
William Adam, in the first half of the eighteenth century. </P>







<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  primary  building  is a great rectangular  block,   having  a
central  main portion projecting both frontally and to  the  rear;
the  frontal  portion  is  surmounted by  a  classical  triangular
pediment  containing the Fleming coat-of-arms,  the  rear  portion
takes  the form of a bay carrying pedimented windows.  The central
window pediment on the first floor carries the completion  date  -
1731. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  district  of the New Town is based on a much  older  village
dating  from at least the 17th Century and is part of  the  Parish
of  Cumbernauld.  By the nineteenth century,  it had  grown  to  a
sufficient  size to warrant the establishment of  its  own  church
manse,  founded in 1875,  and still in use.  Like Cumbernauld,  it
was  a  weaving community and there still exists a number of  late
18th and early 19th century,  single-storey,  weavers' houses such
as those in the row known as Braehead Cottages.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the West end of the village is Dalshannon Farm.  This farmhouse
is  the  best example in the District of a "longhouse",   of  17th
century date.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  development of the village of Dullatur was due to the Glasgow
to  Edinburgh  Railway  which,  in  1876,   opened  a  station  to
encourage Glasgow commuters to move to the district.  Prior to the
station  there had been a small group of houses and  two  examples
of the older dwellings are Dullatur House,  of 18th century origin
and  East Dullatur House,  which was built around the 1800's.  The
commuters  caused  the 'Dullatur Villas' to  be  constructed  and,
along  with  the land on which they were built,  the  village  was
designated a Conservation Area.  Two of these villas,  Dunluce and
Woodend  in Prospect Road,  are of particular interest since  both
were  designed by Alexander 'Greek' Thomson,  who has  many  other
examples of classic Greek styling in the Glasgow area.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dullatur,   'Dubh  Leitir' or 'Dark Hill Slope',   has  long  been
associated  with  local history,  especially  the  Antonine  Wall.
Built  by Lullius Urbicus,  The Governor of Britain in AD  142  on
the  orders of Emperor Antonius Pius,  it passed to the  north  of
the  present  Cumbernauld  on the north  slope  of  the  ridge  at
Dullatur.   A  Roman  camp at Dullatur,  actually  under  Dullatur
House,   one of the primary forts at Castlecary and the  secondary
forts  at  Westerwood and Croy Hill were all occupied by  the  2nd
and  6th  Legions.  The legionnaires kept guard at these far-flung
and  most  northerly  outposts  of  the  Roman  Empire,   scanning
northwards  across  the Kelvin Valley to  the  Kilsyth  Hills  and
beyond,  ever watchful and aware of possible surprise attacks from
the wild northern Picts.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Cumbernauld is one of the New Towns built in Britain after World War Two, intended as a solution to the country's chronic housing problem. Situated around a hilltop ridge thirteen miles east of Glasgow, it is Britain's most concrete example of a modernist utopian town.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> In 1945, the newly-elected Labour government set up The New Towns Committee, which was tasked with planning a solution to urban congestion and squalid inner-city housing conditions. Each of the New Towns was to be an independent community with the population drawn from the overcrowded and unhealthy cities.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">In the Committee's first report to the Government, the scale of their vision for the future is clear; "It is not enough in our handiwork to avoid the mistakes and omissions of the past. Our responsibility, as we see it, is rather to conduct an essay on civilisation, by seizing an opportunity to design, evolve and carry into execution for the benefit of coming generations the means for a happy and gracious way of life."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The New Town of Cumbernauld was designated on December 9th 1955. The original plan called for the creation of a town capable of accommodating 50,000- 80,000 people, the majority of whom would come from Glasgow. It was one of the last New Towns designated in Britain, and the one in which modernist theories of town-planning are most obvious.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The site for Cumbernauld was relatively small, meaning that population density would be higher than in other New Towns. The town's planners were keen to give their creation a more 'urban' feel than its predecessors, so this was not considered a hindrance.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The first Chief Architect Hugh Wilson assembled a team of planners and designers from all corners of the world. They considered themselves to be part of a pioneering experiment in urban planning, and for years their fellow architects and planners travelled to Cumbernauld to study this bold utopia on a windy hilltop in central Scotland.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The original Plan for Cumbernauld envisaged a single multi-purpose town centre surrounded by high-density neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods would not have their own retail centres (as in other New Towns), but would instead be connected to the main centre by pedestrian footpaths.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Residents would be able to walk safely to and from the centre without ever coming across a car: a giant motorway system catered for those who wanted to drive through the town or to the centre. This revolutionary concept was designed with the safety of pedestrians and children in mind, and required the construction of a giant road system the like of which had never been seen in Britain.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But Cumbernauld was not anti-car: on the contrary, the huge, wide roads made driving easy, and the town's residential areas were planned with 100% car ownership in mind: garages were everywhere.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">But it is the town centre which is the most remarkable feature of Cumbernauld. Conceived as a giant megastructure which would accommodate all the retail, municipal, and leisure needs of a town of 50,000 people, and topped off by penthouse 'executive' apartments, the multi-layered centre straddled the main dual carriageway below, dominating its surroundings.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">With the completion of the first phase in 1967, the town centre's architect, Geoffrey Copcutt, had given Cumbernauld Britain's first indoor shopping mall.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">But, despite the heroic vision, Cumbernauld was not without its problems. The centre's brutal concrete exterior was grim, and was eventually painted white to brighten it up; its malls and pedestrian walkways became wind tunnels; major retailers stayed away, and financial problems meant that the original Plan was never completely fulfilled.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The penthouses emptied as residents moved to more traditional executive accommodation on the outskirts of the town.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the town struggles against its image of a soulless concrete carbuncle surrounded by roundabouts, a strange tribute to a moment when it was thought that old cities, with their narrow streets, haphazard layout, and confused, illogical centres were a thing of the past.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Despite this, much of Cumbernauld's housing remains a success: its landscaping is considered a triumph, and its population hovers around the 50,000 mark. Visitors still come from around the world to see this grand experiment in modern living. But today Cumbernauld is as much a cautionary tale of the dangers of trying to plan every element of urban life, as it is a successful realisation of a Modernist utopia.</P>
