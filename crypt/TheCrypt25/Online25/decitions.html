<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yesterday was an eventful day and it`s one I won`t forget for some time.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You see, yesterday  I parted with my desktop Amiga 4000.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amiga acquaintance Mark S drove over to see me and around an hour or so later, he 
became the new owner of the little workhorse. With 060 CyberStormIII and Picasso card inside, I know 
Mark will soon put the fine machine to good use.  Happily, it`s no longer destined for the local car 
crusher but will continue to do what all good little A4ks should do,  produce accurate computation - 
Amiga style.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My trouble was, I had too many units at my disposal. Over the years I had become obsessive with 
purchasing these machines and every time I saw a bargain, I could not resist the impulse, so I bought 
it. The thing is, it soon became them, and them became many. In fact, far too many! </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now after a recent illness,<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (which has rendered me useless at lifting even the lightest of things)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, I have 
cleared out a number of good machines but for my personal use, I have retained a couple of A2ks. 
PCs may be mod & cool, but the humble Amiga OS is still a friendly, reliable tool and so long as I have 
one of these around, I know that my Yam composed e-mails will speed happily towards their intended 
destinations without fail - all via Miami. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However, when I`m on the pc, computing life takes on a different perspective. It`s  a complete contrast 
to computing with the Amiga. You see, with a pc, one has to be alert!</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Like many of you, I have to ensure that my fire walls are up and running, Sentinel, Ghost Wash and 
Zone Alarm are assisting me by keeping tabs on things and pop-up controllers are engaged doing their 
job. Yes, the everyday super highway for the pc user is a complete mess. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It`s a separate world from the Amiga and it`s infested with a continuous traffic of spam & spy ware - all 
heading your way. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So thank goodness we have an array of virus checkers and ad killers at our disposal. Without them, 
I`d no doubt spend much more time browsing the internet via the Amiga. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As for the A4k?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, when I saw Mark speed off into the distance, I had the feeling that he was the happier man.
Yes, it`s been an eventful day, and parting with the A4k was with much sorrow.</P>
