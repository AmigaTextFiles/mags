<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>There are quite a number of drawing / art utilities for the classic Amiga,  
including D.T.P.'s.  Here I've found one that bears features of most, in Draw Studio.
The G.U.I. has been deliberately designed in the familiar manner of P. Paint / D. 
Paint to ease use by those unfamiliar with the program,  but additional effects 
abound,  which are most pleasing.</I> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>The complete package is neatly presented;  though not an artist myself, I can 
perceive a powerful package which, in the right hands,  would be an extremely 
versatile tool. In all,  Draw Studio is a veritable concoction of D.T.P.,  C.A.D.,  and 
paint program,  all thrown into one !</I></P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>What we have is a programme which is nicely intuitive, and flexible enough to 
meet a range of applications from the drawing office to instructional presentations, 
and anything in between.  The Warp facility can be used to great effect on fonts, 
giving an "Easy Page-maker" facility for posters or magazines,  and at this stage,  
it's the demo that I'm reporting about, which we couldn't resist a look at !  For 
those curious to try before buying, there is a demo available from 
http://www.haage-partner.de/download/DrawStudio/ which is the one we viewed 
whilst waiting for the full package to arrive.  The full program looks like being 
awesome ! </I> </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the full program finally in hand, I found the package 
    nicely presented, on CD- ROM with CD, Registration Document, Registration 
    Card with the registration number on it<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>important to 
    keep this safe, as Draw Studio will not run without it</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>, 
    and, most importantly, a 96-page manual to enable the user to<FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
    (<I>hopefully</I>) <FONT COLOR=AQUA>create images. In short, very much like 
    Amiga applications in the past, when purchased off the shelf - remember those 
    days? The only difference being, it had no fancy box. Which is good as it 
    saves unnecessary expense, and the box, in our house certainly, either gets 
    committed to the cobwebby recesses of the attic or the dustbin.</font></font></font></font></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Installation was a breeze - a simple drag-and-drop exercise onto the hard-drive.  As 
Draw Studio requires you to enter the registration number, it cannot be used 
directly from CD.  There was no clash with OS3.9 on this system, considering this 
software was written in 1997.  On the CD also were support programs.  MUI, which 
Draw Studio uses as it's GUI<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>the chances are you will already have a more up-to-
date MUI installed, but useful if you have not</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>,  Image Studio, MetaView, Texture 
Studio<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>for those with a FPU - not reviewed here as there is no FPU on this system</I>) 
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>and X-Trace, all shareware, and will need to be registered if you like them and wish 
to use them to their full potential.  Including these in your installation gives the 
facility to import/export creations to and from other software already on your 
system, such as Wordworth, ProPage, etc.  A thoughtful touch was to include 
drawers with demonstration images to show the possibilities of Draw Studio.  </font></font></font></font></P></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very powerful and complex piece of software, and one which may take 
many months of experimentation to master. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Draw Studio can be installed on 68000 CPUs upwards.  The only restriction being a 
minimum of 3Meg free memory after running Workbench and it's associated 
software (backdrops, tool daemons, etc.).  The more memory you are lucky to have, 
the more flexible it is, and the quicker you will be able to run the program.  This is 
the first application I have ever had that makes me want  to upgrade the miggy to 
explore all its possibilities.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Graphics cards are supported, and those with FPUs have greater opportunities for 
creativity available to them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effects, as I've observed earlier, are quite pleasing to use with professional results to 
the modified fonts. Warp is most effective when used for video titling or loader 
pages, giving a possible 3D perspective of fonts.  Wire frame drawing is a familiar 
feature of C.A.D. programs, allowing for a good 3D effect on drawings,  but one 
can't specify a flexible graduation for individual areas of a drawing.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brush facilities don't seem to be supported, which could be 
    of benefit to the program. In preference, the program gives a quantity of 
    shapes which can be moved and resized to one's requirements, hence creating 
    an illustration in sections. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This method is not, however, one that I'm totally familiar with, so a sharp learning 
curve has been required here.  Curved and shadowed text also does what it says 
beautifully,  the nicest touch being re-scalable graphics and fonts wherever you click 
on screen.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ease of use is, to us, a mixture of familiarity and thumbing 
    through the manual at the moment. No doubt, as we get more familiar with Draw 
    Studio, the manual will figure less in the equation. In conclusion, Draw Studio 
    seems to be a fine tool for those with a high degree of "artistic bent", or 
    C.A.D. knowledge, and well worth a look at; not so much if you're a new-comer 
    to computer drawing, which, though unlikely, is not impossible. The first 
    example is a hand-drawn self portrait of myself, for lack of a better subject, 
    showing stages of development. The second is an example of DTP, utilizing 
    a photo image and font warping, with further examples and screen shots as 
    applicable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Data-types supported by the program are as follows :-
IFF-ILBM,  GIF, TIFF, JPEG, BMP, and PCG,  allowing a wide variety of images to be 
imported, and modified,  including titling for convenience.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Saving formats are evidently in DSDG-IFF only, requiring a conversion program to 
change to the above "import" formats<FONT COLOR=SILVER> (<I>Image Studio - supplied</I>)<FONT COLOR=AQUA>  This makes the 
program slightly less agreeable, but Draw Studio is still a superb package in our 
esteem.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Importation Exportation integration is hence a little disjointed,  but only a slight 
drawback to an amazingly flexible program - possibly the shape of things to come !</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Albeit slightly "technical" in it's approach to studio work,  Draw Studio is an 
extremely fine graphics package, and well worth consideration if art, C.A.D. or 
other graphics programs are your forte. We like it - lots !  Presumably better suited 
to higher - end machines with Graphics cards and FPU's,  but with care useable on 
a basic accelerated machine, as Graphics Mem is a bit low otherwise.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Value for money? With the supporting programs included on the 
    C.D., at about a six pounds for each program, I couldn't complain. Now, where's 
    my cheque book?</P>
