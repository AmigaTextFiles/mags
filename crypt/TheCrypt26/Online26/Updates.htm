<blockquote>
<p>Just a quick note about some of the programs that have been updated lately.</p><br>
<center><h2><font color=red> Xolox</font></h2></center><br>
<p>Readers may remember this getting the once over in a previous issue.</p>
<p>Sadly, Xolox in later incarnations became very crash prone and, as such, lost 
  a lot of ground in the P2P stakes.</p>
<p>The new version is 1.32 and goes some way to redressing the balance. The H 
  module bug that plagued this program has been repaired and now works very well 
  indeed. </p>
<p>If you were disappointed before on trying this out, give it another go!</p>

<center><h2><font color=red>WinMX</font></h2></center><br>
<p>Another P2P that has undergone upgrade fever is that stalwart of many, WinMX. 
  It has never managed to surpass the likes of AudioGalaxy, but with that now 
  out of the way, this is one of the new mainstays.</p>
<p>WinMX has always had a following, and this version looks likely to continue 
  the trend. The new version is 3.31 as can be seen below.</p>

<center><h2><font color=red>ZoneAlarm </font></h2></center><br>
<p>ZoneAlarm , the popular firewall software with a free version has also undergone 
  an update. See below for details.</p>
  <center>

<p>This version has a little quirk, however. </p>
<p>After installing the new version and if you have it enabled to start at bootup, 
  you will notice that your machine will go online immediately!</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have broadband………..or a connection that allows you to dialup 
  anytime, be very careful or only start it when you go online!!! </p>
<p>That’s just a very few that I have upgraded recently, and I haven’t mentioned 
  the new DivX5 bundle that’s out, or any of the other programs getting an overhaul. 
  Check out your favourite software download sites. Theres been a lot of activity 
  lately on them.</p>
