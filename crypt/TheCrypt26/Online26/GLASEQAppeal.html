"Ah wiz $hittin' masel", "Ah need some jellies". </P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Earthquake  decimated  the area,  causing  approximately  £30
worth of damage. Untold disruption and distress was caused:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">* Many were woken well before their giro arrived.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Several  priceless collections of mementos from  the  Balearics
and Spanish costas were damaged.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Three  areas of historic and scientifically significant  litter
were disturbed</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*The  cone fell off the head of the statue outside the Modern  Art
Gallery</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Thousands are confused and bewildered,  trying to come to terms
with the fact that something interesting has happened in Glasgow</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">*One resident,  Mary-Alice McGregor, a 17 year old mother-of-three
said  "It was such a shock,  little Chelsea came running  into  my
bedroom  crying.  My youngest two,  Tyler-Morgan and Shauni  slept
through  it.  I was still shaking when I was watching  Trisha  the
next morning."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*Apparently though, looting did carry on as normal. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*The British Red Cross have so far managed to ship 4000 crates  of
buckfast to the area to help the stricken masses.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*Rescue  workers are still searching through the rubble  and  have
found  large  quantities of personal belongings including  benefit
books and jewellery from Elizabeth Duke at Argos.</P>
