pet to keep her company. So off to the pet shop she went. 
Forlornly, she searched.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Nothing seemed to catch her interest, except this one ugly 
frog. As she walked by the barrel he was in, he looked up 
and winked at her! He whispered,<FONT COLOR=LIME> "I'm lonely too, buy me 
and you won't be sorry."</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The  lady figured, what the heck, as she hadn't found 
anything else. So, she bought the frog and went to her car.</P>

you won't be sorry."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> So, she figured what the heck, and

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Miss Bea, the church organist, was in her eighties and
 had never been married. She was much admired for her
 sweetness and kindness to all.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The pastor came to call on her one afternoon early in
 the spring, and she welcomed him into her Victorian
 parlor. She invited him to have a seat while she
 prepared tea.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">As he sat facing her old pump organ, the young
 minister noticed a cut glass bowl sitting on top of
 it, filled with water. In the water floated, of all
 things, a condom. Imagine his shock and surprise.
 Imagine his curiosity! Surely Miss Bea had flipped or
 something...!</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When she returned with the tea and cookies, they began
 to chat. The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity
 about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but
 soon it got the better of him, and he could resist no
 longer.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER> <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Miss Bea," <FONT COLOR=AQUA>he said, <FONT COLOR=SILVER> wonder if you would tell me
 about this?"<FONT COLOR=RED> [pointing to the bowl]</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=RED>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"> "Oh, yes," <FONT COLOR=AQUA>she replied, <FONT COLOR=LIME>"isn't it wonderful? I was
 walking downtown last fall and I found this little
 package on the ground. The directions said to put it
 on the organ, keep it wet, and it would prevent
 disease. And you know ... I haven't had a cold all
