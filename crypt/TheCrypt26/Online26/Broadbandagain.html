<blockquote>
<p>If you have read the interview with SatDrive, you’ll notice that it is mentioned 
  that folk whose exchanges aren’t upgraded to ADSL are coming to the conclusion 
  that they won’t ever be…….</p>
<p>So let’s see how many folk aren’t…………</p>
<p>I checked up on the BT website about the availability of ADSL countrywide. 
  They give a map with their own figures about what percentage are able to get 
  ADSL.</p>
<p>BT is claiming that over 67% of the country can get their service and I was 
  really dismayed to read an interview with one of the regional chiefs (Scottish) 
  in a “quality” Scottish newspaper that people should stop whinging about availability 
  and concentrate on the fact that there is only a 4% take-up in areas that are 
  enabled.</p>
<p>That maybe so , but it isn’t really helpful when BT have claimed that over 
  170 exchanges will never be viable for upgrade and haven’t put a figure on over 
  4000 exchanges. This is with a figure of over 6000 exchanges in total…….in other 
  words over two thirds aren’t enabled!!!!! And if there are already 170 exchanges 
  marked as unviable ……….what does this tell you about the ones they haven’t surveyed? 
  Whinging about availability?????</p>
<p>Here’s their breakdown of figures, I’ve only put the figures down for home 
  and schools………</p>
<p>Scotland</p>
 Home:  39%<br>
Schools : 29%
<p>Wales </p>
Home : 31%<br>
Schools: 19%
<p>Northern Ireland</p>
Home : 47%<br>
Schools: 41%
<p>North West England</p>
Home: 67%<br>
Schools: 66%
<p>North East England</p>
Home: 70%<br>
Schools: 64%
<p>Yorkshire &amp; Humberside</p>
Home: 57%<br>
Schools: 53%
<p>West Midlands</p>
Home : 67%<br>
Schools: 61%
<p>East Midlands</p>
Home: 58%<br>
Schools: 53%
<p>East England</p>
Home: 57%<br>
Schools: 58%
<p>South West England</p>
Home: 47%<br>
Schools: 42%
<p>South East England</p>
Home: 74%<br>
Schools: 73%
<p>London</p>
Home: 100%<br>
Schools: 100%
<p>I , personally, love the figures for London……100% !!!</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, there are quite a few on the ADSL forums complaining that 
  they can’t get ADSL………..and they stay in , would you believe it, London!!!!!!</p>
<p>Britain has just passed the one million mark for broadband users……..a large 
  percentage of these are on cable. BT has tied up with quite a few others to 
  promote broadband………pity we can’t get it then, isn’t it?</p>
<p>For BT chiefs to pat themselves on the back about ADSL rollout deserves some 
  answers. I’d start with “ what grasp of reality do you have” !!!! Answers to 
  the questions…….when are they actually going to upgrade exchanges countrywide?</p>
<p>Why do they find it as expensive to upgrade exchanges and have such a high 
  number of users guaranteed BEFORE they upgrade?</p>
<p>The simple solution to the problem is to remove the network from BT control 
  and instigate a program of upgrades to the network. </p>
<p>BT has failed miserably and (according to OFTEL documents) has systematically 
  dragged its heels every step of the way. </p>
<p>The main problem is what do we replace BT with?</p>
<p>Do we renationalise the network?</p>
<p>In fairness, the only reason that everyone can get a phone line is because 
  it was a nationalised industry. Can you imagine how many people wouldn’t have 
  a telephone if the rollout of exchanges was just commencing nowadays? Sorry 
  folks, there are under 10000 homes in your area, so none of you can get a telephone………</p>
<p>To say that I am disillusioned with BT is a very great understatement. I’d 
  really love to see this Company crash and burn. To treat customers they way 
  they have exposes all the risks that a monopoly entails!!!</p>
<p>The majority of Britain will never get broadband unless there are major changes 
  to the way the network is handled. Another way to get broadband for everyone 
  is to give lots of money to BT to upgrade all exchanges. Reading the previous 
  paragraph above shows what I think of this idea. I’d rather do without than 
  allow BT to expand their monopoly. I want their monopoly removed not extended. 
  I’d love to see a separate holding company for the network with EVERY Telco 
  allowed access to it.</p>
<p>BT has now decided to institute access limits to their dialup customers on 
  their “anytime” account. This means you CAN use your “Anytime” account literally 
  anytime, but better not stay on too long……..their new figure is now down to 
  apprx. 5 hours a day. Considering it takes roughly an hour to download an update 
  through their congested network……..you’d better hope your software doesn’t need 
  updated very often!</p>
<p>BT has also started making rumbling noises about ADSL usage and is threatening 
  to institute download limits. Hullo…………isn’t the point of broadband the fact 
  that you can transfer large amounts of data quickly???? Seems a bit pointless 
  if you can’t actually do what you got broadband for……….</p>
<p>I could point out that Virgin have promised that there will be no limits on 
  their broadband account. </p>
<p>I urge everyone to look for alternatives to BT. Anything which helps to stop 
  BT in its tracks is good for Britain. Even a slight reduction to their income 
  may help change their minds. If you look at BT’s figures for internet access, 
  they aren’t nearly the best deal. People should look around before they decide 
  who to go with.</p>
<p>I’ll restate it, we need to rid the network of BT control!!!!!</p>
<p>IF BT didn’t have the network, I can reasonably predict that they would be 
  a minority business in a very short time. Their whole business is there because 
  they were given the network!!! They have managed to take the British telecomms 
  from being the best in the World to the bottom of the top ten !!!!</p>
<p>Look at their web page about alternatives to ADSL. A couple of trials and no 
  rollout of any of them except for two way satellite access ( yup, for £1000) 
  you can get a slow satellite connection. It would make you sick !!!!!</p>
<p>Government interference is not only needed, but desperately needed. It is their 
  aim to make Britain into Broadband Britain. If they look at Korea as an example, 
  they can get some clues about how to achieve it. It took lots of money invested 
  and lots of different networks competing to achieve it. It can be done, but 
  it needs political will to actually deliver. </p>
<p>I’ve partially exhausted my ire this time…….so I’ll finish with this…….</p>
<p>We need rid of BT control of the telephone network!!!!!!!!</p>
