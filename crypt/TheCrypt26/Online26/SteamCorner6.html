<P ALIGN="LEFT">Since the arrival of public services to railway timetables, the requirement for 
refreshments has been expected by the customer.  In it's infancy,  provision was 
made at stations only,  utilising the changing of trains and waiting arrivals.  This 
took the form of a cold collation originally,  and upon being found to be 
profitable,  extended to hot snacks.  Dispensing machines added to the offerings, 
but the public wanted more.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The fast express services now appearing required a form of catering for the long 
distance traveller,  and in the case of certain services on the L.N.E.R,  the train crew 
also. Specifically designed coaching stock provided a means of moving about the 
length of the train,  and this gave rise to the buffet car being designed.  Not 
content with this alone,  a dining set was also called for,  to be included in 
prestigious "named" expresses.  Each region vied with each other in the opulence of 
their dining services,  as fitting the nature of competition between them,  with the 
more notable services acquiring new names,  i.e. "<I>Master Cutler</I>" etc.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To the extent of prospective further business,  Railway Hotels started to appear for 
the weary traveller.  These were magnificent structures suitable for a five star rating,  
and came in a wide range of architectural styles.  Regretfully,  a lot of these have 
now been turned to other uses or re-developed. The railways had also expanded to 
the seas with their own fleets of steam ships,  making for a total package in 
transportation.  As the railways grew,  there came a need for overnight travel;  this 
brought about sleeping car facilities on long distance hauls.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This was an exciting time for both railwayman and the general public;  style, 
panache, comfort and speed were the subjects of the day,  and train-spotters 
abounded in proliferation wherever and whenever they could.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The variety of locomotive stock was colossal,  and through workings meant that 
generally there was always something of interest to the observer.  Brightly coloured 
locos mixing with black ones gave an interest which the modern railway had all but 
totally lost until recent years, but the interest for the "<I>spotter</I>" has faded 
significantly, perhaps permanently.  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The first rate dining services have gone from main line workings,  but have been a 
saviour for preservation societies,  eager to maintain a way of life that has passed 
into history,  along with so many aspects of Britain's railway system.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Aunt Florrie took me to Guide Bridge Station as I was going to visit my Dad.  He 
was repairing telephone lines in London during the Blitz. On arriving at London 
Road Station, Manchester, I went to what engines were on the platforms, as only 
the carriages were at my departure platform, when, to my amazement, Sir Nigel 
Gresley pushing a corridor coach backed on to my train.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You didn't see many corridor coaches at that time. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Have a good run</I>"<FONT COLOR=SILVER>, I called to 
the driver and fireman.  One replied <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<I>We have a ten minute stop at Crewe</I>"<FONT COLOR=SILVER>, so on I 
jumped and got a corner seat at the window and we were off.  At that moment, a 
young lady appeared and opened the carriage sliding door, and I saw she had a 
small Yorkie Terrier in her arms, but she had no luggage.  I offered to hold her 
dog while she took off her coat and got settled, then we talked about this and 
that for a few minutes.  She said her dog was thirsty, and she took it to the toilet 
to get it a drink from the tap, but back she came straight away and asked if I 
would help her. </font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><FONT COLOR=LIME>Tap were too hard to turn</font></I><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>"so off I went to help.  Well we had no sooner got 
into the toilet, when she shut the door, saying, "<I><FONT COLOR=LIME>Seven and sixpence Dearie</font></I><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>".  
I told her she didn't have to give me anything for helping her. "<B><FONT COLOR=LIME>NO! NO!</font></B><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>" she 
exclaimed,  "<I><FONT COLOR=LIME>7/6d and I will show you a good time !</font></I><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>". "<B><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>NAY! NAY! lady</font></B><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>" I said,

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There have been all manner of practices brought about in the past enabling 
efficient running of the railways.  Some of these have been somewhat questionable, 
and some have caused panic to bystanders.   A classic example of this would be the 
"<I>slip coach</I>";  namely a coach or two fitted with a device to disconnect it from the 
main train at speed,  allowing it to coast freely onto a branch line.  The secondary 
guard would control the detachment of the vehicle,  and bring the coach(<B>es</B>) to a 
halt using the brake fitted.  Though this type of service wasn't uncommon to 
railwaymen,  frequent panic reports of "<I>break-aways</I>" made them less than popular 
with station masters,  courtesy of the general public.  This practice has now ceased, 
due to few branch lines being left, and also being frowned upon by the safety 
inspectorate.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Goods were no exception to Murphy's Law, either.  The conveyance of livestock 
produced problems of it's own, featuring spirited race horses trying to beat the 
train they were to be transported by, furious bulls disassembling cattle trucks to the 
alarm of all, and crates of chicks finding a new freedom within the parcels offices.
In fact,  goods came in all shapes and sizes, and fees charged for transportation 
provided clerks with frequent head-aches, never mind the previous mentioned 
problems !  Of course,  these antics were usually far from the eyes of the general 
public,  but amusing, never the less.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most of these incidents stemmed from branch lines and country halts,  which no 
doubt had more than their fair share of anecdotes.  One example was of a station 
awaiting a V.I.P. inspection,  with a goods train to clear the station before the 
arrival of the V.I.P.'s train.  At the time,  the fashion was that milk was conveyed in 
churns on the platform of the guards' van for ease of handling, and such was the 
case this day.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Staff had spent hours painting, polishing, cleaning etc. and the station was 
immaculate,  with staff in their best uniforms and flower-beds weeded.  The crew of 
the passing freight were behind schedule,  and determined to make up the lost 
time as they got a right-away.  The exhaust bellowed, the couplings snatched, and 
the milk churn emptied it's contents along the entire length of the platform as the 
freight cleared the station in haste, leaving staff dripping milk.  All in a day's work, 
so they say!</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=RED><H1><CENTER><U>Hump Shunting</U> </CENTER></H1>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not quite what you'd think to be a source of amusement, but even goods yards 
had their moments - the "<I>Hump Shunting Yards</I>" were so arranged that wagons 
were driven up the hump, uncoupled, and left to roll under their own inertia into 
the road (<B>siding</B>) allocated to that vehicle.  In their infancy, the shunter applied the 
brake manually,  usually with the uncoupling hook known as a shunter's pole.</P>  

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This was a less than shunter-friendly method, which resulted in the hook ensnaring 
itself in the brake mechanism of an occasion, leading to an unscheduled ride for the 
unfortunate shunter.  No brake, sixteen tons at average finding it's own speed, and 
a very noisy shunter trying to release both himself and his hook, before the 
inevitable rapid halt against other wagons.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A most evidently welcome improvement was the development of the rail-brake, 
where a secondary rail on pivots and hydraulically driven acted against the inside of 
the wheels as a form of disc-brake.  These devices were operated from the yard 
office, leaving the shunter free to simply uncouple wagons in relative safety.
This new device had an unexpected benefit for the yards they were fitted in, it 
enabled a faster sorting of wagons, which was no bad thing, with Toton Yard 
(<B>Nottingham</B>) handling massive amounts of goods per hour.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the residents near Toton, the eventual demise of steam and goods could not be 
missed on New Year's Day, as the tradition of the yard was to "<I>Pipe In The New 
Year</I>".  This was accomplished by possibly as many as 200 locos sounding their 
whistles in uniformity.  The yard now stands empty and overgrown, the herald of 
the coming year sounds no more.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dirty and inefficient though the steam locomotive was, there's no doubt that with 
it's demise, a certain quality of life also disappeared.  The olfactory effects of these 
machines and their work have left an indelible mark on people who otherwise had 
very little to do with the railways,  indeed a way of life for some without them ever 
realizing it.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Well, that's all for now.  I hope that Steam Corner is informative and amusing for 
you all - and if any of you have never seen a steam train,</I>  <B>do so.</B> </P>
