 <P ALIGN="LEFT">At Chelmsford, Essex in 1566, the first notable witch trial in
England occurred.
The charges against three defendants, Elizabeth Francis,
Agnes Waterhouse and her daughter Joan
were typical of most English trials as the highly imaginative
stories of young children were accepted as evidence.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Agnes Waterhouse was hanged on July 29, 1566
(<I>possibly the first woman hanged for witchcraft in England</I>).
 Elizabeth Frances was imprisoned for a year,
and then in 1579, she was charged with witchcraft again
and hanged and Joan Waterhouse was found not guilty.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Another notable trial in Chelmsford occurred in 1589,
which involved one man and nine women four were hanged
and three were found not guilty.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Three of the witches were executed within two hours of sentencing:
Joan Coney, Joan Upney and Joan Prentice.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">A mass trial at Chelmsford took place in 1645,
 in which thirty-two women were accused and
 nineteen were hanged.</P>

covenant with the devil, she could not accurately
recite the Lord's Prayer and that she stuck pins in a waxen image.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> A mob took her to a pond to "swim" her
(<I> if she floated, she was a witch, if no, she was innocent</I>)
and she "swam like a cork".</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">As a result of being thrown in the pond, she took ill and died.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Fourteen-year old Anne Gunther fell ill and had fits and
was in a constant hysterical state.</P>

all of whom allegedly tormented the girl.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The women were arraigned at court in 1605
and they were found not guilty.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">An incident in the Civil War in England in 1643
documents a very unusual execution of a witch by shooting.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Some men of the Cromwellian army saw a woman
walking on the water (<I>probably using stilts</I>).</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Seizing the woman, the soldiers decided that
she was a witch and they "resolved themselves to make a shot at her".</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">At this point, legend takes over and it is said
that the woman, while laughing at the soldiers,
caught their bullets in her hands and chewed them.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Finally, one soldier slashed her forehead and
"discharged a pistol underneath her ear,
at which she straight sunk down and died."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> In England, the last official execution of a witch occurred in 1682,
and the last conviction for witchcraft took place in 1712.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">However, in 1751 at Tring,) Hertfordshire,
an old couple were lynched by a mob
who accused them of being witches.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Ruth Osborne and her husband were both very old and poor.
They were always blamed for any trouble in the village,
such as the death of cows or causing fits.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">On April 22, 1750 a mob went after the couple,
 stripped them naked, bound them and dragged
 them two miles to a stream.
They were thrown into the stream where both
were beaten and prodded with sticks and they died.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">A hero in the mob by the name of Colley
was found guilty and hanged in chains on
August 24, 1751.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLUE> <CENTER><B>ST. OSYTH WITCHES (ENGLAND)</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> In 1582, several individuals were accused
of witchcraft, in which the testimony of children
 ranging in age from six to nine was eagerly received.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Two women were hanged, Elizabeth Bennet,
for killing a man and his wife and
Ursula Kempe was indicted for three deaths
and consequently hanged.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"> In July, 1680, a little child of John Godfrey died,
and the old cry of witchcraft was raised again.
An inquest was held, with twelve solid men of
Hampton for jurors, and a verdict rendered:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> "We find grounds of suspicion that the said child
 was murdered by witchcraft."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Godfrey's wife and daughter, Sarah ,
deposed that Rachel Fuller came in with
her face daubed with molasses, and sat down
by Goody Godfrey, who had a sick child in
her lap, and took his hand; when the mother, in fear,
drew the hand away and wrapped it in her apron.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Then Rachel Fuller "turned her about and
smote the back of her hands together
sundry times and spat in the fire.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">" Then she strewed herbs on the hearth and sat down
again and said: "Woman, the child will be well;"
and then went out, beat herself thrice with
her arms, as men do in winter, to heat their hands,
picked something off the ground, and went home.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The next day, the children told their mother that
 Goody Fuller had said if they did lay sweet bays
under the threshold, it would keep a witch
from coming in. So they laid bays under
the threshold of the back door all the way,
and half way of the breadth of the fore door;
and soon after, Rachel Fuller came
to the fore door, though she had always formerly
come in at the back door, which is
next her house; and she crowded in
on that side where the bays lay not,
 and rubbed her back against the post so
that she rubbed off her hat, and sat down and made
 ugly faces and nestled about and would
have looked on the child, but not being
allowed to do so, went out as she had come in,
after having looked under the door where
the bays lay; and she had not been in the house since.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> John Godrey, Nathaniel Smith and Hezron Leavitt
made depositions, equally damaging.
Elizabeth Denham (<I>wife of Alexander</I>),
deposed that Rachel Fuller told her "Witches did so
go abroad at night, they did lay their husbands
and children asleep;" and she said there were
eight women and two men in the town, who were witches and wizards.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The men's names were not given, but the
women Goody Fuller reckoned as witches were:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Eunice Cole, Benjamin Evans' wife and two (?) daughters,
Grace (<I>Swaine</I>) Boulter, Mary (<I>Boulter</I>)
Prescott, Isabella (<I>Austin</I>) Towle,
"and one that is now dead. " Goody Towle,
was, in fact, arraigned about the same time
, on a different charge, and both she and Rachel Fuller
were committed to prison till the sitting
of the Hampton Court, September 7.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Then, "The Court having heard the
case of Rachel Fuller and Isabel Towle
 being apprehended and committed upon
superstition of witchcraft doe ordr yt
they still continue in prison till bond
be given for their good behaviour of
£100 a piece during the Courts pleasure."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> John Fuller became bondsman for his wife;
and Isaac Marston and John Redman,
for Goody Towle. They were discharged at the Dover Court
the next year.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Amy Denny & Rose Cullender of Lowestoft were tried
and executed as witches at Bury St Edmunds-March 1662</P>
