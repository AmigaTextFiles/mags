<P ALIGN="LEFT">When  preparing  and  doing  spells  be  sure  to  visualize  your
intentions.  The more positive energy you put in the  quicker  the
manifestation  time and also the results depend  upon  the  energy
you put in in to them.  Now this does not mean you should focus on
your  goals  until  they manifest but only  as  long  as  you  are
working  your  magic  spell.  When you are finished  burning  your
herbs  and candles,  release all the energy into the universe  and
ask  for  the  universe to provide your answers or goals.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It  is
always good to remember that you are the creator of your life  and
are  responsible for the outcome of your creations (KARMA). What
goes  around  comes around.  With that in mind  I  will  continue.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">First  gather the herbs that have elements that will  attract  the
desired  results for whatever you are creating at the time.   Some
people  like to grow their own and others are welcome to shop  on-
line  at EnchantedWizard.com.</P>


  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Next I suggest a large stone  or
metal  bowl for a safe place to burn the charcoal.  It is best  to
use  a mortar and pestal to mix your herbs in.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Focus on what  you
are  creating  while  mixing  the   herbs.   Preparation  is  very
important for it is the foundation of the spell.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I like to  write
out  my  wishes  or whatever I am asking for as though  they  have
already  happened,  I visualize this also as I  am  writing.   You
don't  have  to  use  a  special kind of paper  but  if  you  have
parchment  paper  it  is okay to use it.  When  you  are  finished
writing,  gather together the candles you wish to burn and be sure
to  use  the  proper  color  for whatever  spell  you  are  doing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Example:   I like to use white candles on the four corners  of  my
alter,  then I use the colored candles that represent the energy I
am  putting  into the spell.  You can use one or  more  colors  of
candles.  I put these candles in the center of the alter.  I use a
pestal  handed down from my Grandmother as a charcoal  burner/  It
is  made of lava rock,  and does get hot but the legs keep it  off
the  alter.  You can also put sand in a small metal bowl  or  rock
bowl for burning your charcoal or use a piece of ceramic tile.   I
also  set  this  in the middle of the alter and  set  the  candles
around  it.   Now you are ready to light your candles. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I  use  a
separate  candle  to light the others.  Lighting  the  white  ones
first I ask the white light to surround me and protect me as I  do
my spell.  Then I light the colored candles being thankful for the
manifestation  of  whatever I am  asking  for  as  though  it  has
already happened.  Next I use a pair of needle nose pliers to hold
the  charcoal  over  the  fire of the candle  to  light  it</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">  The
charcoal will spark and become very hot.  Put the charcoal on  the
bowl  or  tile you have provided for it.  Now mix your  herbs  one
more  time putting your energy into them and sprinkle  it  on  the
charcoal  as  you see the smoke rise see your desires manifesting.
Repeat  the sprinkling of the herbs until half of the  mixture  is
gone.  You can repeat your own mantra or prayer at this time also.
You  can  now  reread the paper you have written out your  desires
on.   Do this out loud.  You are putting energy into it this  way.
Now  burn  your  paper and ask the universe to  provide  you  with
manifestation  of your desired results.  PLACE THE  LEFTOVER  HERB
MIXTURE IN YOUR MOJO BAG AND CARRY IT WITH YOU.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
