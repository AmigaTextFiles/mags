 <CENTER>He answers that he is looking for a box of tampons for his wife. She directs him down the correct aisle.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER>A few minutes later, he deposits a huge bag of cotton balls and a ball of string on the counter. She says, confused, "Sir, I thought you were looking for some tampons for your wife?"</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>He answers, "You see, it's like this, yesterday, I sent my wife to the store to get me a carton of cigarettes and she came home with a tin of tobacco and some rolling papers.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Because it is <I>Soooooo</I> much cheaper. So, I figure that if I have to roll my own, <B>SO DOES SHE!</B></CENTER>
