Once you try Broadband you will NEVER go back to dial-up AND <br>
You will KNOW that £30 a month is WELL worth it (I'm open to reductions in cost though).<br>
No more hogging the phone line ....<br>
El Rapido access ...<br>
Connect & forget ...<br>
No "Drop out" connections (two hour limits) ..<br>
It does go on ... I'm sure other peeps will mention the advantages of BB<br><br>

I have the agree with The_Editor.<br>
  We have Telwest broadband at work and it flies. I do all my downloading there 
  cos BT are such pain in the a$$, tight-fisted gits (sorry, I don't like them) 
  and I can't get ADSL in my area at home. Oh, but BT can spend £10m on advertising 
  broadband which just makes me even more....angry (you know what I mean)<br>

Yup. We've got Blueyonder here (Telewest) and it's superb. I mean, who in their right mind would give it up? <br>
Dial up 4.5 KB/s<br>
B/Band 65 KB/s<br><br>

I'm sticking to dialup for the moment. It's real slow, but it happens to be cheap. There are cheap broadband options in the UK, but most of them are of very restricted bandwidth (128-256k) or have traffic caps, such as 10Gb a month. No way is that worth the price. The Germans, for instance, can get unresricted 2Mb DSL for the same price as I could get 512k cable or capped 1Mb DSL. Why should I put up with that?<br>

Until things change, I'm going to clog up BT's phone lines leeching all day like a nutter until they put a hour restriction on Surftime - which they will, by 1st November this year. If they don't like it, they can get off their arses and add DSL to my country (BT label everything north of Yorkshire as a "rural" area) or cable companies can give better prices. I mean, there are only 3 million people living within 20km of Glasgow - more than the population of Leeds - so why should BT bother...? Grrr!<br><br>

I've got a Blueyonder 1Mbps cable connection and I'd rather go without food than give it up. <br>

If I had to go back to 56K modem I'd give up the Internet. Well I would have to coz I would have starved to death.<br><br>

Here in the UK the chances of having broadband are like the chances of finding that needle lost in a hay stack so long ago.  

If you live in a big city here you tend to have more of a chance, but I don't. And I don't fancy moving to the city just for that purpose.<br>

 That would be stupid!  <br>

I'm massively pi$$ed off about that. Used to have BB access in UNI but finished my course now.<br><br>

  I read final report on the failed "Broadband through Electric Wire" trial project 
  in UK from NORTEL. The street lamp etc will turn into transmitter and the ISP 
  can't maintain privacy for the customer. However in German and Austria, PLC 
  projects are succesful with more than 10 million subscriber. Another failed 
  broadband is Horizontal Blanking from Metabox (creator of AmiJoe). The new Proxim 
  Wi-Fi wireless device can reach up to 10 Miles at speed of 10 Mbps. NYC Wireless 
  (NY, USA) plan to use this device. Perhaps there will be similar effort in London 
  / other cities in UK. Unfortunately the ISP / backbone companies are against 
  Free Wi-Fi wireless internet access, because the public can use their bandwidth 
  illegally.<br>
