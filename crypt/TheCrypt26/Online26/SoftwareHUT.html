the list of products and have included some special bundles. To see the

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">We have updated our used site with many more new products and 
prices. With Amiga hardware and some software becoming more and more hard 
to find this section has been invaluable for our customers who can not 
locate certain items. Also, look for a special price on the 3000+ 
collectors machine which we have in inventory. The owner who is selling it 
through us has allowed us a special lower price. The unit, serial # 27, is 
in pristine shape and runs perfectly. As a special bonus for our newsletter 
readers we are still including 2 Original Commodore tie Pins in their 
signed cases which were worn by Dave Haynie and George Robinson at the 
Amiga 500 Introduction in New York many years ago. To see this and the 
whole list of other fine used products please visit:</P>
