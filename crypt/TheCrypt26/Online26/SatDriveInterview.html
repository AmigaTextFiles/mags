<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Surfing away and feeling ever more despondent by the way 
that Broadband rollout is progressing, I came across a Satellite system provider 
in the shape of SatDrive. Their web page is well laid 
out and has loads of information about their particular system. The price of 
£14.99 per month intrigued me as well, so I ended up contacting the company .</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Their Managing Director,</I> <B>Eoin Lambkin</B>, <I>agreed to answer some questions for 
the magazine.</I></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=Black>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1.</B> <I>Is Satdrive a new Company?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes and no. Yes, it is a new Company, having started our service in September.
The truth is that the Company has been up and running since last year, however.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2.</B> <I>How long have they been in the Satellite business?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Company was started to promote this particular product, so I suppose you could 
say that it is for the same amount of time. I have worked in the satellite industry for a number 
of years beforehand, and this is why I started the company. I used to work for TELES (<B>which is a German company
specialising in Telecommunication technology</B>). </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Their product , I felt, was a winner and we licensed  it for ourselves.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3.</B> <I>BT is claiming that interest in Broadband is rising dramatically, have satellite businesses such as yours experienced the same?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Very much so. BT's current advertising is free advertising for ourselves. I believe
the general public are starting to realise that the chances of them getting
ADSL in a non activated ADSL exchange from the major Telco's are now getting slimmer by the day, and 
our product is there to bridge the gap. This has resulted in a booming line 
of enquiries.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.</B> <I>I notice on your site</I> ( <A HREF="http://www.satdrive.com">http://www.satdrive.com</A> ) <I>that Peer to Peer is never mentioned, does this mean that it can't be used?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Not at all! Peer to peer networking works well using <B>Satdrive</B>. We just don't advertise the fact. 
Not only because this isn't the market we are aiming for, but the legality 
of these programs are a grey area at present.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5.</B> <I>Why don't you wish users of your system to make use of P2P</I> </P>



<FONT COLOR=TEAL>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I never said that we don't want users to use P2P, just that 
    we don't advertise that it does work. In fact, most P2P's work under it, I 
    think it is the latest version of Morpheus that has problems with it.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>6.</B> <I>Satellite is a contended service, how heavily contended is it?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm afraid that contention isn't the issue with satellite. It is entirely different
from conventional landline systems. With satellite, the difference is that all the data goes 
to the satellite as fast as we can get it there.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The bottleneck is how fast can you take it away. An analogy, water 
    and a funnel, The funnel holds a lot of water, but the bottom of the funnel 
    where it comes out is the limiting factor. When our satellite transponder 
    reaches optimum capacity we then activate a second transponder and so on to 
    provide ever increasing capacity for the customer base.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>7.</B> <I>I know that games playing on satellite systems is pretty  useless, due to the
high latency, I have also heard that web browsing in general isn't much faster</I>........<I>is 
this true?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">On two way satellite systems this is true as the time it takes to connect up and 
down both ways to the satellite makes browsing no better than using a 56K modem. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With our one way service browsing can be greatly improved, once your dial up 
request to the website has been made the return path for browsing benefits from 
the fast satellite download connection. So content rich sites 
appear much faster than they would through an ordinary modem service.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>8. </B><I>You have a list of programs that work via satellite, is there a list of programs
that don't?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">We have a <B>FAQ</B> on our site and this is being constantly updated. Users of our system
comment on various aspects and these are included. This includes programs and anything else that 
our users have found noticeable.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>9.</B> <I>BT has recently</I> ( with some judicious prodding from OFTEL) <I>announced that their 
minimum contract for ADSL will now be 90 days as opposed to one year, are  Satdrive going to follow suit?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">We don't see the need. Our contract is for 12 months, but anyone is free to give
a months notice after 
six months. As our user base expands, this may alter
slightly, but really, we are in for the long haul and it would be suicide if we provided a service 
that folk disliked and wanted to leave.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>10.</B> <I>Does Satdrive do a trial period, in other words, people willing to pay
for installation, but unwilling to commit to a years contract without concrete
knowledge of how well it will do in their area?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">No, we don't. We do, however, have two showrooms where people can come in and view 
and try out the system to see how it handles etc. We enjoy showing our system 
and believe that it is a good one.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>11.</B> <I>In my area, I had no problem getting Sky ( not the digital system) with a 60cm dish, does this mean that the same size dish would be suitable for Satdrive</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">The same size dish would be ideal, we recommend and supply a 60cm dish.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>12.</B> <I>In fact, could an old Sky dish be used for Satdrive?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">No,  it isn't analogue. A new Sky dish would do, though.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>13.</B> <I>Sticking with the Sky example, I used to lose the signal occasionally in winter
  when it snowed. Would the same happen with Satdrive</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Weather can cause a fade in the signal, but it would have to 
    be really severe to lose the signal completely. This system has been used 
    in Germany for a couple of years and has had no major problems with this ......and 
    their winters are worse than ours. Besides, this system is different from 
    a television signal. If a packet gets missed, it is retransmitted, you can't 
    really do the same with a television picture.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>14.</B> <I>£14.99 for one month at up to 4mb/s download speed seems a bit of a miracle
when you compare it to other offerings</I> ( such as Netsystems), <I>is
this price subsidised by the Government </I>( since I see a Government link on
your website) ?</P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">There are no subsidies of any kind involved with this package. Our business
plan is such that we will manage 
well with our current prices. Again, I must stress, we are in this for the 
 long haul. We haven't priced this ( <I>as some Telco's are reputed to have done</I>) as a loss leader to get punters in. This wouldn't be how we envision the 
business going forward. We intend to move towards a content portal 
service, where the likes of independent content polishers can offer SatDrive 
users the ability to have their content multicast  on a pay per view or store 
basis. For instance a conference would take place in City Tokyo and we could distribute 
the video presentations to people who either couldn't afford or manage to get 
there or just wanted to see and hear what was been presented. Other 
content will be for instance E-Learning courses, music and archive material.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>15.</B> <I>With the gearstick for priority downloads, will users who use the basic
  package still manage to download at fast speeds?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">To be blunt...... yes! It is our intention to provide a good service to all our customers. We have taken 
up an entire transponder and if, in the future, bandwidth has been used up, we have 
ensured that more transponders are available. We specifically went 
to EutelSat because of this. There are more spare transponders available 
and another satellite has been launched last year to provide for large increases 
situated on the same space location . </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The gearstick is for users who really need a large file 
delivered quickly. Another point to note is that you would only pay extra for 
this file, not move to another tariff. Bandwidth management is at the heart 
of our system. With a satellite system, we can do this, whereas the likes of 
ADSL can't. We can prioritise all downloads in this way.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>16.</B> <I>Is Satdrive primarily a service for businesses?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Not  businesses as such, although we welcome businesses as well. Our target market 
is for home office types, serious surfers where large downloads and speed of 
information is important. The fact that email is available
regardless of whether you are using the telephone and files can be sent to you. A request for a file 
results in the file being on your hardrive when you get home, if you have 
left the computer on. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our product is only for a single computer at present, but 
we are working to launch a LAN version as well. This should happen in 
the near future.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>17.</B> <I>And </I><B>:)</B> ......... <I>what sort of speeds would people expect to get ?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">We had a party in looking at our system yesterday and we invited 
    them to actually download things instead of just asking questions. They downloaded 
    a 130mb update file in approx.. 15 minutes. The speed varied, naturally, between 
    around 70 - 300 kb/s. </P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">This was at 4p.m. in the afternoon, I should add, so it wasn't 
    a quiet period. It all depends on whether you are downloading from a fast 
    server. We deliver the files as fast as we can, dependent on how fast we can 
    get them from the server.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>18.</B> <I>ISP's tend to throw you offline if you aren't using their connection, and
pinging the server periodically is generally frowned upon, how do users avoid
getting thrown offline with monotonous regularity?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">You won't get flung offline, I wouldn't think. Your ISP will see you dial in
but that's as far as they go. Since you aren't downloading or causing any heavy traffic, they will probably 
be quite pleased with you.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>19.</B> <I>On the website it states that you won't support any equipment that you don't
supply. Since Satdrive uses </I><B>EutelSat</B> <I>I presume anything that EutelSat supports
  would be sufficient to use Satdrive as well?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Please remember, our prices are based on a total package. It may seem a lot cheaper if , say you were getting 
 your equipment from another supplier.However, we only promise that our equipment will work. We make our own cards, so we know exactly how they perform, all others are up to yourselves.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We don't stop anyone from using them, though, and we do publish details on our website on how to configure them to use our system.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>20.</B> <I>It is also stated that the fee includes standard installation of the dish
except where the installation is outwith 35 miles from the installers.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Where are your installers based........I'd hate to order the system , then find
that the installers are based in London.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">No worries there either. We outsource the installations to a firm which controls all our installations 
, which in turn vets local installers. Our aim is to have a system installed 
within 7 days of ordering, so as soon as the dish and card have been 
received, you will probably get a call from our approved  installer to find an acceptable 
time and date to have it fitted.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>21.</B> <I>Do you have users from all of Britain, or is your customer base from certain regions?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">We have users, (<B>currently around the 4000 mark split between Germany and the UK</B>), from all areas of Britain and Ireland. These 
range from the likes of Truro, so you can see our system reaches all of Britain</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>22.</B> <I>BT is going to cap users on dialup from November and there are rumours
that their ADSL users will be capped as well, have Satdrive any plans to curtail
downloads or time used?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">NO! We don't believe that this is a valid way forward. Our plan is to provide a service, not curtail 
users who pay for the service. As I stated before, if bandwidth becomes 
an issue, we have made provisions for plenty more capacity.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>23.</B> H<I>ow do you see the Broadband market advancing in Britain in the near future?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">I believe there is a vast as yet untapped market for broadband. It is our intention to enter this market fully. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I believe our service has noticeable benefits to ADSL and the likes. 
For instance, we can multicast dedicated content to closed user groups.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>24.</B> <I>Since you are in the Satellite business, I presume that you do not believe
that the alternatives such as wireless based LAN's, ADSL and its variants
will ever cover the whole of Britain.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">True, I don't see the whole country ever getting all these. My personal belief is that ADSL is old technology 
and won't actually be up to the standard required for Broadband Britain. We should be looking for new technology. Wireless may be a good prospect, but not in its present form. The technology coming out in a couple of years time will  be far superior.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>25.</B> <I>How would you best describe the appeal of satellite to anyone using dialup ?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Simply for the speed increase, essential. For the ease of use, the fact that you can request files and 
have them downloaded while you are off doing something else. I could go on and 
on.........</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>26.</B> <I>Do you foresee the cost of installation for satellite dropping or rising?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">The cost of installation is down to the installers, I'm afraid.  I expect to come down in price in say, six months. The USB card probably as well.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>27.</B> <I>Is planning consent required for a Satdrive installation ?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">That would depend on your personal circumstances. In most cases, I doubt it.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>28. </B><I>I see that streaming radio and television stations from the satellite are
  on their way on your system, any timescale for these?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">We are in discussions with various broadcasting companies wishing 
    to stream their MP4 content to new customer bases. It is a chicken and egg 
    situation, we need a good sized customer base to make it economic for these 
    companies to stream content over our satellite. The proposal is to run some 
    pilot schemes in the near future based on news type content. We are not interested 
    in delivering entertainment based content as this market is well catered for.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>29.</B> <I>Any details on the television stations or the radio stations expected to be
  on the system?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">It is the same situation as for TV. We are looking to segment dedicated bandwidth 
on a second transponder which will provide the radio and MP4 channels thus not 
eating into the bandwidth used for the normal download services. We will keep 
everyone posted as to our progress on the website.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>30.</B> <I>What exactly is a multi transponder?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">A transponder is a physical segment of a satellite and there 
    can be as many as 20 plus transponders on any one satellite. SatDrive can 
    be delivered over multiple transponders hence our ability to ever increase 
    our bandwidth to our growing number of customers. </P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>31.</B> <I>Can people use their own equipment to access Satdrive?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes. People are free to use their own equipment. We won't support their equipment ,
 as I said before. We only support our own hardware.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>32. </B><I>Is support free, or is it a premium rate number?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Support is free, you pay the normal rate for the phone call. We aim to provide a quality service and 
we want people to telephone for help if they do, by some quirk, have problems. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We want happy customers.</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>33.</B> <I>Would the average user manage to install the software 
    provided? In other words, how proficient are you required to be to install 
    the Satdrive software?</I></P>

<FONT COLOR=TEAL><P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, nothing is idiot proof. But its as near as we can make it. The whole
install process should take around five minutes once the dish has been installed and is locked onto the correct 
satellite. It tells you what it is doing every step of the way and driver installation is automatic.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I spent a short time talking to Eoin and I must say, found him very reasonable
to talk to. The fact that he is passionate in his belief of his product, I expected. I would also add that the fact he didn't shy away from any questions reassuring.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">This product does look intriguing and may well be the only way 
    that some of us actually get a fast download rate. At the price of £14.99 
    per month it won't break the bank either. The only major consideration is 
    whether you can get a dish to face 8 degrees West and , of course the cost 
    of the installation total, which runs at around the £400 mark.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Why not give Satdrive a call (<B>01256 773339</B>) if you're interested, 
    or check out their website. And do please mention that you read about their 
    service in this Magazine!! </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Every little helps </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
