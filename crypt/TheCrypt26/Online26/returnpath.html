 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Return Path helps keep you in touch with family, friends, business associates and online subscriptions after an e-mail address change. So how does the system work? Simply.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our registration process is fast, free and as easy as entering your old and current e-mail addresses. We then send an e-mail to you so you can select your account options and get re-connected.</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">When a contact discovers that your old e-mail address is no longer current, Return Path's service helps locate you. The requester enters your old e-mail address and asks for your current one.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">What happens next is up to you. Return Path will either automatically provide your e-mail address, or we will submit the requester's information to you for approval via e-mail. You determine your preferred course of action during the registration process.</P>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>How does Return Path work?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you change your physical address, you register the change with the post office. When you change your e-mail address, you should register with Return Path. The Return Path service does not forward mail; it requires your permission before providing your current e-mail address to friends, family, business associates or online subscriptions in search of your current e-mail address. </P>


<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><B>Does Return Path forward all e-mail sent to my old address?</B></B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">No. Return Path is not a forwarding service. Instead, Return Path offers an e-mail address change directory system, allowing people to locate you after an e-mail change of address. Once you register your e-mail address change with Return Path, contacts will be able to find you through the Return Path Network.
</P>


<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Why should I sign up for this service?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">Registering with Return Path is a good way to keep in touch with friends and online subscriptions that you may forget to notify of an e-mail address change. When your e-mail address change is entered into the Return Path system, you immediately become "findable" - but only to people whom you want to have your e-mail address. In addition, Return Path offers other services that can help you manage an e-mail change of address. Once registered, you are able to utilize our notification system and get guidance on topics surrounding your e-mail change of address process. And, it's FREE and easy to use.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What if I don't want someone to have my current e-mail address?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">Your current e-mail address is only given upon your approval. Upon registering with Return Path, you are offered two different ways of approving who will receive your current e-mail address. You can choose our automatic option, which lets requesters with your old e-mail have your current one; or you can choose to be notified every time someone makes a request.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Does my information stay private?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes. We only provide your e-mail address to people you approve. Your privacy and security is a high priority. </P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>If the service is free, how does Return Path make money?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">While the Return Path service is free for you, your family and friends, it is not free for online subscription services. Return Path is paid by online subscriptions that are reconnected with you as a result of our service.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Will I get unsolicited e-mail if I sign up with Return Path?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">No. The only e-mail you will receive as a result of our service will be from contacts reconnecting with you and occasional Return Path messages. While some of these may be online subscriptions, they will only be subscriptions that you once chose to join and that are affiliated with Return Path. The network does not include any companies that do not meet our privacy standards.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>How does Return Path know that the e-mail address change was really made by me?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">When a registration is made with Return Path, the e-mail address change must be verified before it goes into effect. Return Path is founded on strict privacy principles that aim to protect you from any inaccuracies. </P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>If I give Return Path the e-mail addresses of friends while using the Notify Friends section, will that information be handled securely? Will they receive any e-mail from Return Path or other marketers as a result?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">When you use our e-mail notification system to update your address with friends, the information you provide is only utilized for your e-mail purposes. Those addresses will not be used by Return Path in any other fashion and will not be sold.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What if I have more than one change of address to register?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Return Path system allows you to direct multiple old addresses to one current address. To do so, register one address with Return Path and then visit your Address Manager on the Return Path web site to add others.</p>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Can Return Path help me find other people's e-mail addresses?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes. Return Path offers an "E-mail Finder" service that allows you to search for the current e-mail addresses of lost contacts. This is a free service.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What if a subscription I have is not part of the Return Path Network? Can they still find me?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">If a subscription service is not currently a member of our network, they will not have immediate access to your current address. However, the list of subscription services partnering with Return Path grows daily. If a company joins after your address posting, we will provide them with your current address with your permission.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Why do I have to save the e-mail Return Path sends me upon activation?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">The Return Path system allows you - and nobody else -- access to your account profile. Instead of being controlled using passwords, access is controlled from your e-mail box. The confirmation e-mail sent to you by Return Path features a link that takes you directly to your Account Manager. By saving this e-mail, you preserve your secure account access.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What happens if I lose the e-mail allowing access to my Return Path account information?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have lost the e-mail providing the link to your account, you will need to request new access information for your Account Manager. The necessary link for account access will be sent to your current e-mail address after you visit the Address Manager section of the Return Path web site.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Where do I go to give feedback on the Return Path service?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>We appreciate your feedback. If you have any comments, please send them to <A HREF="mailto:feedback@returnpath.net">feedback@returnpath.net.</A><BR>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Who do I contact if I have additional questions?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have questions, please contact us at <A HREF="mailto:support@returnpath.net">support@returnpath.net.</A> We will get back to you with an answer promptly.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Once I sign up for the Return Path service, how long does the service last?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">Your account with Return Path will remain active unless you unsubscribe. This means that you will continue to have the ability to keep in contact with your friends, family, and business associates that look for you from your old e-mail address.</P>



<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>How do I unsubscribe from Return Path?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK><P ALIGN="LEFT">If you no longer want Return Path to help you stay connected at your new e-mail address, you can unsubscribe by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any of the e-mails you have received from us. Or, you can unsubscribe through your Return Path Address Manager.</P>
