<P ALIGN="LEFT">I had an old acquaintance over for a few hours on Thursday. This was the telling hour for him as he was here to 
try and decide (<I>once and for all</I>) to either remain with his Amigas - an A1200 and nice A4k desktop - or go pc. 
(<I>Second person I've seen with the same predicament in past few weeks</I>). He wanted to compare both machines 
side by side and if possible, task for task. While we waited for the transfer of a master's contents over into a 
Seagate slave, I checked the emails sitting on the server, deleted some "<B>Spam</B>" then downloaded those 
deemed as being acceptable. In nanoseconds the various letters popped into their pre-appointed folders and 
then I opened up those from ASA. We read through the emails and then a simple comment from Garry got us 
into that old debate about "going over to the "<B>dark side</B>".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I tried to explain to Gordon what Garry meant by this term and how people interpreted such action. Not ever 
being a member of any Amiga group he was totally unaware of the depth of ill feeling there used to be between 
users of different computer platforms. I explained how people were actually ostracised if they even mentioned 
that they were contemplating a change over to PC. Sometimes, all hell was let loose and tempers were frayed if 
one decided to abandon the Amiga. I informed him that people used to flame each other via email and tempers 
would run high and on occasions people even got expelled from groups and mailing lists. Screeds of Anglo 
Saxon expletives would pepper the emails and rather than "<B>sign out</B>" with their usual signature, people often 
finished with the descriptive FU ya bass.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Looking back, such actions seems so puerile and senseless but it did at least demonstrate the depth of feeling 
some people could possess for inanimate objects such as the Amiga. Or did it?</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I suspect it was probably more to do with someone having an unhealthy intolerance of other people's 
preferences and opinions - but these people sometimes hid behind the veil of "<B>just a staunch loyal follower of 
the Amiga".  Dangerous!</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">My friend agreed.
"<I>And how would your friends on ASA feel if you print my story Peter?</I>" he asked.
"<I>I`ll post it up, then we'll take it from there</I>" I suggested.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's now early Saturday afternoon (<B>12/10/2002</B>) and yesterday I spent the best part of my day sitting at the 
dining room table. I had covered the highly polished walnut with a few thick table covers to act as protection 
because this large piece of furniture now had various computer components scattered all over it. Gordon had 
made his mind up. He came to the conclusion that the time had come to give up on the Amiga and so, he had 
driven down to Hawick where he purchased some components from Alistair the pc man. The prices were good 
and now in front of me were such things as blue fronted pc case with 300+watt AC/DC power supply, large 
cooler fan, Jet mobo, GeForce gfx card, Athlon CPU and modem etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gordon not being the DIY type suffered from technofear - a common complaint.  I therefore volunteered to 
assemble his new pc for him. Within a short space of time, I had set up the various parts and  was now 
awaiting the installation of the hard drive. In his excitement Gordon had for some reason forgotten to buy a hard 
drive while down in Hawick  (<I>pity because Alistair`s prices were very low</I>) so now he had to drive along to 
Shawlands to get one. He returned 40 minutes or so later with a new 20GIG-(<B>£38</B>) Quantum ide hard drive and 
in it went. All cables were checked and when I switched it on, everything powered up as normal. Less than an 
hour later, MSWindowsXP Home version was up and running. All I had to do then was show him how to set up 
the internal modem properly and then I set up drivers for his printer. I tested the ports and set up a temp driver 
so that I could do a test print via my own printer. It all worked as planned. I finished off by setting up some User 
Accounts for him and his family. If by chance he need further help, then he knew that he could always phone 
me. Valerie came in and informed us that our evening meal was awaiting us in the kitchen, so we tore ourselves 
away from the new computer, washed and dined.</P>

"<B>Are you happy with your decision?</B>" I asked him later.<BR>
"<B>Absolutely</B>" he replied after downing the last of the red vino.<BR>
"<B>Going to sell your A4k now then?</B>"  <BR>  
 Gordon looked over at me and smiled. "<B>You bet, I've had enough of the Amiga</B>".<BR>
I knew what he meant. He wasn't being disloyal; he was just being honest. <BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gordon had been with the Amiga for good many years now and a few months back, his PicassoIV blew. I had 
given him a PII to fill in while he searched for a replacement but then, the inevitable happened, the A4k`s power 
supply died. Analogic could possibly get one but he was unsure to spend just under £100 on a mere power 
supply. Then curses upon curses, his CyberStormII started throwing wobblies - followed by it not being 
recognised by the system on a number of occasions. Within 2 days, it too died a death. I had already replaced 
minor things like led power lights and floppy etc on his A4k but could do nothing for him in the way of repairs 
regarding the accelerator or Picasso card. Repairs (if possible) for these items would no doubt prove costly. His 
Microvitec monitor then took a doze of the shingles along the right hand side of the screen and other strange 
things started to happen within the tube. I checked for loose wires or dust shortings but could not locate the 
source of the strange crackling sounds emanating from inside the monitor. It did not look good and with each 
passing day, Gordon was getting more and more despondent. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That was why he asked to come round and see my (<I>somewhat shrinking</I>) computer collection.
Being an owner, he already knew the capabilities of a well-specified A4k but he was surprised to see the high 
quality a simple A2k could produce. My main A2000 has a PIV installed alongside a Blizzard 060-50 SCSI 
accelerator. The MIPs on this baby can near match my old CyberStormIII`s performance so this glorified 32bit 
500 (<B>A2000</B>) is one mean machine - and that's why I keep it. With its HyperComZ30 I/O zorro unit and Robotics 
Courier modem, it was by far the fastest non-ADSL modem set-up available. My Pace modem is very swift but 
the Courier is lightning fast.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He liked sitting down at the A2k and commented on how he preferred the heavy-duty keyboard as opposed to 
those feather-light pc efforts. Then I powered up the 2 pcs  (<B>Win98 and XP</B>) via a Dell (<B>Trinitron</B>) 17" and a NEC 
MultiSyncXV15 monitors. There was a definite sea change.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gordon was impressed with my self -built Athlon 1,200mhz, Gigabyte mobo and Gforce gfx card machine but 
he was totally bowled over by my newly built super cooled XP1800Mhz Athlon via Jet mobo and Gforce running 
XP Windows Home edition. He was instantly converted.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I invited him to sit down and wander through some of the programs then a little later, I ran the XP Demo. His 
eyes flashed with excitement and after glancing quickly over at the  Amiga OS and Win98 screens, he stared 
at the XP and exclaimed. "<I>I really like this Peter, could you build one like this for me. I don't think I`ll want to go 
back to the Amiga-ever again</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I must admit that inside, I felt an element of guilt. Had I put another stake into the heart of Amiga?  "<B>Are you 
sure you want a pc Gordon?</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Absolutely sure. Build one for me soon please</I>" he said rather boyishly.
He was very eager to own a unit similar to mine and after he pestered me a little, I eventually complied with his 
wishes. Tomorrow he would go and get the parts and within a day or so he would become the proud owner of a 
new 1800Mhz XP pc. He appeared happy.</P>

"<I>Any guilt?</I>" I asked him.<BR>
His eyebrows furrowed a little "<B>Whatever for Peter?</B>" he asked innocently. <BR>
"<I>Exactly</I>" I thought to myself. <BR>
