<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Well in the last issue of the "Tales from the Buffet" We read some
amusing (But True) stories of the Inverness to Wick line. However
Inverness Depot had many trains that provided Catering, and
Stewards (In particular New Stewards) were moved around to ensure
they were fully trained in all aspects of the Train Catering
Operation. The favourite Training ground was </I><FONT COLOR=WHITE>:-</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Arriving in the Station at the Booking on time of 09.30am. The
Stores had to be checked ..Transported to the Restaurant car,
Stored aboard, Tables set (<I>Linen & Cutlery</I>) all in time for the
10.30 departure.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As soon as the Wheels started turning, The Buffet car section was
opened for Snacks & Light refreshments, A corridor service of
Coffee & Sandwiches/Biscuits was offered and the Restaurant car was
opened for a service of Morning Coffee.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the Duration of the Trip from Inverness to London (<I>Euston</I>) The
corridor service was offered several times the Buffet remained
open until 30 minutes prior to our arrival, and the Busy restaurant
car served <FONT COLOR=WHITE>:-</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Arriving back in Inverness at 20.30pm ...A good 2 days of frantic
work.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now by far the busiest time for the Catering crew was the Final
sitting of Dinner on the South Bound Journey. We hit Birmingham at
18.00 hours and picked up a lot of Business Passengers (<I>all
requiring Dinner</I>) on the way back to London.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The main problem was down to the volume of Traffic at London
Euston, The Station Crew tried to clear the Platforms as Quickly
as Possible, Therefore if the Catering Crew were held up (<I>For
whatever reason</I>) They ended up lost in some obscure <B>"Kilburn"</B>
sidings ...So the final 30 minutes of the journey were frantic.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Normally everything went to plan, However there was one regular
Customer (<I>Never did know his name</I>) who was an absolute Nightmare.
He was a business man but played the old Railway trick. Passengers
buying a Second Class rail Ticket are allowed to use the First
Class Restaurant car ...So many business people save a little
expenses by buying a second class ticket but travelling the
Journey on the Restaurant car ...This gentleman was one of them
...And he ensured that he stretched out his meal, So he was JUST
finished upon arrival.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He was actually notorious among Catering Crews, He would sit by
himself at a table ,Slowly sipping his Soup while in between
Spoonfuls reading either his Newspaper or various documents. God
help the Steward that tried to remove his plate, Should there
still be a spoonful of soup therein.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He was actually a nasty spiteful character who verbally abused the
Catering staff and treated us like personal servants, The problem
was he was a great tipper ...Regardless of his complaining, prior
to leaving the Train he would slip the Chief Steward a £5 tip.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On one particular trip I was on Board, Old Moaning face was there
as normal, Thankfully he had demolished his Soup and Main Course,
But was taking ages with his Sweet Dish.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We had served everyone else ...Cleaned up ... Completed our
Stocksheets, Changed out of our catering Uniforms, and he was
still sitting there with his dammed Newspaper and a full bowl of
Apple Pie and Cream.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The train Guard had already announced <B>"5 minutes to London Euston"</B>
Still he didn't move ...Fearing a trip to the Sidings, The Chief
Steward told <B>ME</B> to go and ask him to vacate the Restaurant car. An
order I really complained bitterly about, But I was the Newest
Steward on Board, Therefore expendable to the rest of the Crew, If
that guy Chews your head off ...No Problemo ...We can manage
without you ...Now Go and do what your told.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well .. We were pulling into Euston by now ...So fearfully and
expecting a load of Verbal Abuse ..I approached the Guy and
gently placed my hand on his shoulder and leant forward to talk
to him.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Imagine my surprise when he fell forward and landed face down in
his Apple Pie and Cream.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Dead as a Dodo</B> ... Slipped away quietly between his main course
and his Sweet.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Massive Heart attack ... Died instantly we were told later.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now not only did we have to remain onboard until interviewed by the
Police, We had to wait for the Body to be removed, Try to explain
how someone can die in front of you and you still continue to
serve him food ...Yup ...We ended up in the Sidings ...Then the
Railway Police office ...Not getting to our Hotel until the early
hours of the Morning.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As if that wasn't bad enough ... The Chief Steward informed us<FONT COLOR=WHITE> (a)
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>The guy hadn't left a tip .. <FONT COLOR=WHITE>(b)<FONT COLOR=AQUA> He hadn't even paid for his meal,
But the Chief had already put it through his books (<I>Which were now
in the hands of the Police, and couldn't be changed</I>) So the cost
of his Final Meal had to come out of <B>OUR</B> Tips.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm not sure if he went to Heaven or Hell ..But I'm sure he
enjoyed the Irony of his parting.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now train catering Staff work according to a Two Week roster, So
normally you could plan your Home life. However each week you
would have a shift  Known as "<B>Depot".</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Simply this shift involved arriving in your home Station <B>"Prior"</B>
to the Departure of the First catering Vehicle (<I>06.10am</I>) and
visiting each service until till the last departure at 12.30pm.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Should any of the Catering Crew fail to turn up for their
designated shift, You took that shift for the day.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Normally this was not to bad, But every Monday/Wednesday and
Friday you had the notorious <B>CLANSMAN</B> to cover.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Try to imagine your shift reads Fri-Depot ...Sat-Off ...Brilliant,
But should someone fail to turn up for the Clansman ...You were
off to London for Two days ..Returning home completely Knackered
and having to face your irate Wife, Wanting to know why you stood
her up for Auntie Jeans Birthday Party.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was one occasion that sticks in my mind, I was rostered to
the Clansman Friday/Saturday ...But another Crewman called in
Sick. The unfortunate Depot Steward had to fill in, His first time
on board the Clansman ...Big Jim was non to happy.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now when we arrived in London, We stayed overnight in a Hotel just
up from Euston (<I>Sound good doesn't it</I>). Sadly the Railway had a
Knack of finding "Doss Houses" that were Hotels in name only,
Often not fit for Human habitation.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Tales and stories on these overnight Hotels were horrendous
(<I>And mostly true</I>) ..For example.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Regular Stewards only had Coffee & Toast for breakfast (<I>preferring
to eat onboard the Train</I>) ...No wonder ..I did try the Breakfast
once in the Hotel .. It had been plated and under the Heat lamps
for at least a Week. Now I'm not adverse to having my Bacon
slightly Crispy, But this stuff was lethal, Try sticking your fork
into it and a Spray to Bacon Shrapnel shot out from your plate.
The Fried eggs looked Wonderful .... Nice and White, with a Golden
Yellow Yolk ...Sadly they had the Texture of a ceramic tile and
not even the Sharpest of Knives would penetrate the hard skin.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Regular Stewards went straight to their designated room and Felt
the Bed sheet ...If it was slightly warm ..You knew why ..The
Sleeping car crews stayed in the same hotel ..And the warmth meant
some guy had just crawled out of the Sheets you were crawling
into.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps the worst thing about these <B>"Hotels"</B> was that they were
infested with Cockroaches ....<B>BIG COCKROACHES.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We soon got to know that you Put your shoes and clothes as high as
possible (<I>away from the Floor</I>) ..Anyone who has put on their shoes
in the morning and heard that ominous crunching sound will know
what i mean. In fact you always put your shoes on the Bedside
Cabinet, So should you need the Toilet during the Night, The first
thing you put on was your shoes ...<B>Crunch ...Crunch</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The annoying thing about Cockroaches is you have difficulty
finding the Little Buggers during he Day ...At night a different
story ..The floor is suddenly a heaving mass of them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OK ...Back to Big Jim ...A large lad of some 14 stones, But a guy
that hated any sort of Insect ... Jim had been wound up all day
about these "Roaches" and the fact he was unhappy at being
Shanghaied over the weekend, His mood in not improve on the way
South.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>AS</B> soon as we arrived at our Hotel Jim shot up to check-out his
room ...It didn't take him long to spot a Cockroach hiding behind
the Curtains.</P>

<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now despite his dread of Insects big Jim was determined he would
sort out this problem, So bravely he trapped the Roach in and
Empty Matchbox and after calling the rest of the Crew ...Headed
for the Reception Desk.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Big Jims banging on the desk attracted <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Tony"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> The Chinese
Nightporter. </font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>I Want to speak to the Manager</B> ..Screamed Big Jim.</P>

<I>No here ...No here</I> ... replied Tony

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Well WHO'S in charge</B> ...Demanded Jim</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Tony scuttled through the back and returned with<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "Ben"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> the
Under manager ...A massive African Gentleman that made Big Jim look
like a dwarf.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU</B> ...Boomed Ben.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jim said ...<B>Look at THIS</B> ...And opened his Matchbox ..The Cockroach scurried out 
of it Prison and legged it across the desk top.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>HOI!</B>...... Screamed Ben ...Picking up a heavy Desk ledger and crunching
it down on top of the poor Cockroach.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can't bring <B>THAT</B> in Here ...Said Ben ...Pointing to a notice
that Proudly stated</P></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As Ben and Tony disappeared behind the Reception area, Big Jim's
face was Beetroot red his Mouth moved but the Words wouldn't come,
Small specks of spit sprang from his silent lips.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He was a very quiet Steward on our return trip<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <B>:)</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>
