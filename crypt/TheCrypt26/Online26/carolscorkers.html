<P ALIGN="LEFT">Panic gripped the streets of Aberdeen this morning when patches of
sky  took  on  an  unusual blue color and a ball of fire  appeared
above the city.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  phenomenon,   known  as <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><B>'The Sun'</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>,   and  commonly  found  in
Mediterranean countries such as Greece and England,   unleashed  a
terrifying  heat  and  brightness upon  the  city,   causing  many
ordinary  Aberdonians to tear off their hats and  scarves  in  mid
July,   while  motorists were able to turn  their  headlights  <B>AND</B>
wipers fully off.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some  feared that they would be scalded or blinded by 'The  Sun's'
intense radiation of heat and light.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jack McConnell,  speaking from a Sun-proof bunker lying deep under
Aberdeen's King St.  urged people to be calm and return to work as
normal,   stating: <FONT COLOR=NAVY> "<I>We've seen this sort  of  thing  before,   it
happened once in 1947 and we put it down to the war</I>"<FONT COLOR=BLACK>.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=NAVY><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Fearing  it could lead to a break out of cheerful,  happy  smiling
he  said <FONT COLOR=NAVY> "<I>Don't worry it will never last,  it can't.  Our natural
Siberian climate with its force '9's,  ferocious chill factor  and
horizontal rain will soon put paid to these shenanigans.  Aberdeen
will  soon be freed from this terrifying situation and we can  all
return to our natural drab,  downbeat selves complaining  all  the
time and being suspicious about everything.</I><FONT COLOR=BLACK>"</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=NAVY><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">No sooner had the apparition occurred,  than a large, dark ominous
cloud  moved  in  from Ellon,  covering the city  and  efficiently
blocking out the horrible, dangerous sun.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  familiar  horizontal driving rain made a welcome  return  and
once  again the cafe's along the sea front reinstated their  usual
metal  shutters to protect themselves from the pounding they  take
as the sea crashes down to top of them in summer.</P>

<FONT COLOR+BLUE><CENTER>Still, it wasn't as cold, drab or depressing as Peterhead.</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A scouser walked into the local job centre, marched straight up to
the counter and said "<B>Hi, I'm lookin' for a job</B>".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The man behind the counter replied "<I>Your timing is amazing.  We've
just  got  a  listing  from  a   very  wealthy  man  who  wants  a
chauffeur/bodyguard for his nympho daughter.</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>You'll  have  to  drive around in a big black  mercedes,   uniform
provided. Because of the long hours of this job meals will also be
provided and you will also be required to escort the young lady on
her overseas holidays. The salary package is £200,000 a year"</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The scouser said "<B>You're bullsh*tting me!</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The man behind the counter said "<I>Well you f*ckin' started it!</I>"</P>

things people actually said in court,  word for word,  taken  down

these are excellent - don't miss the last one.</P>
