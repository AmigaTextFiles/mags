<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1591,  a Scottish schoolteacher, John Fian, of Prestonpans near
Edinburgh,   was  implicated   in  what  David  Pickering  in  his
Dictionary  Of Witchcraft said was "<B>Scotland's most  famous  witch
trial</B>".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Fian  was identified as the leader of the coven that was  alleged
to  have plotted the death of James VI of Scotland (later James  I
of England)," Pickering said.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"On  26  December  that year he was arrested  on  the  charges  of
witchcraft and high treason."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The indictment was nothing if not fanciful, said Pickering.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"(He)   had worshipped Satan in North Berwick church,  had allowed
himself to be transported to various mountains while in a  trance,
had  robbed  graves for ingredients to be used  in  a  variety  of
spells,   had  broken into houses by breathing on  locks  to  open
them,  had flown through the air by magic,  had raised storms, had
cast  horoscopes and had seduced a widow through the use  of  love
charms."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was nothing fanciful about Fian's pre-trial treatment,  said
Pickering, as the pain was very real.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"The  first stage in his torture was a procedure known as thawing,
which  involved the victim being jerked roughly about by means  of
a rope securely tied around his head.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"After  an  hour of this abuse had elicited no response  from  the
accused  the  torturers switched to the infamous boots,   crushing
Fian's  legs  three  times in succession before the  schoolteacher
lost consciousness.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"This lapse into senselessness was blamed as a trick by the  Devil
to escape further pain, and Fian was searched for charms.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Two  pins  were  discovered  stuck  into  his  tongue  (they  had
probably been put there by the gaolers themselves).
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Using  a  pair  of  pincers called a turkas,  the schoolteacher's
fingernails  were broken and pulled off,  after  which  the  whole
length of two needles was forced into the bloodied nailbeds up  to
and beyond the first joint, causing the most excruciating pain.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Incredibly, Fian still refused to confess that he was a witch.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Recourse was made once more to the boots,  and Fian's  legs  were
crushed to the point where 'the blood and marrow spouted forth  in
great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever'.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Although denied the convenience of a confession ...   on  one  of
the  last  Saturdays   of   January   1591  he  was  strangled  on
Edinburgh's Castle Hill and then burned as a witch ..."</P>
