<P ALIGN="LEFT">A fourth-grade teacher was giving her pupils a lesson in
logic.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Here is the situation,</I>" she said. "<I>A man is standing 
up in a boat in the middle of a river, fishing. He loses his 
balance, falls in, and begins splashing and yelling for 
help. His wife hears the commotion, knows he can't swim, and 
runs down to the bank.</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A group of attorneys had to measure the height of a flag 
pole for evidence to support a lawsuit. They went out to the 
flagpole with ladders and a tape measure. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They proceed to fall off the ladders and drop the tape 
measure, the whole thing was just a mess. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An engineer comes along and sees what they're trying to do. 
He walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it 
flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurements to 
one of the attorneys and walks away. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After the engineer has gone, one attorney turns to another 
and laughs. <FONT COLOR=LIME>"Isn't that just like an engineer. We're looking 
for the height, and he gives us the length"</font></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, as 
if you just pulled the plug on a loved one.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You spend half of the plane trip with your laptop on your 
lap... and your child in the overhead compartment.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You decide to stay in college for an additional year or two, 
just for the free Internet access.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You laugh at people with 28.8-baud modems.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You start using smileys :) in your snail mail.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You find yourself typing "com" after every period when using 
a word processor.com</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You refer to going to the bathroom as downloading.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You check your mail. It says "no new messages." So you check 
it again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Freddie Mercury, Gianni Versace and the Queen Mum arrive at
the Pearly gates. St Peter explains that only one can get
through and that they each have to put forward their case
for entry.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Freddie says,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "I know I haven't led a perfect life and I've 
made some mistakes along the way, but I've made some of the 
most beautiful music in the world. I'll stand at the back of 
heaven and serenade everybody with my wondrous songs, making
heaven a happier place to be."</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

Pete, if you look good you will feel good and that will make
heaven a happier place."</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>
