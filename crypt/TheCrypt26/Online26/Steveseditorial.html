<blockquote><FONT COLOR=AQUA>After our last edition of the magazine, I went on 
  holiday to Majorca, with the knowledge that another issue was still 2 months 
  away, so I had plenty of time to relax and enjoy the sun. Then what do I find 
  as soon as I return? Our beloved Editor wants to get the next issue out in 3 
  weeks! "What? Are you crazy?" are some of the things I said to him. :)<br>
  <br>
  So here we are three weeks later and we managed it. Not only do we have another packed edition for you, but we also have another exclusive! 
  (We're to good to you) Along with our feature section on Broadband Britain. (And thanks to those that took part in our questionaire) We have an 
  exclusive interview with a company on the frontline of Broadband technology, SatDrive. We all know that BT are dragging their heals getting this 
  service to all the Country, so what do you do if your not in the catchment areas that are fortunate enough to get Broadband? You turn to
  companies like SatDrive, who can get you a very fast connection no matter where you live, great news for the 40% of the population that BT thinks are not worthy.</font>  <br><br>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Starting with this issue, the Crypt is moving to it's own dedicated server. So everything will be in the same place. Until now we have relied on the generousity of 
  other hosting bits of the magazine. So in the next few weeks I will be moving it all to the new home, so there might be a little disruption on the way, but I will try to keep it to a minimum.</FONT><br><br>
  <FONT COLOR=AQUA>If an article catches your eye, or there`s something that you 
  disagree with in the </font><font color=red>Crypt</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> then 
  write to us and let us know, we like to hear from you and will reply to all 
  of them. </font></blockquote>
