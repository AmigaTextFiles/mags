<P ALIGN="LEFT">Stay  online and in touch with BuzMe's free Internet call  waiting
and voicemail service.  BuzMe,  which works on your existing phone
number,   allows you to receive and respond to phone  calls  while
online.   Complete with caller ID and your own private  voicemail,
it's  a must-have for single-phone-line Internet users.  As  calls
come  in,  BuzMe delivers them to your desktop and tells you who's
calling.  You may then go offline and take the call,  type a text-
to-speech  reply that is read to the caller,   send  the  call  to
voicemail, or reject it, all with just a few mouse clicks.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Plus,   BuzMe's voicemail operates as a regular telephone  company
message center,  taking and storing your messages.  You may  check
your  stored  voice messages via the telephone or the  Web.   Your
Microsoft  Outlook Contacts can be imported into  BuzMe's  address
book,   and BuzMe's call log stores the phone numbers of  everyone
who calls you.</P>
