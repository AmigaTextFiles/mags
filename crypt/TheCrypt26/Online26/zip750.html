<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Iomega Zip</B> drives have, for quite a number of years, Been a excellent storage medium for your personal files or as a quick and easy back-up format. The original <B>Zip 100</B>, Often described as a Large Floppy Disk replacement, Was quickly overshadowed by the <B>Zip 250</B>. The latter allowed you to store a massive 250 megabytes of material on a single disk, and often used as an extra harddrive, Or a simple means of transferring files between computers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With modern day Computers requiring more and more Storage space, It was parhaps inevitable that <B>Iomega</B> would have to increase the storage capacity of their <B>Zip Drives</B>.</P>
