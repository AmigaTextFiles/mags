<blockquote>
  Seeking well-deserved rest and relaxation, Mario and Princess Peach travel 
    to a beautiful remote island.<br>
   It is said the local citizens are friendly and the weather forecast suggests 
    year-round sunshine. <br>
	However, when they get to the island, they quickly find 
    out that the peaceful paradise has been polluted by a mysterious stranger.<br> 
    Worse still, the individual bears a striking resemblance to Mario! <br>
	Determined 
    to clear his reputation and clean up the island, Mario sets off on his greatest 
    adventure yet.<br>
	 Discover the first Mario title for Nintendo GameCube, developed 
    by a team under the supervision of Mario's celebrated creator Shigeru Miyamoto. <br>
    Explore the game's colorful 3-D world, filled with expansive environments. <br>
    Restore the power of Shine to keep the island clean.<br>
	 Wash away island mess 
    to restore the community to its pristine condition using Mario's new water 
    pump device.<br>
	 Perform a number of different jumps, bounce off walls, run, slide, 
    climb, and fly to the highest reaches - more mobility than ever before.<br>
	 Bask 
    in cheery graphics, real-time lighting effects and stunning reflections that 
    bathe the island in sunshine.<br>
	 Visit Yoshi, Toad and a host of other friends 
    as Mario encounters a collection of enemies bent on foiling his efforts to 
    restore the island. <br><br>
