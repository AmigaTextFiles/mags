<P ALIGN="LEFT">The teacher wants her students to make a sentence with the word
<FONT COLOR=WHITE>'fascinate'.</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The first little girl raises her hand and says, 'My family and I went to the
zoo and I found it fascinating.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">'That's very good but I want the word<FONT COLOR=WHITE> fascinate.'</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Another one says, 'My father and I went to the movies and I was fascinated.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">'That's also very good but I want the word<FONT COLOR=WHITE> fascinate.'</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Johnny raises his hand but the teacher hesitates because he has a
foul mouth and usually says nasty things but she figures he can't very well
mess up this word. 'Go ahead Johnny', she says.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Johnny says, 'My sister has a sweater with ten buttons but her boobs are so
big she can only<FONT COLOR=WHITE> fasten 8.'</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A small tourist hotel was all abuzz about an afternoon wedding where the
groom was 95 and the bride was 23. The groom looked pretty feeble and the
feeling was that the wedding night might kill him, because his bride was a
healthy, vivacious young woman. But lo and behold, the next morning, the
bride came down the main staircase slowly, step by step, hanging onto the
banister for dear life.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She finally managed to get to the counter of the little shop in the hotel.
The clerk looked really concerned,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<I>Whatever happened to you, honey? You
look like you've been wrestling an alligator!</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The bride groaned, hung on to the counter and managed to speak,</P>

<FONT COLOR=LIME><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Ohhh God! He told me he'd been saving up for 75 years, and I thought he
meant his money!!"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Two hunters from Alabama are out in the woods when one of them falls to the
ground. He does not appear to be breathing. The other whips out his mobile
phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps out to the operator,<FONT COLOR=LIME> "<I>My
friend is dead! What can I do?</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The operator, in a calm soothing voice, says, <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"Calm down. Just take it easy.
First let's make sure he's dead."</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the
line. He says,<FONT COLOR=LIME> "<I>Okay, now what?</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">One of my friends works in the customer service call center of a national
pager company. He deals with the usual complaints regarding poor pager
operation, as well as the occasional crank caller demanding to be paged less
often, more often, or by more interesting people. The best call came from a
man who repeatedly complained that he keeps being paged by "<B>Lucille.</B>" He was
instructed that he would have to call her and tell her to stop paging him.</P>
<FONT COLOR=SILVER>
"<I>She don't never leave no number, so I can't call her back,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After three such calls, someone thought to ask how he knew it was Lucille if
she didn't leave a number.</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>She leaves her name</I>,"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> was the reply.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After establishing that the customer had a numericonly pager, the light bulb
came on.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<B>How does she spell her name?</B>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> the service rep asked.

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">"L-O-W C-E-L-L"</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Another problem solved.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A Brunette, a Redhead, and a Blonde escape a burning building by climbing to
the roof. Firemen are on the street below, holding a blanket for them to
jump in.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The firemen yell to the Brunette, <FONT COLOR=LIME>"<B>Jump! Jump! It's your only chance to
survive!</B>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> The Brunette jumps and <B>SWISH!</B> The firemen yank the blanket
away...the Brunette slams into the sidewalk like a tomato.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=LIME>"<B>C'mon! Jump! You gotta jump!</B>',FONT COLOR=AQUA> say the firemen to the Redhead.</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Oh no! You're gonna pull the blanket away!"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> says the Redhead.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=LIME>"<B>No! It's Brunettes we can't stand! We're OK with Redheads!</B>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=RED>"OK" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>says the Redhead, and she jumps. SWISH! The firemen yank the blanket
away, and the lady is flattened on the pavement like a pancake.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the Blonde steps to the edge of the roof. Again, the firemen yell
,FONT COLOR=LIME>"<B>Jump! You have to jump!</B>"</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"No way! You're just gonna pull the blanket away!" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>yelled the Blonde.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

,FONT COLOR=LIME>"<B>No! Really! You have to jump! We won't pull the blanket away!</B>"

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Look," <FONT COLOR=AQUA>the Blonde says.<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Nothing you say is gonna convince me that you're
not gonna pull the blanket away! So what I want you to do is put the blanket
down, and back away from it...."</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Gates (CEO of Microsoft), Andy Grove(CEO of Intel) and Jerry Sanders (CEO of
AMD) were in a high-powered business meeting. During the serious, tense
discussions, a beeping noise suddenly is emitted from where Bill is sitting.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bill says,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Oh, that's my emergency beeper. Gentlemen, excuse me, I really
need to take this call.</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> So Bill lifts his wristwatch to his ear and begins
talking into the end of his tie. After completing this call, he notices the
others are staring at him.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bill explains,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>Oh, this is my new emergency communication system. I have an
earpiece built into my watch and a microphone sewn into the end of my tie.
That way, I can a take a call anywhere.</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The others nod, and the meeting continues. Five minutes later, the
discussion is again interrupted when Andy starts beeping. He also states,
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Oh, that is my emergency beeper. Excuse me, gentlemen, this must be an
important call."<FONT COLOR=AQUA> So Andy taps his earlobe and begins talking into thin air.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When he completes his call, he notices the others staring at him and
explains, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"I also have an emergency communication system. But my earpiece is
actually implanted in my earlobe, and the microphone is actually embedded in
this fake tooth. Isn't that neat?"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The others nod, and the meeting continues.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Five minutes later, the discussion is again interrupted when Jerry emits a
thunderous fart. He looks up at the others staring at him and says,<FONT COLOR=WHITE> "Uhh,
somebody get me a piece of paper... I'm receiving a fax."</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>
