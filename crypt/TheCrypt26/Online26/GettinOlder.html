 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Senior citizens are constantly being criticized for every conceivable
 deficiency of the modern world, real or imaginary.</P>
 
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">We know we take responsibility for all we have done
 and do not blame others.</P>
</font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
 <CENTER>BUT, upon reflection, we would like to point out
 that it was NOT the senior citizens who took<FONT COLOR=WHITE><B>

    <CENTER> The melody out of music,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The pride out of appearance,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The romance out of love,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The commitment out of marriage,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The responsibility out of parenthood,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The togetherness out of the family,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The learning out of education,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The service out of patriotism,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The religion out of school,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The Golden Rule from rulers,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The nativity scene out of cities,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The civility out of behavior,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The refinement out of language,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The dedication out of employment,</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The prudence out of spending, or</CENTER>
     <CENTER>The ambition out of achievement,</CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT COLOR=AQUA>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">And we certainly are NOT the ones who eliminated patience and
 tolerance from personal relationships and interactions with others!!</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Does anyone under the age of 50 know all the lyrics to the Star Spangled
 Banner?  Just look at the Seniors with tears in their eyes and pride in their
 hearts as they stand at attention with their hand over their hearts!</P>

 <CENTER>Remember.......</CENTER>

 <CENTER>Inside every older person is a younger person
 wondering what the heck happened!</CENTER>

<CENTER> the life of the party...even if it lasts until 8 p.m.</CENTER>
<BR> 
 <CENTER> I'm very good at opening childproof caps with a hammer.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER> I'm usually interested in going home before I get to where I
    am going.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER> I'm awake many hours before my body allows me to get up.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER> I'm smiling all the time because I can't hear a thing you're
    saying.</CENTER>
<BR>
  <CENTER>I'm very good at telling stories; over and over and over and
    over...</CENTER>
<BR>
  <CENTER>I'm aware that other people's grandchildren are not as cute as
    mine.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER> I'm so cared for -- long term care, eye care, private care,
    dental care.</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I'm not grouchy----- I just don't like traffic, waiting, crowds,
 lawyers, loud music, unruly kids, Toyota commercials, Tom Brokaw, 
 Dan Rather, barking dogs, politicians and a few other things I can't
 remember.</P>

     <CENTER>I'm sure everything I can't find is in a secure place.</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm wrinkled, saggy, lumpy, and that's just my left leg.</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm having trouble remembering simple words like.......</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm realizing that aging is not for wimps.</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm sure they are making adults much younger these days,  and
    when did they let kids become policemen?</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm wondering, if you're only as old as you feel,</CENTER>
    <CENTER>how could I be alive at 150?</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I'm a walking storeroom of facts.....</CENTER>
     <CENTER>I've just lost the key to the storeroom door.</CENTER>
