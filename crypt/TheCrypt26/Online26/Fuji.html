<p>Having been much impressed by the relative quality of the kids’ digital camera, 
  I decided that, this year, before I went on holiday , I would take one of my 
  own.</p>
<p>I reread all the articles and reviews in ComputerActive magazine, and explored 
  the shops.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the Fuji FinePix 2600z. The “z” at the end is for zoom.</p>
<p>This is a digital camera that actually looks like a real camera, you know what 
  I mean, don’t you?</p>
<p>A lot of the new digital cameras have experimented with the shape of the camera 
  and , call me old fashioned, but I prefer a camera to actually look like one.</p>

<p>The 2600 is a 2 mega pixel camera . It comes in its box with a carry strap, 
  charger, rechargeable batteries and a CD with the necessary software to install 
  the drivers required to download to your computer. It also contains a little 
  USB lead ( USB to usb2)</p>
<p>The software is nice and easy to install and drivers , once installed , enable 
  you to either download or use as a web camera. There is web conferencing software 
  included as well. The camera is ready to use, more or less, once you open the 
  box, since it also comes with a 16mb SmartMedia card.</p>
<p>The software for viewing the pictures is FinePixViewer ………interesting name……..</p>
<p>Viewing is easy and transferring pictures quite fast.</p>
<p>FinePixViewer is a pretty basic package but does do the job.</p>

<p>Images can be resized, cropped and rotated, but you’d be better using an image  
  program. You can also get your pix printed using their internet service.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of the camera is that using SmartMedia, you simply take 
  the card in to a photo processing shop and get the pix put onto CD and then 
  wipe and start again. The cost of this service is around the £5 mark and is 
  generally available everywhere.</p>
<p>All the details about the camera can be found at <a
href="http://www.fujifilm.com/">http://www.fujifilm.com</a></p>
<p>The site has a “Macromedia Flash” part that gives a 360 degree view of the 
  camera, the brochure in Acrobat format and a movie (in various connection speeds) 
  about the camera. Included in the downloads section is an updated version of 
  the FinePix viewer software and the drivers for the USB storage device. A nice 
  site to have a look at if you are deciding about a digital camera…………</p>
<p>One of the reasons I bought the FinePix is because of the good name that the 
  Fuji lens has. Another is the simplicity of use. My wife isn’t particularly 
  interested in technology and so any camera must be point and click <span>J</span></p>

<p>This camera fills all those considerations. The camera , as you can see above 
  in the article , looks like a normal camera. You simply open the lens cover, 
  and press the button to take the picture. White balance, exposure etc are all 
  handled automatically. For those that want, you can switch the camera to manual 
  mode and experiment! The camera has a self timer as well, and a very easy to 
  use GUI for all the settings that can be accessed using the 1.8 inch LCD display 
  on the back of the camera. I normally have the monitor switched off during normal 
  use as it is power hungry. After saying that, battery life is quite good , and 
  the battery life will vary enormously on whether you use the monitor , flash 
  etc. A charge on the batteries is sufficient to fill the 128mb card in normal 
  daylight conditions with the monitor switched off .</p>
<p>So, how well does it take photos?</p>
<p>The answer is, very well. The top resolution on the camera is 1600 x 1200, 
  and I normally stick to that. You can, however, alter this in the settings all 
  the way down to VGA mode. This gives a picture an average filesize around the 
  750k mark in jpeg on top resolution. The zoom feature on the camera is 3x optical 
  zoom and 2.5x digital zoom. I haven’t really experimented with the digital zoom 
  as you have to turn down the resolution to get it. Since I bought a 128mb SmartMedia 
  card at the same time as the camera, I can get 166 pictures on the card at maximum 
  resolution.</p>
<p>Drawbacks………..</p>
<p>Lemme see, I hate using the monitor to line up the photo……..and although you 
  can vary the output from the monitor, it isn’t really all that clever in full 
  sunshine. I tend to use the viewfinder, another throwback to the old days of 
  taking pictures?</p>
<p>Another drawback is the flash. The flash has 4 modes, I believe. But it isn’t 
  really all that powerful. Make sure you are close enough if you are using flash, 
  although the “belly dancer” picture above shows the sort of result you get. 
  Because this is a web page and space is a consideration, you can’t really appreciate 
  how much detail is in the pictures, so here’s the pictures when I crop them……</p>

<p>Not too shabby!!</p>
<p>As you can appreciate by now, I love my little camera. I have taken over a 
  thousand pictures with it so far………and loads more to go. For close-up pictures, 
  you simply switch to “macro” mode. Have a gander at the picture below of the 
  neighbour’s cat.</p>

<p>Why didn’t I use our own cat? Well, its black and doesn’t really look that 
  impressive compared to the rich colours of Sylvester <span>J</span></p>
<p>Here’s another crop ………Sylvester in “sleepy” mode …..heheheheh.</p>

<p>The SmartMedia card I refer to is a small ram card designed for use with the 
  camera.</p>
<p>ComputerActive slated these as being easy to damage, but, touch wood, I haven’t 
  had any problems with it.</p><center>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=415

<p>For the price of the camera (apprx. £200), I find it hard to really find major 
  drawbacks. The quality of photographs is excellent, and you always improve at 
  taking your pix with practise. </p>
<p>The camera is a joy to use, even for the wife, who now has figured out how 
  to navigate the menus. Downloading to the P.C. is a matter of plugging the camera 
  in and clicking save. </p>
<p>I haven’t used the movie part much either…..it saves 20 seconds of video with 
  no sound……so I can’t really see the point of it……..but its another option.</p>
<p>This little camera is packed with quality features. If you’re thinking of taking 
  the plunge into digital photography, I highly recommend this one!!!!</p>
<p>Go see for yourself……….<a
