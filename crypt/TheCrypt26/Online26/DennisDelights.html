 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Eventually you will reach a point when you stop lying about your age
and start bragging about it...</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The older we get, the fewer things seem worth waiting in line for.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people try to turn back their odometers. Not me. I want people
 to know "why" I look this way.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> I've traveled a long way and some of the roads weren't paved.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">How old would you be if you didn't know how old you are?</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you are dissatisfied and would like to go back to youth, think of
Algebra.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">You know you are getting old when everything either dries up or leaks.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">I don't know how I got over the hill without getting to the top.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">One of the many things no one tells you about aging is that it is
 such a nice change from being young.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One must wait until evening to see how splendid the day has been.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Ah, being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Old age is when former classmates are so gray and wrinkled and bald
 they don't recognize you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> If you don't learn to laugh at trouble, you won't have anything to
 laugh at when you are old.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">First you forget names, then you forget faces. Then you forget to
 pull up your zipper, then.... Oh my
 goodness you forgot to pull your zipper down!</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">If you jog in a jogging suit, lounge in lounging pajamas, and smoke
 in a smoking jacket, WHY would anyone want to wear a windbreaker??</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Long ago when men cursed and beat the ground with sticks, it was
 called witchcraft. Today, it's called golf.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A heart-warming story of the advances of women in achieving
 equality throughout the world...</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kabul several
 years before the Afghan conflict. She noted that women
 customarily walked about 10 paces behind their husbands.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">She returned to Kabul recently and observed that the men now
 walked several paces behind their wives.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Ms. Walters approached one of the Afghani women
 and said,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<B>This is marvelous. Can you tell the free world
 just what enabled women to achieve this reversal of roles?</B>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>Land mines,</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>said the woman.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

Their family member lay gravely ill. </P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, the doctor came in
looking Tired and somber. <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news,</I>"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said
as he surveyed the worried faces.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>The only hope left for your loved one
at this time is a brain transplant. It's an experimental procedure,
very risky but it is the only hope. "Insurance will cover the procedure,
 but you will have to pay for the brain yourselves.</I>"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a
 great length of time, someone asked,<FONT COLOR=LIME>"Well, how much does a
 brain cost?" </font></P><FONT COLOR=LIME> 

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The doctor quickly responded,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>$5,000 for a male brain,
 and $200 for a female brain.</I>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile,
 Avoiding eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">A
man, unable To control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted
to ask, <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Why is the male brain so much more?"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained to the
 Entire group,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "<I>It's just standard pricing procedure. We have to mark

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">In a trial, a small town prosecuting attorney called
  his first witness to the stand: a grandmotherly,
  elderly woman.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">He approached her and asked,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Mrs. Jones, do you know
  me?"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

 <FONT COLOR=AQUA> <P ALIGN="LEFT">She responded, <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams.
  I've known you since you were a young boy. And
  frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. You
  lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and
  talk about them behind their backs. You think you're
  a rising big shot when you haven't the brains to
  realize you never will amount to anything more than a
  two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you."</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do,
  he pointed across the room and asked,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Mrs. Jones, do
  you know the defense attorney?"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">She again replied,<FONT COLOR=SILVER> <I>"Why, yes, I do. I've known Mr.
  Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy,
  bigoted, he has a drinking problem. The man can't
  build a normal relationship with anyone and his law
  practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not
  to mention he cheated on his wife with three different
  women. Yes, I know him."</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">The defense attorney almost died!</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">As a young boy, Joe was completely obsessed with tractors. He had
pictures of tractors all over  his bedroom walls; he had tractor toys,
tractor T-shirts, a tractor carpet, and duvet cover, the whole works.
He ate, drank and slept tractors.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On his 17th birthday he was thrilled to get an invitation  to go to a
tractor factory nearby and test-drive a brand new tractor.  His
excitement was incredible as he told his family and friends. The  great
day came and he went to the factory for the test-drive.  Unfortunately
something went terribly wrong with the tractor when Joe  was driving it
and it flipped over, trapping and breaking Joe's leg and  fracturing
his skull. He was so upset and tried to sue the tractor  company for
negligence. But the company would have none of it and told  him there
was no liability and he could get lost!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can  imagine he was rather p****d off with tractors after this
and vowed to  shed them from his life completely and forever. All the
posters came  down, the toys were given away - tractors were <B>GONE</B>.
Many years later,  Joe went into a bar for a drink. Inside, the
cigarette and cigar smoke  was terrible but through it he saw a beautiful
girl
seated at the bar  on her own.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Tears were streaming down her face. Joe asked her what  was wrong and
she said that the smoke was making her eyes sting and  stream with tears.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With that, Joe looked around and then took a  huge breath, sucking in
all the smoke.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He then walked  outside into the car park and blew all the smoke  out
again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He goes back into the bar where the air is now  clear and sweet and
sits down next to the girl. <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>That was  amazing!</I>" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>she said, <FONT COLOR=SILVER>"<I>How did you do
that?</I>"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
