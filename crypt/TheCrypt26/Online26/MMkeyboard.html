   <P ALIGN="LEFT">You like those Windows keyboards with many additional tool buttons  for
   EMail,  WWW,  music and so on? You want to use a wireless keyboard? You
   don´t want to buy expensive hardware that only  supports  the  standard
   keys  and  leaving the others unused? Then you found the right archive!
   For a few bucks you´ll get a selfmade hardware that uses everything!</P>

   <P ALIGN="LEFT">MMKeyboard allows you to use a Windows keyboard as Amiga  keyboard.  In
   addition  to  that  it's possible to launch programs via the multimedia
   buttons.</P>

   <P ALIGN="LEFT">No driver problems like on the PC! One  little  commodity  enables  all
   available non standard keys on any keyboard! Even future keyboards are
   working!</P>

   <P ALIGN="LEFT">Start your music player by pressing the play button on  your  keyboard.
   Eject  your  CDROM by pressing the eject button, or open a Shell in the
   same way! Now it's possible to  execute  any  tool  without  qualifier,
   because  the  keys are unknown to the system! Of course its possible to
   use qualifiers to be more flexible!</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"> In addition to that there are additional features like a real  hardware
   password  with  optional Amiga GUI, full reset handler support and much
   more!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">1.   Press the multimedia key you want to add.  A hex string  (eg.
$80000E032) appears in the Key List.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">2.  A string input field with the same hex string gets active. Try
to select the name by using the
popup gadget behind or enter the name by using the input box.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">3. If there are more multimedia keys to add then proceed with 1.</P>

<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Back in the "MMKeyboard - Main Setup" window we want to setup our first hotkey to start AWeb with the WWW key. Any other
key is doing the job, too! It's just an example.</P>

1. Select "New..." and the "Hotkey Set-Up" window is opening.<BR>
2. Enter a hotkey name like "AWeb" or "starting AWeb".<BR>
3. Press the popup gadget behind the hotkey gadget and a new hotkey window is opening. Now it's time
to press the WWW key with or without qualifier. If the hotkey is correct push the ok button to
continue.<BR>
4. Now it's time to select an action. Choose CLI as exec type.<BR>
5.  Use the popup gadget behind the "command" gadget to select the
AWeb program file.<BR>
6. Press the "use" gadget to store the hotkey.<BR>
7. Proceed with 1. if there are any additional hotkeys to add.<BR>
8. Back in the main window select save.<BR>
9.  Now it's time to test the hotkey. Press the hotkey combination
you defined within section 2.<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Depending  on  your Amiga and your keyboard other  connectors  are
used,   that's the reason the schematic is universal.  Because  of
the  size it's not very easy to solder PS/2 Plugs,  so I recommend
to cut an extender cable.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  shouldn't make the wires to long!  Just use 10cm or  less  on
each  side  should be enough.  You're able to use an  extender  if
required!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  circuit  itself  can  be done  on  a  simple  PCB  tracks  or
completely  without!  Just make sure there aren't  any  shortcuts.
It's  possible to create an interface that isn't much bigger  than
the PIC itself.</P>
