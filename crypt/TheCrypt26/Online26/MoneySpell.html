<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">You  will need:  Several Yellow or Red Onion skins (the dry  outer
skin)  I go to the store and buy 1 onion and fill the bag with the
skins that have fallen off.</P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
 1-green or orange candle & holder<BR>
<BR>
 1-pair of needle nose pliers<BR>
<BR>
 1-lighter or matches<BR>
<BR>
 1-baking sheet or large flat pan<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Assemble  all  items together and then sit in a quite  place  with
the  items before you.  Ask for your Spirit Guides to be with  you
and  say  a  prayer of your choice.  Be thankful and  be  sure  to
visualize yourself as already having your desires.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Now light  the
candle and place the onion skin in the pliers.  Now you are  ready
to  burn the onion skin. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> See in your mind all the money you  have
to burn.  I have given this spell out to many people and have many
confirmations on how well it worked for them.  You can  do  it  as
often  as you like.  </P>










 <FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER>Always end your spell with SO BE IT, AND SO IT IS.</CENTER>
