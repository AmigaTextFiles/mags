<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Convenience Store</B> - the corner shop.  Everyone's got one, quite local to them, 
usually on the corner of the road.  Always there, always open, except when you run 
out of milk at 2am or the cat's just come in and wants feeding, then they're closed.  
We take them for granted, and then moan when they close down because the new 
supermarket that opened recently that's about 2 miles away, has taken all the 
custom, and they can't afford to compete and stay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's not easy to run a little corner shop - ask anyone who's tried it, and they'll tell 
you all about it.  I know, I manage one.  Let me give you an example of a typical 
working day.  Do I hear you say "<I>That's boring</I>"?  Not likely.  Just try this for size.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The shop opens from 7am until 10pm at night, every day, seven days a week, all 
year round.  There's no rest for the wicked - just that I'd like the opportunity to be 
wicked once in a while. <FONT COLOR=WHITE> <B>:-)</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Summer is the time of the Annual Manager's Conference, which is the Company's 
extravaganza to review the trade figures for the past year and to outline plans for 
the forthcoming year.  The conference is held in a different location each year, and 
the venue is sumptuous.  This year's conference venue was no exception.  The 
location was.  We were off to sunny Blackpool?!!  A previous conference had been 
held there a few years before, and fellow managers who had attended then 
reported that a fine time had been had by all, and the weather had been superb.  
Not so, this year, unfortunately.  The weather at home had been typical for the 
time of year, but dry and warm. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">During a meeting of the managers for the area, we had decided that taking a train 
would be easier and far less hassle than driving to Blackpool.  A block booking of 
reserved seats had been made from Birmingham New Street, leaving individual 
managers to find their respective way to Birmingham to connect with the Blackpool 
train.  This meant for the majority of us to catch the London Euston train to 
Birmingham New Street.  Packed and ready to go, I phoned a taxi to the station, 
and purchased my ticket to Birmingham with no difficulty with plenty of time to 
spare.  When the train arrived, it was packed, with standing room only.  Sardines 
have a better life in a tin.  Luckily, some passengers left at the next stop, vacating 
seats and I was able to grab one.  Just as well, as new passengers boarded to take 
the place of the disembarking, only twice as many came on board!!  There were 
two more stops just like this, leaving some of the last left waiting for the next train.  
Why?  TWO previous trains had been cancelled, leaving very disgruntled passengers 
and an overcrowded train.  Mass disembarking at Birmingham New Street meant a 
very crowded platform.  All I have to do is find the rest of my party.  Once the 
platform had cleared, I start to look.  No meeting place had actually been 
arranged, but first choice seemed to be the platform from which the Blackpool train 
would leave.  For those who have never visited Birmingham New Street, this is a 
very large complex involving many stairs, and ranks of screens announcing the 
current/next trains on each platforms.  This, along with the constant passing of 
commuters, is perplexing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I establish the fact that the train will be leaving from Platform 6 in 30 minutes, but 
none of my party is there, yet.  So a further trip up the stairs to the waiting room 
is in order.  Three of the party are already there, having arrived on the same train 
as I, but, due to the volume of passengers, we had missed each other.  Others 
arrived shortly afterwards, and sustenance was purchased for the journey.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Shortly before the train was due, most of the party had arrived.  We made our way 
onto the correct platform hoping to find the remaining members there.  Luckily, we 
did.  Sighs of relief all round.  A few minutes later, our train arrived and we 
headed for the correct carriage to find our reserved seats.  We found however, that 
our seats were not all together, but spaced out down one side of the carriage, and 
one member was in a totally different carriage altogether!   As the train would be 
taking us to Preston, and was, at present, virtually empty, we all sat together.  Then 
came the fun.  As we stopped at other stations, people began to claim their seats, 
and so began the hunt for our correct ones.  Unfortunately for two of us, (one 
being myself), our seats were taken by an elderly couple, who couldn't see very 
well.  So, instead of disturbing them, we sat somewhere else, until they were 
claimed.  Eventually, we appeared to have no choice in disturbing their slumber, 
until we hit on a bright idea.  We just switched the tickets on the back of their seats 
over from theirs to ours.  We had grown tired of continually swapping, and this 
seemed to be the fair way.  Luckily for us, the ticket inspector agreed when he 
came round, and we were left in peace for the rest of the journey.  A change at 
Preston involved a wait of 15 minutes between trains, so a cigarette break was 
grabbed for those who required it, followed by a clamber onto the connecting train 
on a different platform, and we were on the final stretch of the journey.  It had 
started to rain just before Preston, and the sky was very grey over Blackpool which 
did not bode well.  By the time we reached Blackpool, the rain was hammering 
down, and we had no idea where the hotel was in relation to the station, so we 
scurried to the taxi rank and piled into two large taxis, giving the hotel as our 
destination.  The hotel turned out to be only three minutes drive away, but it saved 
us getting a soaking!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We all piled into the hotel, leaving the taxi drivers knowing there was a conference 
there and hoping there would be more delegates coming from the station.  Was 
Blackpool ready for us all?  We were in high spirits, having successfully arrived, and 
we went to book in.  As we were early, there was a minimal queue and booking-in 
went smoothly.  We were given a large brown envelope, a large, plain white T-
shirt, a bulging carrier bag and a large black leatherlook folder with the conference 
year, name and hotel logo in gold on the front - very swish!  Inside the envelope 
was a name badge, brief agenda, and a table seating plan for the Tuesday night's 
Gala Dinner.  Checking through it, I found three of us had been separated from the 
rest of our party onto another table, with other managers of which we knew no-
one.  At least there were three of us, unlike last year, when I was placed on a table 
where I knew only one other person!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After a welcome cup of coffee, we had very little to do until we were issued with 
our key-cards for the rooms, as we had arrived very early and had three hours until 
the conference began.  As the rain began to abate, I decided to leave the rest and 
take a walk along the seafront.  It was still incredibly windy and cold,  but, after 
sitting so long, it felt good to walk around.  I sent a text message home whilst 
sheltering from the wind at a tramstop, then, very windswept, I returned to the 
hotel, to find that we had been allocated our key-cards and could take our luggage 
upstairs.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The rooms were very good, with en-suite and a sea view.  I was sharing with a 
fellow manager from my area, who I get on with very well, so, we unpacked and 
chatted whilst making more coffee, and getting tidy from the wind.  The TV was 
showing a screensaver of an aquarium, so we gathered this was no ordinary TV.  
On investigation, we were correct.  You could do all kinds of things, including 
playing a Playstation game, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails, as well as 
watching your bill escalate!  We were interrupted by my mobile phone.  My 
assistant manager was calling for advice as we had just had the newest member of 
staff phone to quit.  I could only recommend that she phone around to see if 
anyone was available at short notice to cover as I was not returning!  A few minutes 
later, we had returned to the reception area, which was now packed with arriving 
delegates, found the rest of our party, and prepared for the first meeting of the 
conference.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">These conferences are very informative, covering many subjects, from the current 
financial status of the company, it's objectives and successes and failures, and a 
chance to meet and question the directors.  Great fun can be had, and this year's 
proved no exception.  The afternoon's section of the conference started with a 
video of previous year's antics, always good for a laugh and a chance to "spot-the-
idiot", including yourself, followed by the introduction by the managing director, 
marketing director and such like, making their speeches.  These are never dry and 
boring, but fun.  The whole event is entertaining building on the "family" feeling 
between all members.  It is wonderfully presented and rarely boring, but can get 
tiring, especially after a long journey, so the first day is restricted to two or three 
hours.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We had a meal in the hotel restaurant at our leisure and then the evening was ours 
to do as we pleased.  A disco was running in one suite which we could attend if we 
wished, we had free use of the leisure facilities and pool, or we could take the pick 
of three hotel bars to drink, chat and mingle.  Last year's hotel was very expensive 
to drink in, and this looked like it was no different, so we all opted to trying local 
pubs in Blackpool, for a slightly less expensive time.  Some decided to take a taxi, 
instead of walking as it was so cold and windy, but we decided that we should take 
a tram, and even persuaded our Area Manager to join us!  Most of the party had 
not had a chance to ride a tram, so this was a good way to start the evening, and 
the tramstop was nearby.  We all piled in and went as far as the pier, having asked 
the conductor to recommend some places.  On his recommendation, Brannigan's 
was first.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On entering, it became clear that this was not what some members had had in 
mind!  It was rough, dark, running a loud disco, and, promising a "live, local 
band".  The Area Manager's eyebrows reached his hairline, and he started wearing 
a "sucking-a-lemon" type of expression, until he found out the prices at the bar - 
£1.50 per drink, all following drinks £1.  Suddenly, it all didn't seem quite so bad!
By the time we rolled on to the next pub, we had already all had more than 
several drinks, but we were ready for more.  The Area Manger's eyebrows had 
reached his collar by this time.   After pub number three, we headed back toward 
the hotel, some of us stopping a tram, the slower ones having to make do with a 
taxi!  Transport seemed easier than walking.  We were loud - sorry Blackpool - even 
breaking out into song (The wheels on the bus???!!).  I think the locals were glad to 
see us go into the hotel, with one passenger heard to remark "I've lived here most 
of my life, and I never knew these things were buses!"  Blackpool was not ready for 
us!  Most of us were not ready to sleep, so we sought out the disco, and continued 
to socialise for several hours, by which time, the Area Manager's eye-brows had 
retreated back to their normal position, but then, he was as well-oiled as we were!
I retired to sleep around 3am.  Big Mistake!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">By morning I woke feeling the effects of lack of sleep.  It took some doing to un-
nail myself from the mattress.  By the time I had crawled downstairs, it was too late 
for breakfast, but I didn't feel like anything to eat, anyway.  We were ushered 
immediately into the conference room to begin the longest session.  This featured 
the company facts and figures from the previous year, and can be the least 
entertaining part of the whole conference.  This year proved to be no different, and 
trying to stay awake was very difficult, especially as the room got warmer.  As it 
was still wet and windy outside, we were not missing much of Blackpool.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Lunch was followed by a "<B>team building</B>" exercise - usually termed The Challenges.  
This is where I almost ran someone over last year, in a hand-operated go-cart.  
With the inclement weather expected, the Challenges were in different locations 
around the hotel.  First we had to think of a team name which reflected our area, 
design a logo, and print the plain white polo shirts we had been provided with the 
logo.  Points are awarded and the team with the highest number wins.  Then, we 
were given a Challenge to create and operate, awarding points, decide who will 
operate the challenge and the remainder of the team challenge other teams to beat 
their own challenges.  Extra points can be obtained by cheating, conniving or 
otherwise behaving in a devious way!  Some of the challenges were very difficult - 
for a laugh, try some of these<FONT COLOR=WHITE>:-</font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">1. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> <I>Find an open space, with no supports in reach.  Stand on one leg, with the 
other bent at a right angle behind you for what you think is 4 minutes.  Difficult?  
Bet you didn't make 4 minutes.  The best member of our team missed by it by 20 
seconds!</I></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=WHITE>2. <FONT COLOR=SILVER> <I>Form a chain with your team around a pool with a bucket at each end.  One 
bucket is empty, the other full of water.  Transfer the water up the chain and into 
the empty bucket using a beaker with a hole in it in 4 minutes!  The fuller the 
empty bucket, the more points you score.  </I></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR=WHITE>3.  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><I>The most hilarious was for a team of four members.  First the four members 
pass a balloon between their knees, using only their knees, up the chain, with the 
final member dropping it into a bucket using their knees only.  Drop it before then, 
and you re-start from the beginning.  Then the same four members pass a ball 
from spoon to spoon held at chest level up the chain with the final member tossing 
it into a bucket three feet away.  Drop the ball or miss the bucket, and you start 
again.  Finish that, and one member holds a coin between their bum cheeks, walks 
8 feet and then attempts to drop the coin into a glass on the floor.  Team members 
can guide the coin holder and assist in the aim but not touch the glass or coin.  All 
in 4 minutes.  Absolutely impossible, but incredibly funny!</I></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">Finding each challenge was also part of the whole afternoon - there were 16 teams, 
we managed to find 11 of them before the time was up.  Not easy when you're as 
tired and un-energetic as I was.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our team didn't loose - but didn't win either, unlike last year, when we scored the 
least points.  There's no points given for running over team members!  Challenges 
last year ranged from playing volley ball on a bouncy castle (<I>try it - it's mad</I>), a 
slalom course using a buggy controlled by two levers only - forward to go forward, 
back to ....er....reverse, each lever working independently to control the wheels.  
Braking involves letting go of each lever (<I>this is the bit I forgot!</I>). Also clay pigeon 
shooting and team relay go-cart racing on an off-road track (<I>that hurt lots!</I>), to 
name just a few. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Five o'clock came too slowly, but finally, a well earned rest before the Gala dinner 
with pre-dinner drinks at 7.30.  Time for a few hours sleep first, then a quick 
shower, and change into glad rags, and we're off socialising again.  Hard work, 
these conferences! </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was no difficulty in finding where the pre-dinner drinks were.  Find the 
largest queue and join it.  Several companies had donated drinks and free shots of 
a new line of alcho-pops were being given out.  These were all vodka based, 
unfortunately for me, as I'm allergic to vodka, so I had to make do with the wine.  
The rest assure me they tasted wonderful, and I'm not arguing.  The wine was 
excellent too.  We dressed up in silly costumes last year, but this year, we had 
voted not to do it again, so I was surprised to see two girls dressed as the 
Absolutely Fabulous pair circulating amongst us.  A while later, they were passing 
around trays of hors d'euvres, which, on closer inspection, were a piece of cheese, a 
jelly baby, and a hula-hoop on a cocktail stick!  Yuk!  Yes, you've guessed - they 
were the entertainment for the evening.  Some of their stunts were quite ridiculous, 
and included pinning a male victim to his seat, usually by one sitting on him, whilst 
the other applied tape to his leg which was ripped off, plucking his leg hairs in the 
process.  Then they would find a receding head of hair and apply the tape to 
transfer the hair residue!  I can imagine some incredulous looks from the men's 
wives the following day!  "Honest dear, I didn't know what they were going to do!  
Perhaps I could shave the other one to match?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The dinner was superb as usual.  We all entered into a raffle, with proceeds going 
to charity, and one of our team won the first prize.  He had the pick of many prizes 
but chose what he thought was a video player.  He didn't need one, but figured he 
could always sell it later, until he discovered in brighter light that he had, in fact, 
chosen a DVD player and was over the moon.  Another team member won a set of 
saucepans, which was unlucky, as they can't cook!  Some people decline prizes, 
which are then auctioned off, the proceeds going to charity again.  All prizes are 
donated by confectionery, pop and brewery manufacturers, so many wild and 
wacky things are amongst them, including a 6 foot high monkey and a dog the size 
of a single bed!  Imagine trying to get that home on a train!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One of our team had a birthday the following day, and at midnight, being well 
lubricated by the evil drink, we decided to celebrate.  We sneaked around and 
found a small cake, decorated it with a left over candle from the dinner table, 
added a few balloons, some party poppers and a shower cap (which was all we 
could find as a party hat!), and presented it all to the birthday girl, singing "Happy 
Birthday" very badly, which swelled in volume as others joined in.  Not wishing to 
over-do it for the next day, I called it a night at 1.30, and retired to sleep, leaving 
the others heading for a dance-until-you-drop session. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following morning found me wide -eyed and ready to go, fully refreshed, 
unlike other members of the team.  It was their turn to feel as I had, the day 
before, but with hang-overs as well.  Their breakfast was black coffee and 
paracetamol, whilst I made for the restaurant, and a hearty breakfast.  It was there I 
found haggis on offer.  There has been plenty of discussions regarding haggis on 
the Crypt mailing list of late, and I am ashamed to say I had never tried it.  Here 
was a perfect opportunity to try and not have to explain if it was not to my taste.  I 
have to give it top marks - and I will certainly eat haggis again.  It was also 
wonderful to watch the expressions of other team members when I mentioned the 
haggis - that coffee and paracetamol didn't help much!  Don't know what they're 
missing.  After much persuading we were ushered into the conference room again 
for the final session, which included awards for top performing stores, an overview 
of all we had covered the day before, the results of the Challenges, ending with a 
"You've been framed" style of out-takes from the video presentations, which were 
unbelievably funny!  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After that, we were to collect our lunch for the return journey, our luggage, and 
other important hand-outs to take back to the stores, including as many free bottles 
of the new alcho-pop as we felt we could carry.  I managed five, to be distributed 
among my supervisors, who had held the fort whilst I was away, under exceptional 
circumstances.  Many were destined never to reach home, meeting the floor 
unexpectedly in strange places.  After a brief exchange between ourselves and 
directors, we were free to leave.  Two taxis were called to take us back to the 
station, where we waited for our train to take us home.  At Blackpool station, you 
are not allowed onto the platform until the train arrives, which gave us an 
uncomfortable and cramped wait, as we were a little too early.   Finally, the train 
arrived and we decided to claim our reserved seats to prevent having to swop 
about during the journey.  As we set off, we were informed that the train would be 
stopping at some stations along the line through to London Euston, including the 
town where I live.  We were all supposed to change at Crewe, then connect to the 
Birmingham New Street train, changing again to catch specific trains home.  We 
couldn't see the point in my having to go through all that, if this train would take 
me home.  On checking with the ticket inspector, he agreed that I should stay on 
board, whilst the others disembarked, and there would be no extra charge.  To 
whomever you are - thanks - I would have been home a lot later by having to 
travel by three trains.  I had the whole carriage to myself for an hour - unashamed 
luxury!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, this was a new Virgin train, which have doors which are locked from 
the cab, 30 seconds before the train starts to move.  We had seen one poor girl 
racing to catch the train we were on at Preston, having just missed the locking of 
the doors.  Despite arguing with the platform staff, she couldn't get on, as the 
doors have no over-ride and cannot be opened until the next stop.  Aware of this, 
as I approach my home station, I get ready in plenty of time, but I receive a text 
message on my mobile from home, enquiring when I will be expected.  As we have 
stopped at a signal, I phone home to say I was just approaching the station, and 
would phone when I had disembarked.  The train had started moving again during 
the conversation, so I headed up towards the door, stopping to pick up my luggage 
from the luggage stow.  Fate conspired, and the strap on my bag got caught on 
something, which left me tugging for a minute or so.  Finally freeing the bag, I 
made my way to the door - to find it closed.  </P>

<FONT COLOR=LIME>"Can you open the door?"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> I asked the man standing on the platform. <BR> 
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Not now, I've just given the signal to go~<BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIME>"What?  But I want to get off"<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Sorry, Mrs.  The doors cannot be over-riden.  Get off at the next station, and catch 
a train back"<BR>
<FONT COLOR=LIME>"Where's that?"<BR>
<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"Milton Keynes"<BR>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="LEFT">A despairing sigh from me and a return trip to my seat later, I phone home to 
inform them that I may be a little delayed and relate my tale of woe.  After many 
chuckles,  I leave them awaiting my next call to inform them of my progress.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At Milton Keynes, I am waiting by the door before the train has reached the 
platform!  I've no intention of going to London.  I grab the first railway employee I 
spot and ask for the time of the next return train.  Poor chap.  He's ever so helpful 
though, finding me the timetable, assisting me to the right platform and even came 
to check I had been able to get on board.  I phoned home to give an update on 
my plight.  This train was packed, and stopped at all stations in between Milton 
Keynes and home.  Standing room only again.  It seemed hours before I reached 
my home station again, but I was so pleased, I didn't care.  Finally, I set foot on 
the correct platform and made my weary way out to find a taxi to take me home.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Usually there are line of taxis waiting on the rank, but at this time, there 
were.........none.  Phone home again, to inform them I am further delayed due to 
lack of taxis.  The other half chuckled and said that I was to wait and he would 
come and pick me up - just to make absolutely certain I got home.  I pass the store 
as I return home, and resist the urge to visit.  It could wait until tomorrow. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Never have I been so pleased to get home.  The conference had been a strange 
mixture, this year.  Fun, exhausting, frustrating, but with a touch of luxury thrown 
in.  But.........will I go again?  You bet!  Wonder where we're going next year?</P>
