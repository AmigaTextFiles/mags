"Excuse me, Sir."<br>
<p>
"Is that you again, Moses?"<br>
<p>
"I'm afraid it is, Sir."<br>
<p>
"What is it this time, Moses; more computer problems?"<br>
<p>
"How did you guess?"<br>
<p>
"I don't have to guess, Moses. Remember?"<br>
<p>
"Oh, yes; I forgot."<br>
<p>
"Tell me what you want, Moses."<br>
<p>
"But you already know; remember?"<br>
<p>
"Moses!"<br>
<p>
"Sorry, Sir."<br>
<p>
"Well, go ahead, Moses; spit it out."<br>
<p>
"Well, I have a question, Sir. You know those 'ten things' you sent me?"<br>
<p>
"You mean the Ten Commandments, Moses?"<br>
<p>
"That's it. I was wondering if they were important."<br>
<p>
"What do you mean 'were important', Moses?  Of course, they are<br>
important. Otherwise, I would not have sent them to you."<br>
<p>
"Well - sorry, Sir, but I lost them. I could say the dog ate them;<br>
but, of course, you would see right through that."<br>
<p>
"What do you mean 'you lost them'? Are you trying to tell me<br>
you didn't save them, Moses?"<br>

"No, Sir; I forgot."<br>
<p>
"You should always save, Moses."<br>
<p>
"Yes, I know. You told me that before. I was going to, but I forgot.<br>
I did send them to some people before I lost them though."<br>
<p>
"And did you hear back from any of them?"<br>
<p>
"You already know I did. What about the one guy who said he never<br>
uses 'shalt not'?  May he change the words a little bit?"<br>
<p>
"Yes, Moses, as long as he does not change the meaning."<br>
<p>
"And what about the guy who thought your stance was a little harsh,<br>
and recommended calling them the 'Ten Suggestions,' or letting<br>
people pick one or two to try for a while?"<br>
<p>
"Moses, I will act like I did not hear that."<br>
<p>
"I think that means 'no.' Well, what about the guy who said<br>
I was scamming him?"<br>
<p>
"I think the term is 'spamming,' Moses."<br>
<p>
"Oh, yes. I e-mailed him back and told him I don't even eat that stuff,<br>
and I have no idea how you can send it to someone through a computer."<br>
<p>
"And what did he say?"<br>
<p>
"You know what he said. He used Your name in vain. You don't think he<br>
might have sent me one of those - er - plagues, and that's the reason<br>
I lost those ten things, do you?"<br>
<p>
"They are called 'viruses,' Moses."<br>
<p>
"Whatever! This computer stuff is just too much for me. Can we just go<br>
back to those stone tablets?  It was hard on my back taking them out<br>
and reading them each day, but at least I never lost them."<br>
<p>
"We will do it the new way, Moses."<br>
<p>
"I was afraid you would say that, Sir."<br>
<p>
"Moses, what did I tell you to do if you messed up?"<br>

"You told me to hold up this rat and stretch it out toward the computer."<br>
<p>
"It's a mouse, Moses. Mouse! Mouse! And did you do that?"<br>
<p>
"No, I decided to try the technical support first. After all, who knows<br>
more about this stuff than you, and I really like your hours. By the way,<br>
Sir, did Noah have two of these mice on the ark?"<br>
<p>
"No, Moses."<br>
<p>
"One other thing. Why did you not name them 'frogs' instead of 'mice,'<br>
because did you not tell me the thing they sit on is a pad?"<br>
<p>
"I did not name them, Moses. Man did, and you can call yours<br>
a frog if you want to."<br>
<p>
"Oh, that explains it. Kind of like Adam, huh, Sir? I bet some woman<br>
told him to call it a mouse. After all, was it not a woman who named<br>
one of the computers Apple?"<br>
<p>
"Say good night, Moses."<br>
<p>
"Wait a minute, Sir. I am stretching out the mouse, and it seems to<br>
be working. Yes, a couple of the 'ten things' have come back."<br>
<p>
"Which ones are they, Moses?"<br>
<p>
"Let me see. 'Thou shalt not steal from any grave an image'<br>
and 'Thou shalt not uncover thy neighbor's wife.'"<br>
<p>
"Turn the computer off, Moses.<br>
I'm sending you another set of stone tablets."<br>
