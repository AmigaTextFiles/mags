 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Q :</B> Why did I make this program ?</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>A : </B>I don't like to have thousands of post-it notes all over my room...
     This program will replace all those notes, and you don't need to find a
     pen etc.. just use your keyboard ;-)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> This version has a limit to 10kb of data, which I think is way to much
 for such things (but if you think this is to low, please let me know).</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you start the program for the first time, the window content
 says "- Welcome to QuickNote 1.3!". This is the because there is no
 default message available.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The default message is created when the information in the window
 has been changed and the program closed.</P>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">This message will be placed in the same drawer as QuickNote itself,
 and will be called "QuickNote.msg".</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When the program has created the default message and you start the
 program (again) the message will be loaded and visable as the window
 content. From here you can edit your note again, and that's the
 main purpose of this program.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">When you exits the program, the window content and position will be
 remebered until next time you start the program.</P>

 <B> Clear all</B> (Project)<BR>
     Clear the current window content.<BR>
<BR>
 <B> Load default</B> (Project)<BR>
     This clears the current window content and replace it with the default
     message if the message has been changed (A requester will ask you
     if you really want to replace the current text...)<BR>
<BR>
 <B> Save as... </B>(Project)<BR>
     This is an option to let you save the content to a separate file.
     By using this you can use QuickNote as a simple texteditor :-)<BR>
<BR>
 <B> About...</B> (Project)<BR>
     Well, I think all of you understand this one ? :)<BR>
<BR>
 <B> Quit</B> (Project)<BR>
     If you have used the option "Save as..." before you choose this you will
     be asked if you want to save the current text, or just ignore it
     (if you just used the program as a texteditor and don't want to replace
     the default message).<BR>
     This requester will not be showed if you have (after you picked "Save as")
     choosed "Clear all" or "Load default".<BR>
<BR>
 <B> Undo</B> (Edit)<BR>
     Will undo the current content in the delete-buffer.<BR>
<BR>
 <B> Cut</B> (Edit)<BR>
     Cuts the marked text and places it in the clipboard.<BR>
<BR>
