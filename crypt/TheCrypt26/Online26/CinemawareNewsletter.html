<P ALIGN="LEFT">The GameSpot review sums it up best: Anyone who has played Defender of the Crown on the Commodore 64, Amiga, or NES will quickly fall in love with
the GBA version.  I couldnt have said it better myself!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you still havent gotten a Game Boy Advance, <B>well</B>, what more do we have to do?!  Make an all-new version of Wings just for the system?  Oh yeah,
were doing that too!  So just whats up with our wee WWI game?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm happy to report that development for Wings GBA is finished and we sent the game off for approval from Nintendo last week.  Raylight and Crawfish
have really been burning the midnight oil packing in dramatic dogfights, gorgeous graphics, multiplayer madness and a stunning storyline.  (<I>Ok, enough
alliteration Phew!</I>)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We dont have a set ship date for the game yet, but never fear!  Well be sure to let all our fans know as soon as the game is ready to go.  In the
meantime, you can check out all the details and oodles of screens over at:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As usual, our internal team is plugging away, hard at work on our flagship game, Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown.  Were coming up on Alpha pretty
soon, which means a lot of the hardest work is behind us.  For all you non-technical types (<I>myself included</I>), Alpha means that everything thats going
to be in the game is there in some form.  It might be a little rough around the edges  but weve got the groundwork laid for an amazing game!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you missed it back in August, we posted the first ever high-resolution screenshots from the game, and boy, do they look great!   But, since then,
the game looks even better  I should really go get some new screens. In fact, Im going to go grab some right now!  I think its up to Amber Hood to
liberate some valuable screens and redistribute them to our needy fans!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hey, and speaking of Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown (<I>and I do that a lot in these newsletters, I know</I>!), GameSpot also posted a second interview
with a few of the team members.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">GameSpot did an interview with a few of the team last year, and Ryan MacDonald was kind enough to invite us back for another video interview now that
the game is further along.  Its got a ton of juicy tidbits on the game, as well as a bunch of game footage, so be sure to check it out.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For those of you waiting patiently for the next round of Digital Remasters  dont despair!  Wings and Lords of the Rising Sun are still on the way! 
It turned out that the tricky process of reverse engineering the original Amiga code was a little bit trickier than we first planned, but the wizards
over at Clickboom have finally made it over the hump and were making a ton of progress now.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We've got a few new screens of both games up for your viewing pleasure. I think youll all agree that these ones are going to be worth the wait! </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Take a look at Wings page at: <A HREF="http://www.cinemaware.com/wingsremaster_main.asp">http://www.cinemaware.com/wingsremaster_main.asp</A> and Lord of the Rising Sun at:
<A HREF="http://www.cinemaware.com/lordsremaster_main.asp.">http://www.cinemaware.com/lordsremaster_main.asp.</A></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you signed up to be in the running for one of the Beta Test slots for these games you probably havent heard from us yet.  But you will!  Well be
picking a few lucky candidates in the next few weeks to help us make these games the best they can be.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If youre familiar with the original Amiga versions of these games and can commit to a few hours a week over the next few months, fill out the
application at <A HREF="http://www.cinemaware.com/betaapplication.asp.">http://www.cinemaware.com/betaapplication.asp.</A>  If you already filled out the application, give it another go so we know youre still
available.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As before, we cant offer much in exchange, but your name will be featured in the game credits and every tester will receive a free copy of the final
game! Theres a limited amount of Beta seats available, so reply soon! (Beta testing is limited to residents of the USA)
