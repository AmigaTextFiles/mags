<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
It exists many other tools allowing various text conversions, but some give no interface or disappointing results or no option.<BR>
<BR>
This program isn't perfect but it should give you a great help.<BR>
<BR>
These are some adjectives describing WoW :<BR>
<UL>

<LI><B>Easy</B> : the WoW archive contains the minimum amount of files (exe +
short doc)<BR>
<LI><B>Powerful</B> : WoW provides you standard conversions but others really
new<BR>
<LI><B>Cheap</B> : WoW is offered for free in a full version for a legal usage
for all<BR>
<LI><B>Evoluting</B> : WoW is in permanent development and comments and ideas are
really welcome<BR>
<LI><B>Practical</B> : WoW provides an easy interface using MUI or a call with a
command line<BR>
<LI><B>Free</B> : WoW may be distributed without any restrictions, you don't

<BR>
<CENTER>(Between brackets, the actual state of the conversion in the date of 07/08/00 - v1.10)</CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><B>Ascii -> Ascii</B> : This standard is not a real one, it's necessary to
manage the different implementations<BR>
<LI><B>AmigaGuide -> Ascii</B> : may be useful<BR>
<LI><B>Html -> Ascii</B> : To keep only the essential from a web page<BR>
<LI><B>Pdb -> Ascii</B> : PalmPilot becomes really current, as Web articles in its PBD format [100%]<BR>
<LI><B>Rtf -> Ascii</B> : If your wordprocessor doesn't support Rtf ... waiting for a better solution  [supports ansi accents]<BR>
<LI><B>Postscript -> Ascii</B> : A PAO document impossible to read ? [not very good but allows to obtain raw text]<BR>
<LI><B>Word -> Ascii</B> : Read a annoying Word text (formats Word 2, 6, ... supported) is no more a problem<BR>
<LI><B>Wordworth -> Ascii</B> : An ASCII text saved too quickly into Wordworth ? [100%]<BR>
<LI><B>Ascii -> HTML</B> : Avoid to add HTML tags manualy over a plain text
[generated code awnsers the W3C standard]<BR>
<LI><B>Wordworth -> Rtf</B> : Will offer a better export than Wordworth 6
itself [for now, only document parameters and text attributes (style, fonts) are supported]<BR>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't you just hate it when someone decides to send you a file in that over inflated "Word Format". Of course you can't read it unless you have a PC ...Or can you ?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Using WoW you can convert "Word" documents into plain readable text, However you will of course lose any Pictures included with the original file.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">WoW is unbelievably fast at Text conversions and should be a MUST on every Amiga Harddrive.</P>
