        <CENTER>The campfire crackled in the crisp night air.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Joe's boots crunched on the frosty grass.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Stars that looked so close you could pluck them</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Mirrored in the alpine lake, smooth as glass.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>He had ridden two days to get here,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Like his father and grandfather, but not quite:</CENTER>
        <CENTER>No bacon sizzled, no egg fried -</CENTER>
        <CENTER>He munched bagels with cream cheese, light.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>It was four in the morning of elk season.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>But that's not why he couldn't sleep.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>He thought of his dad, now departed, </CENTER>
        <CENTER>And a promise he'd come here to keep.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>He'd packed in the can with the ashes,</CENTER>
       <CENTER> Though since winter old Ace had been dead.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>And here where heaven touched the earth,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>The remains of his father were spread.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>Though the sky gave not a clue of dawn,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>An elk bugled loud and shrill.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Joe answered, his skills well taught.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Then he started up the hill.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
        <CENTER>Daybreak found him on the edge of a ridge.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Elk music echoed all around.</CENTER>
       <CENTER> Then thundering up came a massive bull;</CENTER>
        <CENTER>He was there to defend his ground.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>Joe studied the monarch in his sights,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Then he laid his rifle away.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>For he knew this elk, from the scar on his chest,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Shaped just like the running J.</CENTER>
<BR>

        <CENTER>The Running J was his grandpa's ranch.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>An' lest the old man's spirit lived inside,</CENTER>
        <CENTER>It was one his father would never shoot,</CENTER>
       <CENTER> Up where heaven was a two day ride.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>Then a youngster elk with an untrained call</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Bugled a warbling, wavering squeak.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>He trotted up to the hunter's roost.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Joe eyed him and felt awed and weak.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>The button spiked lad, he too had a scar.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>Was like seeing a ghost in the face.</CENTER>
        <CENTER>For as clear as could be was the letter "A",</CENTER>
        <CENTER>For his dad, the one they called Ace.</CENTER>
<BR>
        <CENTER>And he swore he heard his father's voice</CENTER>
        <CENTER>As he studied the mark on the hide,</CENTER>
        <CENTER><B>"Come up whenever you need me, Son.</B></CENTER>
        <CENTER><B>Heaven's only a two day ride."</B></CENTER>
