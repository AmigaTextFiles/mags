<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the concentrated purge on child pornography, the Law has been amended to exclude 
pictures of young children being taken.  This step, though understandable in theory, has 
given rise to a questionable situation when it comes to parents wishing to photograph their 
children during sports and drama events.  A local school has, in effect, banned the taking of 
photographs during these events by parents, leading to upset and dis-harmony.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though we can understand the reasons for this endeavour, maybe the politically correct world 
is finally going a step too far: the effective situation being that if a child whose parents do not 
wish to be photographed comes into the view-finder, you cannot take the shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Period.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This effectively means that parents will have NO permanent record of their children's 
progress throughout their school lives.  We parents and guardians are being punished for the 
crimes of perverts whom the Law sees fit to allow amongst society.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe the time is right 
for a total re-vamp of the judicial system, to lose the mamby-pamby <B>"bleeding hearts and 
artistes"</B> attitude, and get back to a common sense system of <B>Law and Order</B>.  Then, and only 
then, will the streets return to some manner of safety for those that use them, and we'll stop 
living as though we're a part of George Orwell's 1984 !</P>
