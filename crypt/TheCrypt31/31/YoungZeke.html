<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pretty soon, they came to a clump of trees, and she asked him
to stop.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Seeing that he was bashful, she took his face in her hands and
kissed him. Then she asked, "<I><B>Do you want to go a little
farther</B></I>?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He said, "<B>Yep. Giddy up, Betsy.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So they rode a little farther, and she asked him to pull up at
another shady spot. Then she took one of his hands and placed
it inside her bosom and his other hand on her thigh, and asked.
"<I><B>Do you want to go a little farther</B></I>?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Again he said, "<B>Yep. Giddy up, Betsy.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, when they stopped at the third bushy place, she reached
over, opened his fly and took his pecker out. She spread
herself before him and asked, "<I><B>Now, do you want me to put it
in for you</B></I>?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He replied, "<B>Yep. My paw would kill me if I came home with it
hanging out.</B>"</P>
