now  they're  taking  things  one  stage  further  by  fitting  13
essential items into a precision pen!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Constructed  using Aircraft Grade Alloy,  this sleek  bit  of  kit
includes  a  flat screwdriver,  hole puncher,  steel file,   short
cutting  blade,   ear  pick,  nail remover,  long  cutting  blade,
tweezers,  phillips screwdriver,  steel fork,  saw and  a  writing
pen.<B> (Kitchen sink not included)</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">James Bond would be lost without one of these beauties.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  pen un-twists into three cylinders,  each with storage  slots
to  hold the various blades.  The two knurled cylinder joints also
contain  tools on each side.  Made out of a rugged yet lightweight
aluminium  alloy,  the Swiss Military Pen is  great  for  campers,
hunters, do-it-yourselfers, repair people and gadget-levers.</P>
