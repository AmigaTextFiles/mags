<IMG SRC="Images/008heathland.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="260" ALT="heathland.j"><font color=aqua> The North Norfolk Railway offers a 10.5 mile round trip by steam train (vintage diesel trains on some journeys) through a delightful area of North Norfolk designated as being of outstanding natural beauty. To the south are wooded hills and the Norfolk beauty spots of Kelling Heath and Sheringham Park. To the north, the sea. All within easy walking distance from the various stations. The flowers are a sight to see throughout the year. In spring and early summer there are primroses, bluebells and the yellow gorse. Later in the year the poppies abound and are set off by the mauve heathers. Enjoy a ride on an historic steam train - you can break your journey to look around the stations and marvel at the steam laden atmosphere from a bygone age.<p>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> But the North Norfolk Railway is much more than a train ride. There are historic stations, a museum of local railway history, a museum signal box and a visitors centre. There are also buffets and souvenir shops.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Sheringham, the Railway's headquarters, is more than just a station. There is a Visitor's Centre, Museum of Local Railways, a Museum Signal Box and a Souvenir Shop and Buffet. The station is ideally situated for you to take a stroll through the town and walk along the promenade before joining your train.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Weybourne, a delightfully preserved country station and our locomotive and carriage maintenance and restoration centre. Enjoy a cup of tea from the buffet and take advantage of the picnic area to watch the trains come and go. Several walks are available through Weybourne Woods and Sheringham Park, with direct access to the Kelling Nature Trail, or walk down to the sea and take the coastal footpath to Sheringham. Or at week-ends and during the holiday season come and visit the model railway which is located in the parcels van on Platform 3.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Kelling Heath Park is our smallest station serving the Nature Trail and Kelling Caravan Park. Owing to the steep gradient steam trains do not stop here on the journey to Holt but will stop if a clear signal is given to the driver on the return trip from Holt to Sheringham.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Holt  is our western terminus and is just about 1 mile from the centre of this lovely Georgian Town. The "Holt Flyer", a horse drawn bus service meets most steam trains. Whilst on the station be sure to drop in and see 'Broad Sidlinch' a 300 square foot model railway, which was featured in the Railway Modeller in July '99: this is open at weekends and during the 'red' service.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The best way to travel is to purchase a ROVER ticket. These cost £7.50 for adults, £6.50 for senior citizens or £4.00 for a child and entitle you to travel for the whole day. Details of the current fares can be found on our 'fares' page.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Dogs and cycles are welcome on our trains although there is a small additional charge. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Our award winning Gresley buffet provides bar facilities on the train. Norfolk Ales are available on draught together with spirits and canned alcoholic drinks. A wide range of hot and cold drinks are available in addition to sandwiches, light snacks, cakes and confectionary. Sip your freshly made tea as you watch the countryside roll by.</P>

 <CENTER>And, finally, the answer to why we are called the Poppy Line:</CENTER>
