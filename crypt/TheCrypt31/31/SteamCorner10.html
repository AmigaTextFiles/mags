<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, we have looked at steam motive power solely - but the great designers of 
steam were aware of alternative tractive formats.&nbsp; For some, these early and 
sometimes crude machines are remembered with a form of fondness;&nbsp; for others, 
with a sense of revulsion, but like them or not, the diesel and electric locos of 
the 1900's served to shape the railways of the future.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Nigel Gresley, through the successes of his locomotives, developed a design 
for an electric shunting engine.&nbsp; This bore a centrally mounted cab giving good 
visibility in either direction, and a mounting point for a pantograph to collect 
power from overhead lines.&nbsp;  The loco, whilst being practical in bodywork 
design, was less than attractive and the overhead power supply made goods 
handling awkward. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other engineers also had similar visions;&nbsp; O.V. Bullied produced a wide range of 
Electric Multiple Units for the Southern Region.&nbsp; These were primarily for 
London suburban usage, as steam propulsion was a rather time consuming 
affair, with run arounds making rush hour traffic a problem. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experiments were conducted using all manner of power.&nbsp; The most notable of 
these appear to have been the Turbomotive, using a Stanier Coronation as a 
basis, which utilised a steam turbine for propulsion; this introduced the English 
Electric Co. into the equation, who had until then been occupied with marine 
projects.&nbsp; Not only did the E.E. provide for the Turbomotive project, but in time 
went on to produce some early prototype diesels, which gained some 
considerable interest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The early diesels didn't fare well on the reliability side - station pilots were 
employed on a regular basis to remove "dead" engines, and as such, the threat 
to so many livelihoods went unheeded.&nbsp; These new machines were "Alright in 
their own way, but will never replace steam for reliability".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Great Western took delivery of a small batch of German built railcars to put 
on trial on lesser used branches - these proved quite useful, but one design 
fitted with pneumatic tyres produced motion sickness, and were nearly silent 
when running.&nbsp; Trackside teams soon gave them the nick-name of the 
"whispering death", which earnt them no favours whatsoever !</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diesels came in three varieties:&nbsp; diesel/mechanical, diesel/hydraulic, and 
diesel/electric, as designs improved.&nbsp; The ever-familiar diesel railcars and 
shunters were of a diesel/mechanical form, now of a diesel/electrical variety, 
with main-line locos either of electric 
or hydraulic varieties.&nbsp; The hydraulics were peculiar to the Western Region, and 
several have been preserved since, though due to maintenance costs, these were 
the first to be withdrawn.&nbsp; The average BHP output of a main-line loco was at 
this time around 2500 bhp, with one major exception - the Eastern Region 
Deltics, carrying twin derivatives of a German aero-engine, and developing 3300 
bhp.&nbsp; The original Deltic with it's blue and yellow pinstripe is on view at the 
National Railway Museum;&nbsp; it's sisters having changed little from the original in 
design.&nbsp;  The major drawback with the Deltic class was the necessity of ear-
defenders whilst within the loco's confines - the noise of these heavy duty locos 
was quite extraordinary.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the modern railway system seeks to use new, high powered locos, 
there seems to be no shortage of diesels from nearly forty years ago.&nbsp; Type 4 
Brush and English Electric locos still grace the various Railfreight liveries that 
abound on the system, proof in itself that reliability has improved beyond all 
measure from the days of the diesel's infancy!&nbsp; Yet even now, some 40 odd years 
after the demise of main-line steam, a fascination remains.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present day railman, regardless of position, still has a bond with steam 
locos, and a great many take far more than a passing interest in any excursion 
scheduled through their section.&nbsp; Though they might not admit the fact, the great 
engineers of the steam era have forged these men who joined what would 
become a second family - the railways - and changed their perceptions 
irrevocably.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this Steam Corner has been informative;&nbsp; hopefully,&nbsp; I'll be visiting 
another preservation society in the near future, which will form the next article.</P>
