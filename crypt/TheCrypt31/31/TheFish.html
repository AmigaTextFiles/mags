 around and finally stops to watch a fisherman load his boat.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The fisherman notices, and asks the priest if he would like to join him for a
couple of hours. The priest agrees. The fisherman asks if the priest has
ever fished before, to which the priest says no. He baits the hook for him
 and says,"Give it a shot father".</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Priest: "Uh, please sir, can you mind your language?"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Fisherman: (Quick thinking) "I'm sorry father, but that's what this
 fish is called - a f*cker!"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Priest: "Oh, I'm sorry - I didn't know."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">After the trip, the priest brings the fish to the church and spots
the bishop.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Priest: "Look at this big f*cker"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Bishop: "Please, mind your language, this is a house of God."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Priest: "No, you don't understand - that's what this fish is called,
 and I caught it. I caught this f*cker!"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Bishop: "Hmmm. You know, I could clean this f*cker and we could have
it for dinner."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">So the Bishop takes the fish and cleans it, and brings it to the head mother.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Bishop: "Could you cook this f*cker for dinner tonight?"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Head Mother: "My lord, what language!"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Bishop: "No, sister, that's what the fish is called - a f*cker!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Father caught it, I cleaned it, and we'd like you to cook it."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Head Mother: "Hmmm. Yes, I'll cook that f*cker tonight."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, the Pope stops by for dinner with the 3 of them, and they all
 think the fish is great. He asks where they got it.</P>

 lights up a joint, pours himself a large whiskey and says, </P>
