<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were gathered 'round the television, where Little Lady was 
watching an episode of Stuart Little.  The kids had entered the 
mother for a Home Of The Year contest sponsored by some fancy 
magazine, but she had fallen ill just before "The Committee" was 
to visit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turned to my wife with yet another one of my way-too-brilliant 
ideas. &nbsp; "<B>Why don't we enter the Home Of The Year contest?</B>" I 
asked.</P>

<B>My wife looked around in horror.&nbsp;  "<I><B>What</B></I>?&nbsp;  <I><B>With this place</B></I>?"</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Lady, just over two years old, was looking for the green 
crayon.  "<B>Sure,</B>" I replied, obviously missing something.&nbsp;  "<B>Why 
not?  It's a great home.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>This place is a mess,</B></I>" my wife said in frustration, as she 
started slipping the videos back into their sleeves.&nbsp;  "<I><B>What 
magazine would call this home of the year</B></I>?&nbsp;  <I><B>Dump Monthly</B></I>? &nbsp; <I><B>Trash 
Can News</B></I>? &nbsp;&nbsp; <I><B>Oh, I know - Bad Housekeeping</B></I>?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Lady emptied the crayon box on the floor.  "<B>Oh come on,</B>" I 
answered. "<B>This is a wonderful home full of love and joy.  See 
all the drawings taped to the wall?</B>"</P>

"<I><B>In the Home Of The Year, there are no crayon drawings taped to 
the wall,</B></I>" my wife explained with just a hint of patience. <BR> 
"<I><B>There might be an original Rembrandt or Van Gogh, or perhaps an 
exceptional imitation.  It would be placed in an elegant frame.</B></I>"<BR>
<BR>  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Lady found the green crayon.  Now she needed a sheet of 
paper on which to draw. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>I don't know,</B>" I hesitated.  "<B>Rembrandt and Van Gogh don't sound 
very homey. &nbsp; I suspect you might find them in the Museum Of The 
Year contest.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>Just look at this dust</B></I>!" my wife cried. &nbsp; She blew on the top of 
the television set, which temporarily vanished into the haze.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Lady emptied her bookshelf with one fell swoop, but still 
could not find paper on which to draw.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>OK, so it's dusty,</B>" I admitted.  "<B>If we dusted more frequently, 
we would spend less time together and it would be less of a 
home.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>The Home Of The Year contest Committee really does not care 
whether we spend time together,</B></I>" my wife said. &nbsp; She headed toward 
the kitchen in search of iced tea, nearly tripping over a bag of 
clothes along the way. &nbsp;"<I><B>They just want to see a spotless house 
with all the classiest decorations.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who needs paper, anyway.  Little Lady found a blank spot on the 
wall, and started applying her green crayon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Well, that might make a good House Of The Year, but a home is a 
place to live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It needs to exude love and comfort, not 
cleanliness,</B>" I said.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apparently, I was still clueless.  "<I><B>Homes of the year never exude 
love,&nbsp;&nbsp; and certainly not comfort,</B></I>" she explained, picking up a 
copy of Good Housekeeping from the floor.&nbsp;  "<I><B>They are showcases of 
a woman's ability to keep a house in immaculate condition with 
absolute precision ... despite the presence of a male creature 
around.</B>"</I></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Ouch.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Little Lady gleefully switched to the red crayon.  "<B>Well I 
don't know anything about keeping a house tidy, but if that's 
what the magazines want, why don't they call it The Janitorial 
Olympics?</B>" I asked.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>I don't know.&nbsp;  Maybe it's too hard for them to spell,</B></I>" my wife 
replied, smiling. &nbsp; "<B><I>But they don't, so just get used to reality.  
We simply do not have even the slightest, tiniest, most minuscule 
hope of ever winning the Home Of The Year contest.</I></B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By then, Little Lady had drawn three stick figures on the wall.  
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><B>"My home,"</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> she shouted, running to give Mommy a big hug.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=BLUE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I didn't need a magazine to tell me we already lived in the home 
of the year.  And if the dust doesn't kill us off first, we will 
live there every year.</P>
