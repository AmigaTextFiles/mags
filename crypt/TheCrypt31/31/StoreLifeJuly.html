<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The Convenience Store</B> - the corner shop. &nbsp; Everyone's got one, quite local to them, 
usually on the corner of the road.&nbsp;  Always there, always open, except when you run 
out of milk at 2am or the cat's just come in and wants feeding, then they're closed. &nbsp; 
We take them for granted, and then moan when they close down because the new 
supermarket that opened recently that's about 2 miles away, has taken all the 
custom, and they can't afford to compete and stay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's not easy to run a little corner shop - ask anyone who's tried it, and they'll tell 
you all about it.&nbsp;  I know, I manage one. &nbsp; Let me give you an example of a typical 
working day. &nbsp; Do I hear you say&nbsp; "That's boring"? &nbsp; Not likely. &nbsp; <B>Just try this for size.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shop opens from 7am until 10pm at night, every day, seven days a week, all 
year round.&nbsp;  There's no rest for the wicked - just that I'd like the opportunity to be 
wicked once in a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <B>:-)</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I must have been wicked once since someone seems to want revenge at the 
moment.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was just one of those days, sun shining, kids on school holidays, shop nicely 
busy, and we were short staffed, due to holidays, etc. &nbsp; What could go wrong on 
such a pleasant day? &nbsp; My assistant manager and I were taking three hour shifts turn 
and turn about, as we had a cashier on holiday, and I had just started my first shift.  
It was the middle of the morning, the chilled delivery had just arrived and she was 
putting the products on the shelves, and at the same time, the bread man arrived. &nbsp; 
I had no customers to serve, so it was suggested that I take the bread returns, 
already on the bread tray, out to the bread van to save time.&nbsp;  No problem - that's 
been done a thousand times before.&nbsp;  I made my way through the shop with a fully 
laden bread tray and out to the van parked outside the shop.&nbsp;  He normally parks at 
the rear of the shop in the car park to off-load, but sometimes there is no space 
due to cars, so the second choice is the road outside the shop front.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was in the back of the van making up our order, and missed all the action. &nbsp; As 
I made my way to the tail gate of the van, I couldn't see the edge of the path due 
to the width of the bread tray, and fell down it.&nbsp;  The bread went flying onto the 
road, and the bread tray landed on top of me up side down.&nbsp;  I just sat and 
laughed - until I tried to stand up, that is. &nbsp; I must somehow have landed on my left 
foot as I fell and the pain was excruciating. &nbsp; I'm trying not to re-cycle my breakfast 
as I stand up, and pick up the bread from the floor onto the bread tray again.&nbsp;  It 
was easier to pick up the tray, slide that onto the van floor, then pick up the bread.&nbsp;  
The bread man, having missed it all, couldn't understand why I was trying to give 
him an empty tray and kept pushing it off the back as I'm bending down picking 
up the bread from the road.&nbsp;  Thankfully, a couple of regular customers came to my 
assistance, explaining the events on my behalf as I hobbled back inside. &nbsp; A queue 
had developed, so I quickly went to serve.&nbsp;  I thought they would never go. &nbsp; All the 
time, my foot was throbbing and swelling up. &nbsp; After ten minutes, the shop is empty 
once more, and I can grab a bag of frozen peas to slap on my aching foot.&nbsp;  By 
then, of course, the bread man has returned with the order, and enlightened my 
assistant manager to my plight.&nbsp;  On further investigation, we decide that a trip to 
the hospital might not be a bad idea, just in case anything is broken, as I can't 
move my toes.&nbsp;  A further member of staff is summoned in on her day off to take 
over and help with the main delivery which is on it's way to the store.&nbsp;  A taxi is 
called and I am whisked off to casualty.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After an X-ray and examination, it's decided that my foot has suffered nothing 
more serious than severe bruising.&nbsp;  "<B>Take pain killers and it'll be fine in a day or 
so.</B>"&nbsp;  Back to work I go.&nbsp;  I arrive just as the main delivery is being off loaded. &nbsp; 
Now it's some-one else's turn.&nbsp;  At his first store, the lorry driver had just wheeled in 
the first two trolleys and was returning for some more, when he noticed movement 
in the back of his lorry. &nbsp; Knowing that he had no "live" cargo, he went to 
investigate.&nbsp;  He was confronted with a person with a knife, who was passing bags 
of cigarettes to another person.&nbsp;  He was threatened with the knife before they 
jumped into a car and sped off.&nbsp;  Taking the vehicle's registration number, he 
phoned the police, who arrived very quickly, but the car turned out to be stolen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After an hour and a half of questioning, he was allowed to continue, but every 
store he visited had had their cigarettes missing from their order.&nbsp;  Ours was no 
exception, although we did have some left. &nbsp; Not many, and certainly not enough to 
last over the weekend. &nbsp; After much arguing with the warehouse, it was decided 
they would send the missing packs the next day. </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Two of us not having the most brilliant day - what else could go wrong? </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After taking in the delivery, I decide I would be of more use serving than putting 
out the delivery, and allowing the other fitter girls to attend to stocking the shelves.&nbsp;  
The following day, my foot had turned black and blue, and although very painful, 
it did not stop me working. &nbsp; Over the week, my left foot turned many different 
colours, but eventually the swelling went down and it became less painful.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next week, I dropped a box of toffee bars from the trolley. &nbsp; I caught it on my 
knee, and never gave it a second thought until I climbed into bed that night.&nbsp;  
There on my left knee was the biggest bruise covering my kneecap.&nbsp;  It caused 
much concern to my other half, who came to bed much later after returning home 
late, and who did not know the story.&nbsp;  I woke to find him trying to find other 
marks consistent with an accident!&nbsp;  He was relieved, although still concerned when I 
enlightened him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just to cap it all, just as those bruises were reducing, I moved a box in the 
warehouse, only to have a bag of beer cans fall.&nbsp;  Thinking they were empty ones 
being saved for a display, I made no effort to avoid them, and was unpleasantly 
surprised to find them full and landing heavily on my left foot - again.&nbsp;  <B>More 
bruises.</B>&nbsp;  You need a full suit of armour in this job for safety!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally,&nbsp; I'll leave you with a true tale which proves it can only happen to us.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A note appeared on my desk this morning, informing me that I may like to view 
the previous night's CCTV video around 9.30 pm as they had encountered "some 
weird men" near closing time.&nbsp;  Due to this, they had closed early for their safety. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Curious,&nbsp; I did just that.&nbsp;  The store had been busy, as it usually is in the last half 
hour before closing. &nbsp; The cashier was enjoying a joke with two regular customers, 
and the supervisor was undertaking the shut down routine - newspaper returns, 
store and shelf tidying and such like, when several people entered the store.&nbsp;  Two 
of them were known addicts looking for items to thieve and were to be followed 
around before being evicted.&nbsp;  Two were regular customers coming to buy beer, 
pop, crisps and cigarettes for the rest of the night, and two were unknown to 
anyone. &nbsp; They were acting a little strangely, so the supervisor went to offer 
assistance, while she's chasing the addicts around the store, to find one of the 
"strange" men dropping his trousers! &nbsp; Too intent on evicting the addicts, she had 
little time to react until she'd locked the addicts out of the shop. &nbsp; By this time, the 
man had pulled up his trousers and the two men became very agitated about being 
locked in the shop, paid for their goods and left, only to sit and wait outside in 
their car for some time.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The note to me was hurriedly written and they finished the close down procedure.&nbsp;  
When they were convinced the car had gone, they were able to lock up and leave 
for home.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On watching the video footage, I became concerned and phoned the police. &nbsp; 
Explaining the events was not easy and the conversation went as follows:</P>

<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "I wish to report a strange incident which happened last night in my store"<BR>
<B>Police:</B>&nbsp;  "<I>How strange?</I>"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "Two men came in and one dropped his trousers. &nbsp; I have video evidence"<BR>
<B>Police:</B>&nbsp; "<I>Pardon</I>? &nbsp; <I>He dropped his trousers</I>?&nbsp;  <I>Why should he do that</I>?"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "I have no idea. &nbsp; It shocked the staff on duty at the time, and when the men  
left, they waited for some time outside in their car.&nbsp;  The staff had to wait until they 
had gone before they could go home."<BR>
<B>Police :</B>&nbsp; "<I>It would have been useful if you could have phoned last night</I>"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "Probably, but I only heard about it this morning.&nbsp;  Mr X and his friend were 
also in having a 'free shop' at the time."<BR>
<B>Police :</B>&nbsp; "<I>I can get an officer to view the video.</I>&nbsp;  <I>Where did you say you were</I>?&nbsp;  
<I>Where did it happen</I>?"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "In the shop. &nbsp; By the crisp dump bin"<BR>
<BR>
By now the woman on the phone is trying to suppress laughter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Police :</B>&nbsp; "<I>I see</I>.&nbsp; <I>Will the supervisor be able to identify the man who dropped his 
trousers</I>?"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "Before or after the incident?" <BR> 
<BR>
By this time, two fellow workers with me are in hysterics, muttering things about 
"mooning" and further derogatory remarks regarding such behaviour.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Police (after much giggling) : </B>&nbsp;"<I>I think I'll re-phrase that.</I>*nbsp;  <I>Could she describe both 
men at the time they entered the shop</I>?"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "She will probably be able to.&nbsp;  She'll be at work tomorrow morning."<BR>
<BR>
Now I'm trying to smother a laugh as one of the others sings "<B>I saw the crevice, 
but she saw the whole of the moon</B>"!!!!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Police :</B>&nbsp; "<I>Good</I>.&nbsp;  <I>What's her name</I>?"<BR>
<B>Me (in between howls of laughter):</B>&nbsp; "Ramsbottom.&nbsp;  No.&nbsp;  Honestly - that's her name!&nbsp;
This is a farce - it can only be happening here" <BR>
<BR> 
Further mutterings of "Farce?  No, it was an ARSE" coming from the other staff.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Police :</B>&nbsp; "We'll try to get an officer there in the morning.&nbsp;  Is there any other time 
she will be available?"<BR>
<B>Me :</B>&nbsp; "Erm - no.&nbsp;  Tomorrow's her last day for 6 months.&nbsp;  She's pregnant and is on  
maternity leave."<BR>
<BR>
More howls of laughter, both on the phone and from the other two.&nbsp;  Further 
mutterings of "He only dropped his trousers - now see what he's done."&nbsp; and &nbsp;  
"That's quick work"<BR>
<BR>
I had to end the conversation before it developed any further and it became 
impossible to speak for laughing.<BR>
<BR>
I'll see how we get on with the visit from the boys in blue tomorrow. &nbsp; We'll have 
to see how seriously they take it!&nbsp;  I should image this video will be copied many 
times for police entertainment. <BR>
