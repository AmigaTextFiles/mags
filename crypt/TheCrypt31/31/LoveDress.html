<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A woman stopped by unannounced at her recently married
son's house. She rang the doorbell and walked in. She was shocked
to see her daughter-in-law lying on the couch, totally naked. Soft
music was playing, and the aroma of perfume filled the room.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>What are you doing</B></I>?" she asked. <B>"I'm waiting for my husband to come
home from work,"</B> the daughter-in-law answered.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>But you're naked!</B></I>" the mother-in-law exclaimed.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"This is my love dress,"</B> the daughter-in-law explained.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Love dress? But you're naked!</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>"My husband loves me to wear this dress,"</B> she explained. <B>"It excites
him no end. Everytime he sees me in this dress,he instantly becomes
romantic and ravages me for hours on end. He can't get enough of me."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mother-in-law left. When she got home, she undressed, showered,
put on her best perfume, dimmed the lights, put on a romantic CD, and
laid on the couch waiting for her husband to arrive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, her husband came home.</P>
