<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A married couple went to the hospital to have their baby delivered.
Upon their arrival, the doctor said that the hospital was testing an 
amazing new high-tech machine that would transfer a portion of the 
mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He asked if they were 
willing to try it out. Both said they were very much in favor of it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctor set the pain transfer to 10 per cent for starters, 
explaining that even 10 percent was probably more pain than the father 
had ever experienced before.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the 
doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch.
The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20 per cent pain transfer. The 
husband was still feeling fine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctor then checked the husband's Blood pressure and was amazed at 
how well he was doing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point they decided to try for 50 per cent. The husband 
continued to feel quite well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the pain transfer was obviously helping the wife considerably, 
the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him.
The wife delivered a healthily baby with virtually no pain, and the 
husband had experienced none.</P>
