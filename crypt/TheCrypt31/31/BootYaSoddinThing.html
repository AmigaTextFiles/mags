<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  can  be  a  heart-wrenching experience.&nbsp;  You push  that  power
button,&nbsp;   and all hell breaks loose.  Beeps,  error messages, &nbsp;   red
X's,   BSOD's (Blue Screen of Death)  are everywhere. &nbsp;   Or, &nbsp; &nbsp;   even
worse, nothing at all. Deadly silence.&nbsp;  <B>What's going on?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first rule is to stay calm.&nbsp;  Panicking,&nbsp;  yelling,&nbsp;  cursing and
throwing things won't help - though it might make you feel  better
for  a  second. &nbsp; But to troubleshoot and resolve the  problem, &nbsp;  a
clear  head is imperative.&nbsp;  Be systematic and approach the problem
logically.&nbsp;  The troubleshooting steps below will take a methodical
approach  to  help  you  figure out why your  PC  is  not  booting
correctly  or not booting at all. &nbsp; Some of the steps  might  sound
silly  to you,  <B>but please don't ignore those steps!</B>  Every single
problem  and solution in this article has happened to somebody  at
some  point.&nbsp;  Most of them it takes only a few seconds  to  check,
take the time to do so.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Nothing happens at all</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Start  with  the power. &nbsp; Is the power cable plugged  in  correctly
into a UPS,  surge protector,  power strip, or wall outlet?&nbsp;  Is the
wall  outlet  where  the power comes from  controlled  by  a  wall
switch  that  was  turned off accidentally?&nbsp;   Is  the  power  strip
turned  on?&nbsp;  Is the light on the UPS or power strip on,  indicating
that  it  has power?&nbsp;  Is the power cable plugged into the  back  of
the  computer  correctly?&nbsp;  The socket on the back of  the  computer
where the power cable goes in is part of the power supply in  your
PC.&nbsp;    Some power supplies have a separate on/off switch,&nbsp;   usually
labeled 0/1. &nbsp;  Is that switch turned on?&nbsp;  Check the voltage  -  most
power supplies have a switch to change between 115 and 230V -  and
make sure it is set correctly.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>The power comes on but the monitor stays black</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is  the power cable for the monitor plugged in correctly?&nbsp;  Is  the
monitor  turned  on?&nbsp;  Is the cable from  the  video  card  to  the
monitor  plugged in correctly?&nbsp; Is the video card seated  properly?&nbsp;
Take  the cover off of the case,&nbsp;  remove the video card and insert
it again properly,&nbsp; then try again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  everything  is connected and powered up correctly, &nbsp;  push  the
power button again and pay close attention: &nbsp; do any lights on  the
front  of  the  PC blink or light up?&nbsp; Does the fan  in  the  power
supply  start  whirring?&nbsp; This could indicate a  hardware  problem.&nbsp;
Try  to think what happened right before the problem started.&nbsp;  Did
you add a new piece of hardware?&nbsp; If so,&nbsp;  it might be faulty or not
installed right.&nbsp;  Remove it, then try again.&nbsp; If everything is fine
without the hardware, &nbsp; try to reinstall and configure the hardware
again.&nbsp;  If that does not help, &nbsp; try exchanging it and see if  that
corrects  the  problem.&nbsp;  If the error persists, &nbsp;  narrow  it  down
systematically. &nbsp; Remove everything but the CPU,  memory, keyboard,
and video card,  then boot again.&nbsp;  Does the error still occur? &nbsp; If
not,  then add one piece of hardware and try again. &nbsp; Repeat  until
one  new  component  causes the error and you  now  know  who  the
culprit is. &nbsp; If yes,  then reseat your CPU,  memory and video card
and try again.&nbsp;  If the error still happens, try replacing the CPU,
video  card  and memory one by one to see if one of  them  is  the
troublemaker.&nbsp;   If  that does not help,   you  could  have  a  bad
motherboard.&nbsp;  Check the motherboard carefully  for  any  signs  of
damage.&nbsp;  Also check for shorts, a metallic object could have found
its way onto the motherboard,  or the motherboard is not installed
correctly and touches the case somewhere.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another  possible cause could be incorrect CPU settings.&nbsp;   If  you
replaced  the  CPU with a different one,  be sure  to  choose  the
correct settings for multiplier and bus speed,  either via jumpers
on  the motherboard or a menu in the BIOS.&nbsp;  Consult the manual for
the  correct setup.&nbsp;  If you can't even get into the BIOS to change
the settings,  use the jumper on the motherboard to clear the BIOS
and load the default settings, it should allow you to boot.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>The computer beeps several times</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you hear several beeps from the PC speaker,  it means that the
computer failed its power-on self test (POST)  because  a  problem
was  detected.&nbsp;   The  POST  is  a  procedure  that  tests  several
components such as power,  BIOS,  CPU,  memory, and video. Only if
all  those tests pass,  the computer will then allow the operating
system  to  load.&nbsp;  But if one or more of these tests fail,   beeps
indicate  a problem and the boot process is halted.&nbsp; These  errors
are a little more difficult to troubleshoot.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  diagnose the problem,  listen to the beeps carefully and write
down  the  sequence.&nbsp;  Is it one long beep? &nbsp; Is  it  several  short
beeps?&nbsp; How many?&nbsp; Once you have the beep sequence documented,   you
need  to find out what it means.&nbsp;  What BIOS do you have?&nbsp; When  you
first turn on the PC,  look at the top of the first screen to find
out.&nbsp; Common BIOS types are Award, Phoenix, and AMI.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>The system hangs after the POST</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  turned the system on,  it went through the POST process,  but
then  it stops,  does not continue to boot,  and you see no  error
messages. &nbsp; This could be caused by several things. &nbsp;  Is  the  hard
drive  that you are trying to boot from,  partitioned,  formatted,
and  have an active partition?&nbsp; Use a boot floppy to boot to a  DOS
prompt,   then  use  the  FDISK command  to  check  the  partition
information on the drive(s).</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>"Missing Operating System"</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  turned the system on,  it went through the POST process,  but
then  it  stops with an error message <B>"Missing Operating  System"</B>.&nbsp;
This  means  that  the drive it is trying  to  boot  from  has  no
operating  system  installed on it.&nbsp;  To make the  drive  bootable,
boot  with a floppy disk to a DOS prompt,  then type sys C:.&nbsp;  This
will  copy COMMAND.COM to the C:  drive to make it bootable. &nbsp; This
method also helps if COMMAND.COM has been erased or corrupted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another  possibility is that the operating  system  is  installed,
but  the  master boot record is damaged or has been altered  by  a
virus.&nbsp;  Boot with a Windows startup disk,  then run fdisk /mbr.&nbsp; It
will restore a clean master boot record.&nbsp;  <B>Caution:</B>  If your system
is  a dual-boot setup using Linux' LILO boot loader,  or NT's boot
menu,   or a third-party multi-boot utility such as Boot Magic  or
System  Commander,   or if you have to  use  some  type  of  drive
overlay  software  such  as EZ-BIOS to compensate  for  the  BIOS'
inability to recognize large hard drives,  this command will erase
this custom setup and you have to recreate it!</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B><U>"Invalid System Disk"</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  turn on the PC,  it goes through the POST,  then you get  the
error <B>"Invalid Disk.  Replace the disk and and then hit any  key."</B>&nbsp;
First, &nbsp;  check your floppy drive.&nbsp;  Is there a floppy disk  in  the
drive? &nbsp; Remove it and hit a key on your keyboard  and  see  if  it
boots  now.&nbsp;  If the floppy drive is empty and you still  get  this
error,  it means that the drive you're trying to boot from,   does
not have system files on it.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Hard drive is not detected during POST</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check  your hard drive first and make sure that the hard drive  is
properly connected.&nbsp;  Is the power cable plugged securely into  the
correct  plug?&nbsp; Is the data/ribbon cable connected correctly?&nbsp;  Make
sure  that  the red line on the ribbon cable is in line  with  the
Pin 1 markings on the IDE controller on the hard drive and on  the
hard  drive connector. &nbsp; Make sure that the hard drive is  jumpered
correctly. &nbsp; If  you  have SCSI drives,  make sure they are terminated properly
and  that you assigned the ID numbers correctly and uniquely.&nbsp;  
Also,   check the BIOS and see how it is set up to deal with  hard
drives.&nbsp;   Did  you enter the settings for the drive manually? &nbsp; Try
setting  the BIOS to auto-detect and let it find and identify  the
drive(s) automatically.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B><U>Windows does not load automatically</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your PC powers up correctly,  it passes the POST,  all drives  are
detected correctly,  but Windows does not load.&nbsp;  Instead you  only
see  a  DOS prompt. &nbsp; The reason for this could be that the Windows
directory cannot be found or accessed.&nbsp;  Boot to a DOS prompt  with
a  Windows startup disk.&nbsp;  When you're at a DOS prompt,  make  sure
you're at the C:\ prompt.&nbsp;  Then type attrib -s -h -r msdos.sys and
hit Enter to remove the system,  hidden,  and read-only attributes
for  this  file.&nbsp;  Now type edit msdos.sys and hit Enter. &nbsp;  In  the
resulting window,  look for the section titled <B>[Paths]</B> and see  if
it  has the lines WinDir=C:\Windows and WinBootDir=C:\Windows  and
make  sure  that  the  path after the '='  sign  corresponds  with
wherever Windows is installed.[Paths] If those lines are not present for
some twisted reason, add them manually as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <B>[Paths]</B><BR>
<B>WinDir=C:\Windows</B><BR>
<B>WinBootDir=C:\Windows</B><BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  making the necessary corrections,  save the file  and  exit
the  editor.&nbsp;   Now reset the correct attributes for  the  file  by
typing  attrib +s +h +r msdos.sys and hit Enter. &nbsp; Now  reboot  and
see if it now boots correctly into Windows.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Windows always displays the boot menu</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your PC powers up correctly,  it passes the POST,  all drives  are
detected  correctly,   but Windows does  not  load  automatically.&nbsp;
Instead you see a boot menu giving you different boot options.&nbsp;  To
correct  this in Windows 98,  go to Start/Run,  type msconfig  and
click  OK.&nbsp;   In the resulting window,  click on the  General  tab,
click the Advanced button and deselect Enable Startup Menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively,  you can also change this manually from  a  command
prompt. &nbsp;  Boot to a DOS prompt with a Windows startup disk.&nbsp;   When
you're at a DOS prompt,  make sure you're at the C:\ prompt.&nbsp;  Then
type  attrib  -s  -h  -r msdos.sys and hit  Enter  to  remove  the
system,  hidden,  and read-only attributes for this file.&nbsp; Now type
edit msdos.sys and hit Enter.&nbsp;  In the resulting window,  look  for
the section titled [Options].&nbsp;  This section might contain the line
BootMenu=1.  Change the '1' to a '0',  save the file and exit  the
editor.&nbsp;  Now reset the correct attributes for the file  by  typing
attrib +s +h +r msdos.sys and hit Enter.&nbsp;  Now reboot and see if it
now boots automatically into Windows.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet  another way of changing these options are via TweakUI. &nbsp; Under
the  Boot  tab  in TweakUI you will find an option  to  active  or
deactivate  the  boot  menu,  as well as changing  the  boot  menu
delay. </P>
<BR>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>"Cannot find WIN.COM, unable to continue loading Windows"</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your PC powers up correctly,  it passes the POST,  all drives  are
detected  correctly,   but Windows does  not  load  automatically.&nbsp;
Instead you see an error message "Cannot find WIN.COM,  unable  to
continue  loading  Windows".&nbsp;  Check to see  if  WIN.COM  is  still
present on the hard drive.&nbsp;  It should be located in the C:\Windows
folder. &nbsp;  If it was accidentally renamed and you can identify  the
file,  name it back to WIN.COM and reboot.&nbsp; If the file was deleted
and  you  are  not  able  to restore it,  reinstall  Windows  over
itself.&nbsp;   It will recreate all the system files including  WIN.COM
while  retaining  all  the  settings from  your  existing  Windows
installation.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>"Cannot find a file that may be needed to run Windows"</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your PC powers up correctly,  it passes the POST,  all drives  are
detected  correctly,   but Windows does  not  load  automatically.
Instead you see the following error message:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows  or  a
Windows  application.&nbsp;   The Windows registry  or  SYSTEM.INI  file
refers to this device file,  but the device file no longer exists.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you  deleted  this  file  on purpose,   try  uninstalling  the
associated  application using its uninstall or setup program.&nbsp;   If
you  still want to use the application associated with this device
file,   try  reinstalling that application to replace the  missing
file. (filename)</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Press a key to continue</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  happens when a Windows system file is renamed or deleted  by
accident.&nbsp;  Most importantly,&nbsp;  when you see this screen,&nbsp;  stop  and
write down the name of the file in question.&nbsp;  Then push a key  and
see if Windows will continue to load after all,  often it will.&nbsp; To
correct  the problem,  you need to extract a copy of  the  missing
file from the Windows Cab files.&nbsp;  If you have Windows 98, this can
be  done  pretty easily if you can still get into Windows  with  a
command called System File Checker,  or short SFC.&nbsp;  If you  cannot
get  into Windows anymore or don't have Windows 98,  you  need  to
use  the  Extract  command  from the  DOS  prompt.</P>
<BR>
<BR>   
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Registry Errors</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your PC powers up correctly,  it passes the POST,  all drives  are
detected  correctly,   but Windows does  not  load  automatically.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead  you  see  an  error message about  a  problem  with  your
registry.&nbsp;  This can happen either when the registry was  corrupted
by  a  bad software installation,  or if one of the registry files
was  accidentally deleted.&nbsp;   Windows 98 makes  it  pretty  easy  to
restore  a good copy of the registry.&nbsp;   If it encounters an  error,
it  will  usually just inform you of the error and  then  restart,
restore  a  previous version of the registry and  you're  back  in
business. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you run into problems with this method, restart your
computer  and  hold down the Control (Ctrl)  key during  the  boot
process until you see the boot menu.&nbsp;   Choose option #5 to boot  to
the  Command  Prompt Only. &nbsp;  At the DOS prompt,   type  in  scanreg
/restore.&nbsp;   You will be presented with a list of previous  registry
backups.&nbsp;    Select the one that you believe to  be  error-free  and
restore it. &nbsp;  When this process it is done,  you'll be prompted  to
restart and Windows should boot correctly now.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Summary</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  you  can  see,  most boot problems can be corrected relatively
easy.&nbsp;  <B>Stay calm</B>,  approach the problem systematically,  work your
way  through this check list,  and chances are that  you  will  be
back in business earlier than you expected.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However to save you time and money and stop yourself pulling your hair out, Print out this article and keep it in a safe place for future reference.</P>
