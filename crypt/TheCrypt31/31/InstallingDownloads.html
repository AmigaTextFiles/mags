<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Downloading a file means getting a file from a remote computer and putting it 
on your computer (uploading means the opposite. So you download to get a 
file, and upload to send one).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a great way to get software or data files, and downloading is used 
for many purposes.  For example, you might download a game or some utility 
program for your computer like a fancy clock that displays on the desktop.  There 
are programs, such as an upgrade to your virus protection software that you can 
purchase from a web site that lets you download the software after processing 
your credit card order.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Downloading adds one or two steps to installation, but if you want the 
program at the moment without going out shopping for it, it is well worth it; once, 
of course, you get the hang of it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you download a file, Windows will ask you what folder to put the file 
in.  (If you are using AOL, you will usually be directed to the folder 
C:\Programs Files\America Online 8.0\download or something like that).  When the 
download is complete, use Windows Explorer to find this folder and the new file in 
it.  Then you use the setup.exe file to install the program you downloaded.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Here are the steps for installing a downloaded program:</B></P>

<B>1.</B> &nbsp; Download the file from the website (Note:  when a website has a file that 
you can download, generally there will be help offered right on the website 
that will give you information for the download and installation of the file).  
After giving the command to download, your computer will show you which 
folder the downloaded file will go in; you can change the folder or let it go into 
the one that Windows suggests.  In either case, note the folder name so that 
you can find the file when you are ready to install it.

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2.</B> &nbsp; Using Windows Explorer, find your download on your hard drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3.</B>&nbsp;  If the file is a <B>ZIP</B> or other kind of archive file, decompress it using 
an <B>UNZIP</B> program such as <B>Winzip</B> or <B>PKUNZIP</B>.    If the file is an EXE file (such 
as setup.exe) skip to <B>step 4</B>. </P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.</B> &nbsp; Run the setup program as discussed in the article on running setup.exe 
from disk.  This will install the program.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5.</B>&nbsp;  Delete the downloaded file. You can keep it if you choose to do so, but 
it is not necessary; It is no longer needed once the program has been 
installed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with any new files, it is a good idea run a virus check on the files you 
download before running them.  In addition, after you have installed the 
software, run the check on the folder you installed to.  Downloads from reputable 
websites are usually checked, but it never hurts to check for yourself.  </P>
