<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fire fighter was working on the engine outside the station when 
he noticed a little girl next door with a little red wagon with tiny
ladders hung off the side and a garden hose tightly coiled in the
middle. The girl was wearing a fire fighter's helmet and had the 
wagon tied to a dog and a cat.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fire fighter walked over to take a closer look. <B>"That sure is a
nice fire truck,"</B> the fire fighter said with admiration.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Thanks</B></I>, " said the little girl.</P>

tied the wagon to the dog's collar and to the cat's testicles.</P>

to run your fire truck, but if you were to tie that cord around the
cat's collar, along with the Dog's, I think you could go faster."</B></P>

have a siren.</B></I>"<IMG SRC="Images/firebell.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="120" ALT="firebell.gif"></P>
