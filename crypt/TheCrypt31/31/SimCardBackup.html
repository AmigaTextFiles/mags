<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Losing your mobile is social suicide. Don't risk it. Copy all the info from your SIM onto the SIM Card Backup in just two seconds! Don't lose your friends because you've lost your mobile phone. With the SIM Card Backup, you can take a copy of all the information on your SIM card as many times as you like, then just copy it on to a new card when you need to!</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These days few of us bother to memorise phone numbers or add them to an address book when it's so easy to simply programme them into a mobile. The problem with this is if you lose your mobile or it conks out, you've no idea of anyone's phone number. And no phone numbers equals social suicide.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SIM Card Backup is like having an address book without all the bother of writing in the names and numbers. And it couldn't be simpler to use. Simply remove the SIM card from your mobile, insert it into the SIM Card Backup and press the downward arrow button for two seconds. A red LED will light up, and when it goes out, your numbers are saved. It's that simple.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're a social butterfly who gets dozens of new numbers a week, you'll be pleased to know you can save copies of your SIM as many times as you like. And loading your numbers to a new SIM is just as easy. Simply repeat the process for copying the card info, only pressing the upward arrow button instead of the downward arrow.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as being incredibly useful and simple to use, the SIM Card Backup is tiny enough to carry about in your pocket or on a keyring, making it ultra-convenient to update your SIM copy every time you add a new number. You could even buy two and keep one in your desk drawer at the office and another at home.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Never again need you lose out on a potential client, or potential date, because you've lost your phone. Just don't tell people you want to get rid of that you've bought the SIM Backup - that way they'll believe your `I lost my mobile' excuse for never calling.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The SIM Card Backup can hold up to 255 names and numbers.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Measures 4.5 x 3cm.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">1 x GP192 Alkaline Cell - can be replaced without losing any data.</P>
