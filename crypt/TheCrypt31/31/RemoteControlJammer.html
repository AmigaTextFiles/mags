<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  your  partner  is  always changing channels,   don't  throw  a
wobbly,  simply reply 'of course you can love' - have we gone mad?
No there's method in our madness.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Remote  Control  Jammer is a tiny but ingenious  gadget  that
will  make  sure the channel you want on stays on.   It  jams  any
infra  red remote control - TV,  video or stereo - and  noone  but
you  will be able to fix it.  And because the jammer is so  small,
no  one  will  even see you press it,  so your secret stays  safe.
Then,   when your favourite show is finished,  you can  "fix"  the
remote,  leaving everyone so grateful that they don't have to walk
all  the  way  over  to  the set to change channels  that  they'll
probably  let you watch what you want for the rest  of  the  night
anyway!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  need  never  again  sit through "<B>Changing  Rooms</B>"  and  "<B>Ally
McBeal</B>" when you know the football is on the other side.  With the
Remote Control Jammer, what you say goes.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Q.</B> Does the Remote Control jammer only work on Tv/Videos etc or does it work on any IR Device, eg : Car remote controls?</P>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>A.</B> The remote jammer is designed to work on TV frequencies - it should not work on car alarms etc.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Q.</B> Will this work in the U.S.? Does it support all formats?</P>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>A.</B> The US does work on the same / similar IR frequency for the TV however it is not our core market and we have not done any research into their rules and regulations regarding this so we cannot confirm that it will work.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Q.</B> What range will this work from?</P>
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>A.</B> It needs to be approx 2m from the infra red receiver.</P>
