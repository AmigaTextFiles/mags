<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly my friends, i have to admit, I'm getting old, But as they say Old age doesn't come by itself, and this is very true. My faithful Amiga and all its bit and pieces are also starting to feel their age.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My grateful thanks to the 60 odd people who took great delight in Emailing me to tell me my Computer clock had reset itself to <B>02-Sep-92</B>. Truth be known my accelerator battery has ended its useful life. So what now ... off to the shops to buy a replacement? OR has some nice Amiga person out there already solved this problem for me?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first utility i discovered was Timeswipe. A easy to install little program that runs from your Workbench-Startup drawer. Instalation was a Breeze.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you first run Timeswipe, it asks a few questions then saves a log
file containing your clock`s date to S:.
Then when you boot, it checks to see if the current date is before
or too far ahead of the one in the logfile, if it is, it 
warns you with an OS2+ requester. And asks you if you wish to 
set the date.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Timeswipe is an excellent utility, When starting your Amiga and it is displaying the incorrect time, Timeswipe not only informs you of this fact, but also allows you to open up the "Time Prefs" screen (without the need to open WB/Prefs/Time. Then it is a simple matter of re-setting your battery clock to the correct time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually Timeswipe is more useful IF you have a working batteryclock installed. Then you would be informed should the clock reset after a crash, Never again will you receive those gloating mails from people who make a habit of ensuring everyones clock is correct to the Second.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>Although Timeswipe is a good program, I was looking for more ...So onward and upward.</CENTER>
