<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you purchase a program, it usually comes on a CD-ROM or floppy disk.  In 
almost every case, the setup program is called <B>Setup.exe</B>, and is located in 
the main folder of the disk (or disk 1 if you have a multiple floppy disk 
installation).  The setup program is called a Wizard; this is a simple step-by-step 
program that guides you through the installation and helps you make choices.</P>  


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Program developers usually try to make the installation easy since this is 
your first impression of their product.  If you are asked something by the Setup 
program that you do not understand, the best bet is to accept the default 
answer.  For example, if you are asked whether you want the Standard or Custom 
setup, you cannot go wrong by picking Standard.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many installation CDs start automatically when you put them into your CD-ROM 
drive.  They may just start Setup.exe automatically, or a little window will 
pop up with choices like:</P>

- Install Microsoft Word (Microsoft Word is used as an example here; in your 
setup, your program name would appear)<BR>
- Read Microsoft Word Readme<BR>
- Run the Tutorial To Learn Microsoft Word<BR>
- Exit<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Setup.exe would start when you choose Install, which usually is the first 
choice.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the CD does not start automatically (it may be the way it was made), or if 
you got the program on floppy disks, you have to tell Windows to start 
Setup.exe.  This is a simple command; you just tell Windows which drive the setup 
program is on and the name of the program.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drives are named with letters followed by a colon.  Your floppy drive is most 
likely to be drive A:.  Your hard disk drive is most likely to be C:.  If you 
only have one hard drive, the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is likely to be drive 
D: or a letter of the alphabet beyond that.  If you have more than one ROM dri
ve, it is probably the last letter used.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But you don't have to guess: start Windows Explorer.  The CD-ROM or DVD-ROM 
drive letter will be next to the little picture of a ROM disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now insert the CD or floppy into its drive and click the Start button.  
Choose Run.  Click the Browse button.  At the top of the resulting dialog box, you 
will see the words Look In.  Next to that is a drop-down list box.  Click the 
down arrow to the right of this box; which will display all the drives on your 
computer.  Click on the drive that has your disk in it.  Once you do that, in 
the pane in the middle of the dialog box, you will see the setup file.  Click 
on it; click the Open button.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will take you back to the Run dialog box; click the OK button and the 
setup program will begin.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it is extremely rare with newer programs, sometimes a program does 
not have an install and you are asked to set it up manually on your system.  If 
you do not feel comfortable manually installing a program you should not do 
it.  Either find a similar program with a good installation program, or get in 
touch with your local computer geek to help you install it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the quickest ways to free up storage space on your computer is to 
uninstall programs that you do not use anymore.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>There are five ways you can uninstall a program:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>-</B>&nbsp;  Delete the files from your hard drive. This is NOT a good way to uninstall 
a program. There are literally hundreds of places that a program can keep 
files, registry entries, and bits and pieces of files and such. By simply 
deleting the program files from your computer, you will not be able to remove all the 
extra files and pieces. All these junk files will be left on your computer 
and eventually slow things down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>-</B>&nbsp;  Use the Add/Remove Programs function in the Control Panel. This is a 
standard Windows removal tool that actually does a pretty good job of removing 
programs from your hard drive.  To access the Add/Remove Programs function, click 
the Start button, choose Control Panel, choose Add/Remove Programs.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>- </B>&nbsp; Use the program's uninstall procedure. Many programs come with their own 
uninstall program that will quickly remove programs from your computer. Some 
installers do not put their program on the Add/Remove list, so your next place 
to look is in the Start menu. Find the group for that program and see if there 
is an item called Uninstall. If so, pick it and the Uninstaller will run.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is no menu item, look in the folder containing the program. There 
may be an uninstall.exe there. If so, double click it and the Uninstaller will 
run.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>- </B>&nbsp; Reinstall the program. Sometimes the easiest way to uninstall a program is 
to reinstall it, then remove it using its own uninstall program (see above)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>-</B>&nbsp;  Use a third-party removal tool. A third party tool (such as Norton 
Uninstall or Clean Sweep) will be extremely thorough in removing programs. You will 
be able to uninstall any program on your computer, even if it does not show up 
in the Add/Remove list or have an uninstall feature built in.  Some uninstall 
programs will detect files called Orphans, which are programs and files to 
which there is no connection; you'll then be able to delete them, too.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often an Uninstaller does not delete everything. If it does not, it will tell 
you what it has saved. Uninstallers will not delete data files you created 
with the program, in case you want to keep them to use with a different program 
(although it is always a good idea to back up all important files before 
uninstalling the program used to create them). The Uninstaller usually tells you 
where to look for these files in case you want to delete them. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, uninstalling programs will not uninstall shared files, which 
are usually DLL files. Some DLL files are used by many different programs and 
the Uninstaller may not know if a particular one is used by a different program. 
In this case it will ask you whether it should delete the file or not. If you 
do not know, say <B>No</B>. If no other programs actually use the file it will not 
hurt anything, but if other programs do use the file, deleting it could make 
them stop working.</P>
