<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him.&nbsp; The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd, " <I><B>If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one</B></I> ?

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully grazing flock and calmly answered,&nbsp; "<B>Sure.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his notebook and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas.&nbsp; He sent an email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response.&nbsp; Finally, he prints out a 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says, " <I><B>You have exactly 1586 sheep.</B></I> "</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">" <B>That is correct; take one of the sheep.</B>" &nbsp; said the shepherd.&nbsp; He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundles it into his car.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Then the shepherd says:&nbsp; "<B>If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my sheep?</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">" <B><I>OK, why not." answered the young man.</I></B>&nbsp; "<B>Clearly, you are a consultant.</B>" said the shepherd.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">" <I><B>That's correct</B></I>, " &nbsp;says the yuppie,&nbsp; " <I><B>but how did you guess that</B></I> ?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Well</B>,"&nbsp;answers the shepherd.&nbsp; "<B>You turned up here, although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you know nothing about my business.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Now give me back my dog.</B>"</P>
