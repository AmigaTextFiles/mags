<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  Sunday morning William burst into the living room  and  said,
"<B>Dad! &nbsp; Mom!&nbsp;  I have some great news for you! &nbsp; I am getting married
to  the  most beautiful girl in town.&nbsp;  She lives a block away  and
her name is Susan.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After dinner, &nbsp; William's dad took him aside. &nbsp; "<I><B>Son, I have to talk
with you. &nbsp; Your mother and I have been married 30 years.&nbsp;  She's  a
wonderful  wife but she has never offered much excitement  in  the
bedroom, &nbsp;  so  I used to fool around with women a lot.  &nbsp; Susan  is
actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William  was  heart-broken. &nbsp;  After  eight  months  he  eventually
started  dating girls again.&nbsp;  A year later he came home  and  very
proudly  announced,&nbsp;  "<B>Diane said yes! &nbsp; We're  getting  married  in
June."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William was furious! &nbsp; He finally decided to go to his mother  with
the news.&nbsp;  "<B>Dad has done so much harm. &nbsp; I guess I'm never going to
get  married,  "</B> he complained.&nbsp; <B> "Every time I fall in love, &nbsp;  Dad
tells me the girl is my half-sister.</B>"</P>
