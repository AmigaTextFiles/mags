<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E-mail  is sent in the form of an Internet Protocol Packet.   Your
computer divides the e-mail message into smaller-sized  chunks  of
data (packets)  which are then sent out over the Internet.  Almost
anything  can be put in an IP packet:  e-mails,  the text  from  a
book,   lines of code from a computer program,  pictures  of  your
kids, or sounds and music from your favorite video. IP packets are
what travel across the Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These  packets not only carry the chunks of data (like  an  e-mail
message),  but they add on some additional information,   too.   A
header,   which  is  tacked on to the  front  of  the  IP  packet,
contains this extra information.  The header contains the  address
of  your  computer  which is sending the data (called  the  source
address),  the address of where the data is going (the destination
address),  and a number that verifies that nothing got lost  along
the way (called a checksum).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  your  e-mail leaves your computer network (AOL for example),
a  router sends that message towards the destination.  And towards
means  just that.  Your computer network is not directly connected
to  your  friendâs  computer network.  There are actually  several
networks in between.  (The Internet is a network of networks.) The
router  sends your message in the right direction.   At  the  next
network,  your IP packet encounters the router on that network. It
looks  at  the destination address and forwards it on towards  the
next  appropriate network.  Your IP packet will go through several
different  networks  and routers before  it  finally  reaches  its
destination   even  if  you're sending  it  to  your  next  door
neighbour.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  makes  IP  packet routing so amazing is  how  quickly  these
steps  are  accomplished.  How long does all of this take?  An  IP
packet  sent  from  New York to Los Angeles,   stopping  at  every
router  along  the way,  could take as little as two-tenths  of  a
second to make the entire trip coast-to-coast.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  routers  know  where  to send the email  by  the  destination
address  that you input.  The destination address  is  the  e-mail
address of the person you're sending the e-mail to.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just  like  everybody has a unique U.S.  Postal service  name  and
mailing  address  combination,  each user on the  Internet  has  a
unique  e-mail  address  -  a name and address  combination  which
nobody else has.  E-mail addresses are in a different format  than
regular  mail  addresses,   yet   they  tell  a  large  amount  of
information in a small amount of space.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<CENTER>This is a typical e-mail address:.........       <B>President@Whitehouse.gov</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>President</B><BR>
The first part of the e-mail address is that person's username, in this case, 
President.  When someone logs on to the network, they must identify 
themselves by keying in their username, which has been set by the network 
administrator.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>@</B><BR>
There can be people on the Internet with the same username (just like there 
are many John Smiths in the phone book)  The @  symbol says that this 
username is located at the following computer address - the username has to be 
unique at that computer address.  Everything that follows the @ sign is called 
the domain name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Whitehouse</B><BR>
This part of the e-mail address is called the host name (the host name is 
part of the domain name).  It identifies the name of the computer which this 
person is connected to.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>.gov</B><BR>
The final part of the domain name - and of the entire Internet address - is a 
code indicating either the type of organization or the location of that host 
computer.<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Following is a list of the seven organizational domains which you will find 
on the Net:</P>

<B>com ....Commercial company</B><BR>
<B>edu....       Education Institution</B><BR>
<B>gov ....      Government</B><BR>
<B>int ....       International Organization</B><BR>
<B>mil ....      Military</B><BR>
<B>net....       Network Gateway </B><BR>
<B>org ....      Nonprofit Organization</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some computers use geographical domains, which indicate its location rather 
than the function of the computer.  For example:</P>

<B>au&nbsp;&nbsp;  Australia</B><BR>
<B>ca&nbsp;&nbsp;  Canada</B><BR>
<B>it&nbsp;&nbsp;  Italy</B><BR>
<B>mx&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mexico</B><BR>
<B>us&nbsp;&nbsp;  United States</B><BR>
<B>uk&nbsp;&nbsp;  United Kingdom</B><BR>
