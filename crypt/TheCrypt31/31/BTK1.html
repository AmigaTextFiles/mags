<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid,  as he is commonly known, left no record of his place
of  birth  and  date.  Pat Garrett and Ash Upson,  who  wrote  the
biography,   <B>"The  Authentic Life of Billy  the  Kid,   the  Noted
Desperado of the Southwest,  whose Deeds of Daring and Blood  Have
Made  His  Name  a  Terror  in New Mexico,  Arizona  and  Northern
Mexico,"</B> came up with November 23,  1859,  in New York City.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This information  for  years  had been accepted  as  the  actual  birth
record  of  Billy the Kid,  but today it's highly questionable  as
being  legitimate.  Aside from no convincing proof,   November  23
happens  to be Ash Upson's birth date.  Did he remember the  Kid's
birthday because it was the same as his or did he choose the  date
as a tribute to himself?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While The Kids Birth  date remains a complete mystery,  New York,  Indiana,
and  Missouri  have become the potential of being the  birthplace,
but  census records have failed to produce the proper information.
Historians and biographers today have come to the conclusion  that
the Kid's birth date and where he was born may remain a mystery.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However The  Kid's  childhood
friends in Silver City claimed he was about twelve in 1873;  while
his  friends,   George and Frank Coe,  say he was about  seventeen
during the Lincoln County War in the early year of 1878,  and Lily
Casey,  a Lincoln county resident,  would say when she encountered
the  Kid in early November of 1877,  he was barely sixteen.   This
indicates  he may have been born in 1860-61,  making  his  age  of
death nineteen or twenty.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid,
the  year 1859 may have been used to make the Kid twenty-one years
old at the time of his death.  So,  when Garrett kills the Kid, it
would  sound  better  to  have killed a  man  of  twenty-one  than
possibly a youth still in his teens.</P>

<B>Now  what about his name?</B><BR> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is most famously known as <B>William
H.  Bonney</B>,  but as a child,  he was <B>Henry McCarty</B>. But was <B>Henry</B>,
really  his  first  name?  When  his  mother,   Catherine  McCarty
remarried  a  man named William Antrim,  the family  now  had  two
Williams.   So Catherine started calling him by his  middle  name,
<B>Henry</B>.   Childhood  friend  of   Silver  City  Chauncey  Truesdell
recalls,  "<B>Henry's</B> first name was <B>Billy</B>,  but they called  him  by
his  middle  name  to  keep him from getting  mixed  up  with  his
stepfather."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid had a brother named Joseph,  and it's been thought  he
was  the older of the two,  but records show he may have been  the
younger brother.  When the boys' mother remarried,  her sons  were
listed in the Book of Marriages A of Santa Fe County as witnesses:</P>

 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From  the time he was born till about 1870,  the Kid  left  no
traces of his life.  All we know is that, in 1870, widow Catherine
McCarty  and her two sons arrived in Kansas,  accompanied  by  her
long  time  boyfriend,  William Antrim.  Mrs.   McCarty  opened  a
laundry service and bought and sold town lots to earn money.   The
widow  was making a rather good living supporting herself and  her
sons,  until a doctor diagnosed her with tuberculosis and told her
to seek a warmer and drier climate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Loading  up her family along with William Antrim,  she  headed
west to Colorado and then south to Santa Fe,  New Mexico, where on
March  1,   1873,   in  a Presbyterian church,  Catherine  married
Antrim.   After the wedding,  the family headed  south  to  Silver
City.  The warmer climate there was hoped to benefit Mrs. Antrim's
health  and  the  opportunities   of   mining  would  benefit  her
prospecting husband.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In early April the family arrived in the crowded city and were
lucky to acquire a cabin in the quickly growing town.  Mr.  Antrim
found  work as a carpenter and a butcher,  but spent most  of  his
time  prospecting and gambling.  Mrs.  Antrim took in boarders  in
their  tiny cabin and sold homemade pies and sweet cakes  to  make
ends meet.  As for her boys,  they ran with the other children  in
town,   getting into harmless mischief until the school opened  in
January.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  of  the residents and children who knew  the  Kid  as  a
youngster  in  Silver City remember him affectionately.   Chauncey
Truesdell remembers,  "<I>Henry was only a small boy,  small for  his
age  and  kind of skinny.</I>" Louis Abraham,  another schoolmate  and
friend  recalls,  "<I>He was just an ordinary boy,  I don't  remember
him  doing  anything bad,  he was just a little mischievous.</I>"  All
deny  the story of his killing a man who had insulted his  mother;
there is also no legal or newspaper record of such an incident.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid in his younger years is remembered as being  slender,
having  small hands and rather girlish looking.  Because  of  this
stature,   he was a target for bullies and teasing,  but  what  he
lacked  in size he made up in courage and a quick mind.   He  also
had  a wonderful sense of humor,  always joking and laughing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He had  a  passion for music,  singing and dancing.  He was  a  well-
behaved  student in school and liked to read.  He  wasn't  a  loud
obnoxious  brat  like some of the other boys  he  ran  with,   but
rather  quiet and mild mannered.  Not only his childhood  friends,
but  also  those in later years,  all agreed he was an  easygoing,
lighthearted fellow,  loyal,  courteous,  and brave almost to  the
point  of  recklessness.  Even his enemies admitted  he  had  good
qualities.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up until this point,  like Louis Abraham said,  "he was just an
ordinary  boy." But as fate would have it,  the Kid's  life  would
turn upside down and never be the same again. <B>Ever</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately,  Mrs.  Antrim's health was deteriorating rapidly
and  she  became bedridden.  To make matters worse,   her  husband
seemed to have deserted his family when they needed him the  most,
by taking to the hills for prospecting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On September 16,  1874, Catherine Antrim died. When her husband
finally  returned,  he moved his stepsons to live with the  Knight
family. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  boys  continued   their   schooling,   while  their
stepfather would come and go.  In a matter of time,  the boys were
separated  and  bounced from one foster family to  another.   Bill
Antrim  relieved himself from any parental guidance and  left  the
boys to fend for themselves, while he moved to Arizona.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this time the Kid took advantage of his freedom  to  do
as  he  pleased without any parental supervision,  but because  he
was  on  his own,  he lacked money and so he began his  career  of
crime.   His first offense was stealing several pounds  of  butter
from  a  rancher,  which he turned around and sold to a  merchant.
The sheriff found out and after a tongue-lashing,  he let the  Kid
go with a warning.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was a year after Catherine Antrim's death and the Kid  was
now  living at Mrs.  Brown's boarding house.  To earn money,   the
thirteen  or  fourteen (?)  year old youngster washed  dishes  and
waited  on tables at the Star Hotel.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He soon befriended  a  young
man  named George Schaefer,  alias <B>Sombrero Jack</B>.  He was a thief,
drunk  and gambler and would no doubt,  become a bad influence  on
the  impressionable boy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this time the Kid  was  looking  poor
and  dressed  in  worn out clothes.  <B>Sombrero Jack</B>  had  stolen  a
bundle of laundry from a Chinese launderer and since the  Kid  had
no decent clothes,  he gave the bundle to him, if he wanted to run
the  risk  of getting caught with it. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs.  Brown discovered  the
bundle  hidden  in a trunk in the Kid's room and reported  him  to
the  sheriff.  The Kid was arrested and locked in jail.  The  city
newspaper,   The  Grant County Herald printed  the  story:   <B>"It's
believed  that  Henry was simply the tool of Sombrero  Jack,   who
done  the actual stealing whilst Henry done the hiding.  Jack  has
since  skinned  out."</B>  So,  the Kid  was  left  holding  the  bag,
literally.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  sheriff was sympathetic towards the Kid and allowed  him
free  run  of  the  corridor for a limited time till  his  hearing
before  the courts.  After only two days of confinement,  the  Kid
escaped up the fireplace in the corridor and then fled to  one  of
his foster families,  the Truesdells.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid's stepfather,  Bill
Antrim  had  gone  to Clifton,  Arizona for prospecting,   so  the
Truesdells gave him some money and put him on a stage to  Arizona.
The  boy  had  hoped  to  find refuge with  his  stepfather,   but
unfortunately,  when the Kid told him what he had happened, Antrim
responded with <B>"If that's the kind of boy you are, get out!"</B></P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid was now alone and homeless in the Arizona desert.   It
was  dangerous for an adult man to be alone in this hostile  area,
let alone a teenage boy.  He wandered around and lived a hand-and-
mouth existence.  The Kid had trouble finding work because of  his
youthfulness and slender build,  which made him  unable  to  do  a
man's job.  He then met and went into partnership with a man named
<B>John Mackie</B>,  another thief who would influence the Kid.  The  duo
began a career of stealing saddles and horses,  particularly  from
the army in the Camp Grant area.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  were  eventually caught and thrown  into  jail  at  Camp
Grant,   but  the Kid escaped and fled.  A few months  later,   he
turned up again in the area.  This naïve attitude of returning  to
the  scene of a crime would be his downfall throughout  his  short
life.  Either that,  or,  after being alone again he was returning
to  familiar  haunts and maybe looking for Mackie.   Whatever  the
case, the Kid was back.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Probably after joining up with Mackie,  The Kid had  developed
his famous nickname by which he would be forever known- <B>"Kid."</B>  It
wasn't  only  because  he was one,  but he  certainly  looked  it.
Because  of that,  a husky bully blacksmith at Camp Grant,   named
<B>Frank "Windy" Cahill</B> immediately took pleasure in picking  on  the
Kid every time he saw him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gus Gildea, who was working as a ranch
hand,  recalls the Kid having trouble with Cahill,  <B>"Shortly after
the  Kid came to Fort Grant,  Windy started abusing him.  He would
throw  Billy to the floor,  ruffle his hair,  slap  his  face  and
humiliate him before the men in the saloon." </B>Finally,  the Kid had
enough.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On August 18,  1877, the Kid had a run in with his tormentor at
Atkins's  cantina.  Cahill called the  Kid  a  pimp  and  the  Kid
returned the insult by calling him a son of a bitch. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cahill  then
plowed  into  the  Kid  and wrestled him to  the  ground.   Gildea
recorded,  <B>"Windy threw the youth on the floor.  He  sat  on  him,
pinned  his  arms  down  with his knees and started  slapping  his
face.   Billy worked his right arm free and managed to  grasp  his
.45.  Then there was a deafening roar.  Windy slumped to the  side
as  the Kid squirmed free."</B></P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the Kid shot Cahill mortally  in
the  stomach,  he bolted out the door,  mounted the nearest  horse
and  skinned out.  As it turned out,  the Kid rode off on a prized
racehorse,  but when he found another mount he sent  the  valuable
animal back to its owner.  Despite previous abuse and Cahill being
much larger and getting the upper hand in the fight,  the shooting
was considered unjustifiable.</P> 

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  with  a murder rap hanging over him,  the young  fugitive
hightailed  it  back  to New Mexico.  He dropped  by  on  his  old
friends  the Knights and the Truesdell,  but then he  kept  going.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  again the Kid found himself alone and vulnerable.  He headed
southeast  from Silver City to Dona Ana County,  where  he  joined
one  of  the most notorious gangs of rustlers and killers  in  the
southwest;   their  leader   was   <B>Jesse  Evans</B>  and  they  called
themselves <B>"The Boys."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though  Jesse Evans was captain of the gang,  the coordinator
of  the  gang's rustling activities was John Kinney also known  as
King  of the Rustlers.  The stolen cattle and horses were sold  to
those  who  didn't ask questions.  It was an illegal and organized
operation  and  no  one was willing to risk their  lives  to  stop
them,  including the law.  But Colonel Albert Fountain, who at the
time  was editor of The Mesilla Valley Independent,  was not  only
exploiting  them in his paper,  but also putting pressure  on  the
law to do something.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the law cracking down on them,  the gang eventually moved
towards  Lincoln County about 150 miles north- east  of  Dona  Ana
County.  <B>The Kid was now heading into legend.</B></P>
