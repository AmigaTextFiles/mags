 <P ALIGN="LEFT">An Italian, a Scotsman and a Chinese fellow are hired at construction site.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The foreman points out a huge pile of sand.
 He says to the Italian guy, "<B>You're in charge of sweeping.</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the Scotsman
he says, "<B>You're in charge of shoveling.</B>" And to the Chinese guy, "<B>You're
 in charge of supplies.</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He then says, "<B>Now, I have to leave for a little
 while. I expect you guys to make a dent in that there pile of sand.</B>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So when the foreman returns, after being away for a couple of hours, the
 pile of sand is untouched.  He asks the Italian, "<B>Why didn't you sweep any
 of it?</B>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foreman is really angry now.  He storms off toward the pile of sand to
 look for the Chinese guy.  Just then, the Chinese guy leaps out from behind
 the pile of sand and yells...</P>
