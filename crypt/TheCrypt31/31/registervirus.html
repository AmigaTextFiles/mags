<p align="center"><font size="+3">Sobig beats Blaster in Top of the Viral Pops</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p> <font size="+1">By John Leyden Posted: 01/09/2003 at 10:35 GMT</font> </p>
<p>Sobig eclipsed Blaster in the August viral charts.</p>
<p> More than a third of support calls (37.6 per cent) logged by AV firm Sophos 
  in August involved Sobig, twice as many (18.8 per cent) as that received about 
  the prolific Blaster worm. Managed services firm MessageLabs has blocked more 
  than 12.8 million Sobig-infected emails, since the appearance of Sobig-F on 
  August 18. At the peak of infection, one in 17 emails MessageLabs scanned harboured 
  the virus. IntY, which provides malicious code screening services for SMEs, 
  reckons one in three emails in a sample of UK small businesses contained the 
  virus at the peak of the outbreak.</p>
<p> August 2003 was the worst month for malicious code on record, according to 
  Sophos, with four of the top ten viral entries in the firm's chart arriving 
  for the first time this month. ® </p>
