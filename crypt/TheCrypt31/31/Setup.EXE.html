<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why can't you just copy a file someplace and run it?  It used to work like 
that, years ago  before Windows came on the scene.  Now, setting up most 
programs to work in Windows is complicated, but setup.exe does all the work for you. </P>
 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A basic setup program:</P>

<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Windows programs consist of many files, each of which has to be located 
in a specific place relative to the main program file.  Sometimes these are in 
subfolders of the program's main folder.  Other times they are in other 
folders.  And sometimes, parts of files getting added into existing files that make 
your computer run.  Luckily, the setup program knows exactly where everything 
belongs and what to do.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most setup programs will give you some choices though.  For example, you can 
change the folder the program is installed into.  There may be a good reason 
to do this  maybe you have an old version of this program that you want to 
keep and use occasionally  if you do, you don't want the new version to go in 
the same folder and replace the older version.  If this is not the case, or you 
are not sure, use the default folder suggested by Setup.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another choice is the name of the Start Menu group for this program.  Most 
times the name of the company that makes the program is suggested (i.e. 
Microsoft). You may replace this with the program name, or anything else that will 
help you remember what the menu item is actually for.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While almost any setup performs those two basic functions, copying files and 
creating Start Menu entries, many do a lot more.  Here are a few of the other 
things a Setup might do:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Register Your Program:</B>  Some programs need a registration code to qualify 
them as registered.  If so, during the setup process, you will be prompted for a 
registration number.  This registration number is usually found somewhere on 
the package the software came in.  In the case of a downloaded program, you'll 
usually find the registration number in the README file. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Enter Your Name and Company:</B>  Some programs require at least a name in order 
to install properly.  This means that you will be the registered owner and 
user of the program.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Set Initial Settings:</B>  Often the setup will write settings specific to your 
computer (like where to find data files, or which browser to use).  It checks 
your computer during setup to find out where things are on your system, then 
sets the program with the correct locations.  Some setup programs look for 
earlier installations so it can ask if you want to bring your old settings into the 
new version.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Set Associations:</B>  A setup may set certain file types to always open using 
the program it is setting up.  For example a graphics editor might be associated 
with the graphic file formats it supports.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Special Setups:</B>  Some programs will run faster if you install the whole thing 
on your hard drive.  But this may take more room that you want it to.  It may 
be possible to only install the most necessary files onto your drive, and 
read the rest, as needed, from the CD-ROM drive.  A Setup program can give you 
these options, or may let you chose which elements to install. </P>
