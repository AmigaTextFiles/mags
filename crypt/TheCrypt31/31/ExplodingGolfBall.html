<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Golf  has  a  reputation as not the most  exciting  sport  in  the
world.   So  is  it  a  bore best left to men in diamond-patterned
jumpers,   or can it be livened up? Of course it can,  with  these
novelty golf balls.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These  golf  balls  can turn a humdrum round of  golf  into  crazy
golf;  try the Cloud-Flite Exploder. This ball will go in the hole
alright,  but whether it comes out in one piece is another  matter
entirely.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Watch with glee the look of horror on  your  partner's
face  as he makes it a perfect hole in one,  only for the ball  to
explode in a massive cloud of smoke!  Cruel? Maybe a little -  but
we don't have a problem with that.</P>
