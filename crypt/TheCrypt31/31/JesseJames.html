<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Jesse  James</B>  full name is Jesse Woodson James.  He  was  born  in
Missouri,  of Reverend Robert and Zerelda James,  on September  5,
1847.  By the time Jesse was eight, his mother had remarried twice
more.  From the third marriage,  Jesse gained two stepbrothers and
two  stepsisters,  in addition to the two natural brothers he had.
He  was skilled with horses and a natural leader.  <B>He was never  a
very skilled marksman.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1861,  Jesses brother Frank left home to fight for the  rebel
cause.  Jesse wanted to join him, but it wasnt until 1863 when he
joined Quantrills raiders.  Quantrill didnt really want him, but
Bloody  Bill Anderson took Jesse under his wing.  Somehow  Jesse
acquired  the  nickname of Dingus.  He was part of  the  Centralia
massacre  in 1864.  He is also known to have been a  spy  for  the
rebel  army.  Jesse was wounded towards the end of the Civil  War.
He  took  a  bullet through one of his lungs.  His cousin  Zerelda
Mimms nursed him back to health. His recuperation was slow.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frank  and  Jesse  had  talked about  forming  a  gang  with  Cole
Younger,   but  Jesse was not with them when they committed  their
first  robbery  in February of 1866 at Liberty,  Missouri.   Jesse
didnt join them until October.  Frank and Cole Younger got  about
$57,000  from that job.  But it wasnt until March 1867 that  they
pulled  their first job together.  They tried to  rob  a  bank  at
Savannah.   All three aimed at the bank president,  but  all  were
poor  shots,   and only one bullet barely grazed  him.   This  job
failed.  Two months later a man and his fifteen-year-old son  were
found  dead,  thought to have been killed by Jesse.  He  was  very
attached  to  his mother and usually hid out at  her  house  after
pulling a job.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  March of 1868,  the James brothers and Younger brothers robbed
the banking house of Nimrod & Cin in Russellville,  Kentucky.   In
1869,  they robbed a Richmond,  Missouri Bank. That same year they
robbed the Daviess Savings Bank at Gallatin,  Missouri.  On  April
29,   1872,   five men,  including the James,  robbed  a  bank  in
Columbia, Kentucky.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jesse  is  thought  to be the mastermind behind  robbing  railroad
express cars.  Their first target was the Chicago and Rock  Island
express  near Adair,  Iowa,  on July 21,  1873.  They stopped  the
train  by  removing  a  portion of the track.   Jesse  killed  the
engineer during that robbery.  They got $2,000 from the  safe  and
the valuables of the passengers.  Two months later Frank and Jesse
stole  $10,000 from a Kansas City fairground.  By  that  time  the
Pinkertons were after them.  Pinkerton detective J. W. Whicher was
killed while pursuing the James brothers,  allegedly by Jesse  and
Frank. Pinkerton sent more agents after them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On January 31,  1874, they robbed the Iron Mountain Railroad train
in Wayne County,  Missouri.  While hiding out in Roscoe, Missouri,
the  Pinkertons caught John and Jim Younger.  During  the  gunplay
that  resulted in their capture,  John was shot in  the  neck  and
killed by Captain Louis J.  Lull of the Pinkertons.  This occurred
on March 17, 1874.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On January 25,  1875,  they laid siege to the Samuels home. James
and  Frank  got  away.  Sometime during the  shootout,   a  device
similar to a Molotov cocktail was thrown in the window,  where  it
hit  Mrs.  Zerelda Samuels,  which caused her to lose most of  her
right arm. Half-brother Archie was killed at nine years old.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three  months  later Jesse married his cousin  Zerelda,   after  a
courtship of nine years.  She always knew he was an outlaw. Others
had  asked  for  her  hand,   but she wanted  Jesse.   They  would
eventually have two children,  Mary and Jesse. Frank married Annie
Ralston  about the same time.  They eloped and her father  had  no
idea who she was married to.  It wasnt until a posse showed up at
the Ralston house that he realized who his daughter had married.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  following year,  a disastrous robbery attempt at  Northfield,
Minnesota,   resulted in many of those in the  James  gang  losing
their lives.  Unlike many of their previous escapades,  this  time
the  citizens fought back.  As they approached the bank,   several
citizens  thought they looked suspicious and alarmed the  sheriff.
The outlaws rode up and down the street firing randomly to try  to
get  people  to stay away while they robbed the bank.  Inside  the
bank,  the three tellers resisted handing over the money. One even
escaped  out the bank.  Outside many were fighting the other  gang
members.  The owner of a nearby hardware store killed gang  member
William Stiles.  Henry M.  Wheeler, a medical student, killed Clel
Miller.  He also wounded Bob Younger.  The remaining robbers  rode
away, getting absolutely nothing for their efforts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hundreds of volunteers joined posses to go after the gang.  Stiles
was  most familiar with the territory and he was dead.  They  were
also short on horses.  Two men had to share one horse.  They  were
cornered at Medalia,  Minnesota,  where they shot their way out of
a gunfight.  During this fight, another gang member was killed and
three  more  were  wounded.    They   were  jailed  at  Faribault,
Minnesota.   They  pled   guilty   and   were  sentenced  to  life
imprisonment  at Stillwater State Penitentiary.  Jesse  and  Frank
made  good their escape,  but had to lay low for over three years.
Jesse  lived under the name of Howard during this time.   He  kept
moving  and  took  up residence across the country  in  Tennessee,
California,  and Colorado.  For awhile he worked a rich strike  in
California Gulch in Colorado with Frank and the Ford brothers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  October 1879,  he was back to his old tricks with a new  gang.
They  robbed  a  Chicago and Alton train.  They robbed  four  more
trains in 1881,  the last one at Glendale,  Missouri. Two of their
gang  members were captured after that one.  After that the  James
gang was never heard from again.  Jesse was killed by Bob Ford,  a
gang member,  on April 3,  1882,  reportedly for the reward money.
They  made  sure it was really him by identifying war time  wounds
on  his  body.  After Jesse was killed his guns and  gunbelt  were
auctioned  off  for  fifteen dollars.  He had  owned  a  Colt  .45
Peacemaker  and  a  .45  Smith and Wesson  Schofield.   For  years
afterward,  Jesses mother sold many other guns claiming that they
belonged to Jesse.  They were obviously old relics she  bought  by
the dozens to sell at outrageous prices.  Frank turned himself  in
after Jesses death. However, he was never convicted of anything.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  a  long time there were rumors that Ford did not kill  Jesse,
that  it  was somewhere else.  Jesse was thought to be  living  in
Guthrie,   Oklahoma as late as 1948 and that he died at  Granbury,
Texas.   The real recipient of Fords bullet,  claim some stories,
was  a  crook  named Bigelow,  reported to have been  living  with
Jesses wife at the time.</P>
