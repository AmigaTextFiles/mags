<P ALIGN="LEFT">A women desperately looking for work goes into a toy factory.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Personnel Manager goes over her resume and explains to her that he
regrets he has nothing worthy of her.&nbsp; The woman answers that she really
needs work and will take almost anything.&nbsp; The Personnel Manager hems and
haws and finally says he does have a low skill job on the Tickle-Me-Elmo
line and nothing else.&nbsp; The woman happily accepts..&nbsp; He takes her down to the
line and explains her duties and that she should come in at 8am the next day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day at 8:45 there's a knock at the Personnel Manager's door.&nbsp; The
Tickle-Me-Elmo line manager comes in and starts ranting about the woman just
hired.&nbsp; After screaming for 15 minutes about how badly backed up the assembly
line is, the Personnel Manager suggested he be shown the problem.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together they head down to the line and sure enough Elmos are backed up from
here to kingdom come.&nbsp; Right at the end of the line is the woman just hired.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She has pulled over a roll of the material used for the Elmos and has a big
bag of marbles.&nbsp; They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric and
takes 2 marbles and starts sewing them between Elmo's legs.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Personnel Manager starts to kill himself laughing and finally after 20
minutes of rolling around,&nbsp; he pulls himself together and walks over to the
new employee and says,&nbsp; "<B>I'm sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What I wanted you to do was give Elmo two test tickles."</B></P>
