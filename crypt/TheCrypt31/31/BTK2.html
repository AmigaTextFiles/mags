<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The young Kid Antrim headed for Lincoln County as  a
member  of  the  rough  gang led by Jesse  Evans.   Shortly  after
arriving,   the  gang  became allies for the  county's  dominating
force:   the L.G.  Murphy & Dolan Co.  and just in time,   because
tensions  were  building   between   the  company  and  their  new
competition,   John  Tunstall.  Despite early  history  books  and
movies,  the Lincoln County War was not a range war.  It was built
up  by  numerous  feuds that had erupted involving  other  parties
since  the  late  1860s.  But the bitter feud  between  Englishman
John  Tunstall,   against Irishman J.J.   Dolan  caused  the  most
notoriety and bloodshed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both  men had one objective,  to form a monopoly  in  Lincoln
County.  But the Murphy & Dolan Co.  had already established their
enterprise,   and they had the Santa Fe Ring,  the county  sheriff
and now the "Boys" backing them up.  James Dolan was L.G. Murphy's
protégé  and   with Murphy's money and connections  with  powerful
men  in  New  Mexico,   he  became head of the  faction.   Murphy,
meanwhile  was in Santa Fe dying of cancer.  John Tunstall  was  a
young  cocky  newcomer who had a get-rich-quick  scheme,   and  he
learned  quickly  on how to go about it.  He  wrote  home  to  his
father about his plan:</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I><B>"Everything in New Mexico that pays at all (you may  say)   is
worked  by  a  `ring' there is the `indian ring' `the  army  ring'
`the  political ring' `the legal ring' `the Roman  Catholic  ring'
`the  cattle  ring'  `the horse thieves ring'  and  half  a  dozen
rings.  It is necessary either to get into a ring or make one  for
yourself.  I am at present at work making a ring." He goes  on  to
write,  "I propose to confine my operations to Lincoln County, but
I  intend  to  handle it in such a way,  as to get half  of  every
dollar that is made in the county by anyone."</B></I></P>

Tunstall  was not exactly the honest man struggling  to  start
his own business in a corrupt town,  but he too,  was as greedy as
Dolan  and  wanted to form a monopoly.  It was only the difference
between  who  was bad and worse.  So with his father's  money  and
taking on attorney Alex McSween as partner,  Tunstall started  his
own  ranch  and town store,  and  became a thorn in Dolan's  side.<BR>
<B>Big mistake.</B> <BR> 
<BR>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dolan  was already having financial problems and on the  verge
of  going  bankrupt.  Now with Tunstall's competition and  gaining
support from the locals and from cattle baron John Chisum,  it was
creating  a  huge  problem.  Dolan lashed out by  getting  McSween
arrested on phony embezzlement charges and having Jesse Evans  and
his gang steal horses from Tunstall's ranch.  Tunstall struck back
by  exploiting Sheriff Brady for default in tax collecting in  the
editorial of the Independent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile,  the Boys were getting a bit much even for the Kid,
and  at one point he separated himself from the gang and met  some
of  the  locals,  such as the Jones family and two cousins,  Frank
and  George  Coe.   The Kid's relationship with  Jesse  Evans  was
getting  rocky and some members of the gang didn't like  having  a
kid  tagging  along,  particularly Bill Morton,  who  bullied  and
kicked  the Kid out of camp one evening.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the story goes,   the
Kid  was  getting too friendly with Morton's girl.  The  Kid  then
bounced  back and forth from the Boys and who knows where,   until
he  was  arrested and charged with the theft of Tunstall's horses,
and  thrown in the town jail,  which was nothing more then a  hole
in  the ground.  Because of his lack of involvement with the gang,
it's  often  speculated whether he was even with the  Boys  during
the theft; he may have been at the Jones Ranch.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Tunstall knew the Kid was a member of Evans's gang,   but
if he won the Kid over and hired him,  he could use him as witness
against  the rustlers. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid knew he was no longer welcomed  by
the  gang and had nowhere else to go,  so he took Tunstall  up  on
his  offer.   The Kid was released from jail and  hired  on  as  a
Tunstall employee.  The 17-year-old teenager hoped this was a  new
beginning for him,  so he was now going by a new name,  <B>William H.
Bonney.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  vagabond youth,  who had no place to fit  in  since  his
mother died,  now finally found his niche.  He was welcomed aboard
and  immediately clicked with his new friends.  George  Coe  would
later  remember,   <B>"He  was the center of interest  everywhere  he
went,   and  though heavily armed,  he seemed  as  gentlemanly  as
college-bred  youth.  He quickly became acquainted with  everyone,
and because of his humorous and pleasing personality grew to be  a
community favorite."</B> George's cousin Frank,  would also  remember,
<B>"He  was  about  seventeen,  5ft 8in,   weight  138lbs  and  stood
straight as an Indian,  fine looking lad as ever I met.  He was  a
lady's  man  and the Mexican girls were all crazy about  him.   He
spoke  their language well.  He was a fine dancer,  could  go  all
their gaits and was one of them.  He was a wonder,  you would have
been proud to know him."</B></P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dolan was getting frustrated. He was doing everything in his power to get rid of John Tunstall, by bad-mouthing him, threatening him (even pointing a gun in his face), rustling his livestock and the sheriff levying his property for McSween's debts, who was just released on bond. But it still wasn't driving the Englishman away. Tunstall knew his rights, and it made him more determined to fight back. Unfortunately, Tunstall's stubbornness and holding out would cost him dearly, including all of those around him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 18, 1878, Sheriff Brady sent Deputy Bill Mathews and a posse to Tunstall's ranch to attach the cattle in the case of McSween. Tunstall would allow them to take the cattle, but not his horses. So Tunstall, and a handful of his men herded the horses to Lincoln. Upon arriving at Tunstall's ranch, Deputy Mathews formed a sub-posse led by Bill Morton to go after Tunstall and the horses. Among the posse, there were Jesse Evans, Tom Hill, Frank Baker, George Hindmann and several more. Ironically, half the men who rode with the posse were members of the Boys and were wanted outlaws.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the afternoon, the Tunstall group rode towards a canyon. The Kid and John Middleton rode drag about 300 yards behind pushing the horses, while Tunstall, Brewer, and Rob Widenmann led the way. A flock of wild turkeys got the attention of Brewer and Widenmann. Pulling out their rifles, they loped after them, leaving Tunstall alone. Suddenly, the Kid saw the posse galloping towards. While the Kid spurred his horse forward to warn Brewer and Widenmann, Middleton rode towards Tunstall and yelled out, "<B>For God's sake, follow me!</B>" as he and the others all headed for cover behind some rocks. "<B>What John.what?</B>" was Tunstall's last words.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Tunstall was dead, shot down in cold-blood by Morton and his posse. The following day Brewer and the Kid swore out affidavits to Justice of the Peace J. Wilson, who then issued warrants for the assassins. Constable Martinez deputized the Kid and Fred Waite to aid in serving the warrants against the men, who were at Dolan's store. When they walked in, Sheriff Brady was present and refused to permit the arrest of his men. He then took the constable and his two deputies prisoner. The men cursed and abused then and confiscated their weapons, including a Winchester rifle Tunstall had given the Kid. After a couple of hours, only Martinez was free to go. The Kid and Fred Waite were released two days later, missing Tunstall's funeral, so the story of him swearing revenge over his employer's grave at the funeral is just part of his myth.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wilson then deputized Brewer, who formed his own posse; they would call themselves the "Regulators." The Kid would prove himself to very dependable solider due to his loyalty and fighting capabilities. Frustrated by the Sheriff Brady's interference and Governor Axtell turning a blind eye to what was going on in the county, the Regulators were going to fight fire with fire.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First,   Bill  Morton and Frank Baker  were  killed  (possibly
execution  style)   after surrendering  to  the  Regulators,   who
rightfully believed that if the prisoners were turned over to  the
sheriff,  they would be released.  During the killing,  they  also
killed  William  McCloskey,    who   was  on  friendly  terms  and
sympathetic towards Morton and Baker and who may also have been  a
spy.  Then six Regulators,  including the Kid, ambushed and killed
Sheriff Brady and his deputy George Hindmann.  The Kid would later
confess  to  Mrs.   McSween,  that he was aiming  at  Deputy  Bill
Mathews,  who narrowly escaped the shooting.  The Kid felt Mathews
was responsible for Tunstall's death,  by sending the sub-posse to
go  after Tunstall.  But instead,  Mathews got the last word  when
the Kid stepped out in the street to reclaim his rifle,  which lay
next to Brady's corpse;  leveling his rifle,  Matthews fired,  but
the bullet only clipped the Kid in the hip.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon  afterwards,  Buckshot Roberts,  a  Dolan  gunman,   fell
victim,   but  not before he killed Dick Brewer  and  wounded  two
others.   The Kid was even grazed in the arm by a bullet.   Though
Charlie  Bowdre gave Roberts his fatal wound,  the  Kid  would  be
blamed for it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  it was Murphy and Dolan's turn,  with the help of Colonel
Dudley  and  the  Fort   Stanton   Army.    The  Kid  and  several
Regulators,  along with Alex McSween,  were trapped and surrounded
in  McSween's  home in Lincoln by Dolan's men  and  army  troops. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  a five-day siege,  the house was set on fire.  Alex McSween
fell in despair,  and the other men started to panic.  The Kid, up
until that point,  was a follower,  but now he stepped forward and
took leadership.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plan was that he and four others would  make
a  break  out  the  back  door  and run towards  Tunstall's  store
through a gate on the east side of the wall,  drawing the line  of
fire to them.  Meanwhile,  McSween and the others would run to the
rear wall,  through a back gate and lose themselves in the dark by
the river. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was  about 9 o'clock at night when they made their  move. 
The  Kid would recall the flames from the fire "<B>made it almost  as
light as day for a short distance around." </B> The Kid led his  group
towards  Tunstall's store as planned,  but  when  met  by  gunfire
coming  from the store,  they made a quick dash for the  river  to
meet  the others.  Meanwhile,  McSween and his group ran for their
lives  towards the back gate,  and they too received a  volley  of
bullets.  It was pure pandemonium,  guns blazing from  both  sides
and men falling dead or wounded.  When the smoke cleared,  it  was
over.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night,  on the Kid's side,  McSween and four others  were
dead.  Several others,  who were wounded,  managed to escaped.  On
the  Dolan  side,   Robert  Beckwith was  killed.   Following  the
aftermath,   the  victors got drunk and looted  Tunstall's  store,
while The Kid and the survivors slipped away into the darkness.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid  had hoped for a better future by joining  Tunstall's
side,   but now it was blowing away with the ashes from  McSween's
house.  The only future he had now, was to be the whipping boy for
this  senseless war.  Out of everyone who fought  in  the  Lincoln
County War,  the Kid would be the only punished.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>From here on out, he would be a wanted man.</B></P>
