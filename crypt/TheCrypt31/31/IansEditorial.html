<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The<FONT COLOR=RED> <B>CRYPT 31</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER> -<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> The Gunslingers<FONT COLOR=SILVER>,&nbsp; Well I have had fun doing this
Issue.&nbsp; As a child growing up, Cowboys were my hero's, Hardly
surprising when you consider almost every second Film, TV Series
and Book was/or had a western theme.</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what of the gunslingers?&nbsp; Those men who bravely lived by the
speed of their guns.&nbsp; Facing each other across a dusty street,
hands poised over leather holsters, waiting for the final tick of
the town clock.&nbsp; To live or die by the speed of your handgun.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly none of this is true, most Gunslingers never faced up 
    to others in a straight draw.&nbsp; One however did have the honour of being 
    the fastest gun, I will leave you to find that out for yourselves, but beware 
    of the <B>Dying Dentist</B>.</P>
