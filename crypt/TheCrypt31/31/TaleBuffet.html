<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having settled nicely into life as the catering storeman, I had
developed my own system of working, and things were ticking over
well  .. Or so I thought.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One morning Mr. Pollock arrived in the store and slammed a large
cardboard box down on the Counter.&nbsp; I could tell my his expression
he was not pleased.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>IAN ..What the hell is this</B>" &nbsp; he said pointing to the box on the
counter.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I looked in the box, Which had been delivered earlier that morning
from the local Fish supplier, Looking at Bills expression I
decided that replying "<B>FISH</B>" would not be the best idea.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Pollock lifted one of the Haddock  and held it up in
front of my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; It resembled a badly filleted Sardine. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>You of all people should know that we get 3 fillets to the Pound,
We can't serve this shite to our Customers! ... Why did you accept
it?</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My defence that the Fish was delivered directly to the Cafeteria,
and I only signed the delivery slip was insufficient to quell his
wrath.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>YOU</B>&nbsp; <B>Sign the Bloody thing ..Your responsible ..Take this box back
to the Fishmonger and tell him if this is the best he can do,
We'll get our orders from somewhere else in future</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Pollock stormed off, Leaving me well and truly Verbally "ass
kicked."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I felt really angry as I put on my Jacket and carrying the 12lbs
of fish headed for the Fishmongers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the shop I asked to speak to the Manager. We don't have a
manager the "Serving Wench" replied.&nbsp; The Owner is in the office.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was lead into this small office where I met the Shop Owner, But I
still felt angry that Mr. Pollock had been unjust in his criticism
of me and this Guy was going to get a piece of my mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After slating the condition of the Fish that had been delivered
that Morning, I threatened to take my order to another shop.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The shop owner face went quite pale at this, After all the Railway
order was quite a large portion of his daily business, and he
certainly didn't want to lose the contract.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apologies were made and assurances given that the fish would 
    be replaced, It calmed me down a little, But as a parting gesture I told him 
    that in future all deliveries would be to me, and they would be checked, Prior 
    to acceptance, Any further problems and I would get a fresh supplier.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dread to think what was said in the shop after i had left, But
true to his word, around 15 minutes after I had returned to the
store, The fishmongers Delivery boy arrived and nervously placed
the box of fish on the counter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I checked the fish and this time they looked beautiful, Rich, plump
pieces of Haddock.&nbsp; I signed the delivery slip and handed it back
to the frightened delivery boy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After stuffing the slip in his pocket, he bent down and placed a
carrier bag on the Store counter&nbsp; "<B>My boss says give this to you</B>"&nbsp;
then he fled like a scalded cat out of the store and peddled his
bike down the road.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Slightly puzzled and wary I opened the bag, and the Package it
contained.&nbsp; 4 Lovely Salmon steaks lay within.&nbsp; I checked the
delivery note again ...Yup the Haddock was there but no mention of
Salmon.&nbsp; Then it struck me ...<B>A BRIBE</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the morning I puzzled over what to do about this,
Eventually deciding that honesty was the best policy, So picking
up the steaks I headed for Bill Pollocks office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After explaining to Mr. Pollock about the events of the Morning
Visit and the unexpected present, He smiled and said &nbsp;"<B>You must
have scare the Crap out of him</B>".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I asked what I should do with the Salmon,&nbsp; "<B>Well ..If I was you I'd
phone the wife and tell her to put the sausages back in the
fridge, and have the salmon for your tea tonight</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I offered to share the fish with Mr. Pollock, an offer nicely
refused, and providing an item was not recorded on the delivery
notes, He said he didn't care what happened to them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However before I left his office, He did remind me that although I
placed and received the Orders, Never to forget other people sold
them.&nbsp; (Or in other words, don't get to greedy and keep others in mind)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>I dined well that night.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the space of the next week or so, Visits were made to the
Butchers and the Grocers where we ordered veg. and Steak/Sausages
etc. On each occasion the shops were privately owned and after my
visits, A "Present" was delivered at least once a week.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to admit, at first I felt rather guilty about this, But
quickly dispelled any regrets by accepting that this was part and
parcel of being a storeman.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course most Items going through the stores didn't come from
small owner shopkeepers, but rather from multinational companies.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I still dealt with the Sales reps and placed the relevant orders.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A month or so on from the Fish shop problem, a Whisky sales rep
arrived at the store.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  I have to admit,&nbsp;  I wasn't keen on this guy, &nbsp; He was a rather
gloomy person and the Brand that he represented was not one of the
better sellers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So I told him I didn't need an order this month as I had just
received a large delivery of whisky that morning.</P>

The Sales Rep leaned forward and in a low voice said&nbsp; "<B>We have a
special offer on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order 3 cases of anything and we will give you a
free bottle for yourself</B>"

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I looked at the salesman and asked "Will the bottle come with the
delivery and will it be on the documents?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>NO ...You place your order now and I'll go and get the bottle
from my car</B>".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I quickly scribbled out an order for 6 cases, and the rep
disappeared to get me 2 bottles of Whisky.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The rest of my afternoon was taken up by trying to work out how to
shift 6 cases of this unpopular brand. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Fortunately I was working in the Bar part time and was on duty that
very evening.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However the head barmaid was a very honest person, and not even a
drop of lemonade was taken by her without money going into the
till. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The station bar was open until 10 pm in these days, and the Head
Barmaids husband always appeared and helped us tidy up...And then
ran us home.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the bar had closed, I spoke to the Barmaid and her husband,
and suggested that we put more of this certain brand on optic, And
when Customers asked for a Whisky we served this brand.&nbsp; The
barmaid was unsure, but the present of a bottle to her husband,
and the promise of a regular supply (which was all above board)
swayed her thinking.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well between the Bar and the Orders from the Restaurant cars, It
didn't take long to shift the 6 cases.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next time a Whisky Rep appeared looking for an Order, he was
refused, I would explain one of his competitors had a special deal
on and I was ordering from them. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Legalised begging?</B> ...Perhaps ..But it worked.&nbsp; Most reps realised
that crossing the palm with liquid would secure them an order, And
myself and the Barmaid had a fruitful relationship.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By now it was coming to very near the end of the year.&nbsp; Mr. Pollock
dragged me into his office and reminded me that the "Staff"
Christmas party would be held in a month or so.&nbsp; He clearly
expected the Companies that supplied us throughout the Year to
Give generously.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So The Ferret embarked on a mission to get goods for the Christmas
party. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">No one was safe ...Reps/Owner/Manager were left in no doubt that
IF they wanted they retain their contracts for next year, They
should enter into the Christmas Spirit.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The goods flowed in.&nbsp;Turkey/Smoked Salmon/Veg. and even 
    a couple of cases of Champagne along with the Beer and Spirits I collected.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The day of the Christmas party, I was rather embarrassed when Bill
Pollock asked the Staff to "<B>Put their hands together</B>" and thank
The Storeman for all his efforts.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was so much food and drink available that not only did
everyone eat and drink their fill, But sufficient was left to ensure
everyone went home with a carrier bag of goodies.</P>
