 <CENTER>It was our High School reunion -</CENTER>
<CENTER>My gawd the years fly quick -</CENTER>
<CENTER>An old memory walked through the door,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And he was lookin' kinda sick.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>I'd studied the old yearbook</CENTER>
<CENTER>Memorizing each forgotten name.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Could it be? Nawh! It must be him.</CENTER>
<CENTER>There he was, my teenage flame.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>Oh, he was a handsome devil then,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Cocky, bold and strong</CENTER>
<CENTER>A junior rodeo champion,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Oh my gawd we got along.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>But I went on to college,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Missed him less and less each day.</CENTER>
<CENTER>While he took the rodeo circuit -</CENTER>
<CENTER>Rode rough stock in the P.R.C.A.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>Now twenty years later there he stood</CENTER>
<CENTER>Lookin' twice as old as most</CENTER>
<CENTER>A bent up man in a bent up body </CENTER>
<CENTER>That could be giving up the ghost.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>He told me I was lookin' good,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As he flashed a toothless grin.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I wished I could say the same.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I blurted, "You stayed thin."</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>His left eye was kinda droopy,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And the right one wore a patch.</CENTER>
<CENTER>His nose faced northeast when he faced north,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And his ears no longer matched.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>One elbow didn't bend quite right,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And that shoulder rather sagged.</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I asked him how he'd been I couldn't tell</CENTER>
<CENTER>if he bellyached or bragged.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>He said, "Every rib's been busted,</CENTER>
<CENTER>An' my skull's been fractured twice.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Let's sit down while we talk,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'm s'posed to keep this knee on ice.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>"I split my spleen in Abilene,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Broke my elbow up in Pasco,</CENTER>
<CENTER>My collar bone in San Antone</CENTER>
<CENTER>Crushed each toe in old El Paso.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>"I broke my jaw in Wichita,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Lost six more teeth in Tacoma </CENTER>
<CENTER>Then in Medford, man I was gored</CENTER>
<CENTER>And spent three months in a coma.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>"I don't let 'em know I'm hurtin' so</CENTER>
<CENTER>(A cowboy ain't supposed to complain)</CENTER>
<CENTER>But my muscles cramp when the weather's damp</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or when someone even mentions rain.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>He said, "Heck," as he cracked his neck,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"You know, I'm still decidin',</CENTER>
<CENTER>But it may be true, in a year or two,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I just might give up bull ridin'." ---</CENTER>
