<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you bought a new computer and would like to donate or sell the old 
one.  How can you erase all personal information, such as bank account numbers, 
credit card numbers and other information that you put in when you did your online 
banking and from when you shopped on the Internet?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The quickest way to do this is to use the restore disk that came with the 
computer when you purchased it  most computer companies give you one in the box 
the computer came in. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the restore process, you will be given the option of erasing the hard 
drive  that's the one that you would want to choose.  If you don't have a 
restore disk, you can use the original Windows disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you don't know how to do this, most computer repair businesses can easily 
do this process for you, for a nonimal fee.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Concider it money well spent, and <B>DO NOT</B> recycle you old computer without erasing your personal Data.</P>
