<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was December 18,  1880. For a short time Billy the Kid led
Pat  Garrett  on  a cat and mouse game,  but finally  the  sheriff
caught  up with the Kid in Fort Sumner.  Garrett was at  the  Fort
looking for the Kid,  but the Kid wasn't there;  he was hiding out
at  a nearby ranch owned by Tom Wilcox and Manuel Brazil.  The Kid
then  received  a  note  from a Fort Sumner resident  saying  that
Garrett  and his posse had left and were heading south to Roswell.
The  Kid  and  his gang mounted up and made the cold ride  through
the snow to Fort Sumner.  What the Kid didn't know was that he was
riding into a trap;  Garrett himself sent the phony note,  and was
waiting  in the shadows of the old Military hospital for  the  Kid
to make his appearance.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  the  Kid  and  his gang,  which consisted  of  four  (Dave
Rudabaugh,  Tom O'Folliard,  Billy Wilson and Tom Pickett,)   rode
towards  the hospital,  Garrett whispered,  "That's them"  to  his
men  and  they opened fire.  The lawmen thought the rider  leading
the  way  was  the Kid and aimed for him,  but it was  O'Folliard;
shot  in  the  chest,  he keeled over in his saddle,   and  didn't
follow  when  the Kid and the others rode hell bound  for  leather
into  the fog.  It wasn't much use to pursue the Kid in  the  dark
and snowy weather,  so the lawmen carried O'Folliard inside a room
in the old hospital and laid him down on the floor,  while the men
played  a  game of poker.  Tom O'Folliard,  Billy the  Kid's  best
friend with whom he shared many adventures with, died.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid and his friends rode back to Wilcox/Brazil's ranch and
got  their wits back,  ate a hot meal and then departed.  The  cat
and  mouse game resumed for another three days,  until  one  night
when  Garrett  tracked  the  Kid to  a  stone  house  in  Stinking
Springs.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  lawmen  waited till dawn,   and  then  they  heard
movement  and  voices coming from inside the house.  Garrett  then
instructed his men that when the Kid appeared,  they were to  open
fire  and  kill him.  Suddenly,  a figure came out of  the  house.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garrett recognized the wide brim hat the Kid always wore and  told
his men to shoot.  Once again,  like the night at Fort Sumner, the
men  shot  the  wrong man.  This time it was Charlie Bowdre.   The
wounded man wheeled back into the house,  then after a few minutes
later,  Wilson yelled out that Bowdre was dying and wanted to come
out.  When Bowdre staggered from the house,  he walked towards the
men and collapsed dead in the snow.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outlaws refused to surrender and even attempted to escape.
Garrett noticed one of the horses was being reeled in through  the
door.  The Kid's plan was for them to get mounted on their horses,
make  a burst through the door and take their chance.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sheriff
knew  what  he  was  up to and shot the horse  dead,   which  then
blocked the doorway.  Now the men were really trapped. After their
attempted escape,  there was a standoff, but by the afternoon, the
hungry  outlaws couldn't resist the smell of food the lawmen  were
cooking  over a roaring fire.  The starving and cold outlaws  then
gave themselves up.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a hearty meal,  the lawmen and their prisoners packed  up
and  headed back to Wilcox/Brazil's ranch,  where they  spent  the
night.   The  next morning they headed out to Fort Sumner,   where
Garrett  delivered the body of Charlie Bowdre to  his  wife,   who
went into hysterics and attacked the men. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prisoners were then
taken  to the blacksmith to be shackled.  During this brief  stay,
the  Kid  gave  his most prized possessions to posse  members  Jim
East  and Frank Stewart,  with whom he became friendly with  after
his  capture:  to East he gave his Winchester rifle.   But  later,
saloon  owner Beaver Smith had such a fit,  saying  the  Kid  owed
him,   that East reluctantly gave the rifle to him.  The Kid  then
gave  Stewart his beloved mare,  said to be the fastest  horse  in
the  territory.   (But  there  is another  version  to  the  story
concerning the Kid's horse.  The mare may have been confiscated by
Garrett,   who  then  gave  it to Stewart  for  helping  with  the
capture,  which may explain later why the Kid try to file suit  to
get the mare back).</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next morning,  the prisoners were loaded onto a wagon  and
headed out for Las Vegas.  On December 26,  the posse arrived  and
were  greeted by curious onlookers who wanted to catch  a  glimpse
of  the famous outlaw,  "<B>Billy the Kid." </B>At the jail,  the Kid and
the other prisoners were treated to new clothes;  the Kid was said
to  be in good spirits,  playing to the crowd and chatting with  a
reporter.  Then he was put in a jail, described by the reporter as
 <B>"a little hole in the wall," </B>for the night.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  next  morning,  the prisoners were hustled to  the  train
depot,  where they encountered a mob that was after Rudabaugh  (he
had  killed a Las Vegas jailer several months earlier).   But  all
ended  well,  and the train left without incident.   At  the  next
stop,   Santa Fe,  the prisoners were taken to the city  jail  and
locked up.  Garrett was through with his obligations and left  for
Lincoln County.</P>



   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the moment he was captured,  the Kid's mind was working on
saving  his  neck.  He would try to do it through attorneys,   the
governor and escaping;  but first he tried to escape.  The Kid and
his  cohorts  tried to dig their way through  the  dirt  floor  of
their  cell,   but the guards found the hole and  separated  them.
Unfortunately,  the Kid got the worst of it; he was chained like a
circus elephant and locked in a dark tiny solitary cell.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next,  he tried an attorney,  Ira Leonard,  who visited the Kid
in  jail but lost interest in helping him at that time and  didn't
come  back  till  weeks  later.  The Kid  then  tried  Rudabaugh's
attorney,   Edgar Caylpless,  but the attorney wouldn't  represent
him for free,  so the Kid offered him his horse, which Stewart now
owned;   which meant the attorney would have to file  a  suit  for
ownership of the mare.  Caylpless too,  lost interest in the Kid's
case.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid  then  took pencil and paper,  and wrote  letters  to
Governor Wallace,  reminding him of his promise.  The Kid  did  in
fact stick to his end of the bargain (not to mention,  putting his
life at peril),  but the governor didn't come through on his.  Now
it  was too late.  The governor would never pardon Billy the  Kid,
who had become too famous.  The Kid was running out of options. He
couldn't depend on any one else but himself,  and focused  on  one
thing-escape.</P>



   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On March 28,  1881, the Kid was removed from the Santa Fe jail,
and  taken by train to Mesilla,  where he was to be tried for  the
killing of Sheriff Brady and Buckshot Roberts.  When the  Kid  and
the  lawmen  arrived at Rincon,  just hours away from Mesilla  (by
coach),  a mob confronted them.  It is unknown whether the mob was
hostile towards the prisoner or wanted to free him.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  likely,
by  the description of the mood of the crowd,  it was probably  to
lynch him.  The lawmen told the Kid if the mob rushed them that he
would  be  shot  first  (so much for being innocent  until  proven
guilty  in  a  court of law,  here the lawmen were ready  to  make
their  own verdict).  The next morning the Kid was loaded  into  a
coach and made the trip to Mesilla, and arrived in one piece.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first trial began on March 30,  with the bias Judge Bristol
presiding  and attorney Ira Leonard appointed to defend  the  Kid.
The first case was the killing of Buckshot Roberts,  which Leonard
was  able  to get thrown out,  stating that the murder took  place
not on federal land,  but private.  Therefore,  the government had
no jurisdiction.  But the prosecution didn't care much;  they knew
the Kid would be found guilty for the murder of Brady.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  following day,  the Kid was tried for the  death  of  the
Lincoln County Sheriff,  William Brady.  Even though the  Kid  was
one  of  six involved in the shooting of the sheriff,  he was  the
only  one  to be indicted,  and placed on trial.  The  Kid  didn't
stand  a  chance in this courtroom.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The judge dismissed  attorney
Leonard,   because he was doing too good of a  job  defending  the
Kid,  and replaced him with two unprepared attorneys,  who had  no
sympathy for their client,  John D.  Bail and Albert Fountain (who
was  a  supporter of the Santa Fe Ring and hated rustlers).  Also,
there  were  prejudice  witnesses   testifying  against  the  Kid,
including  Bill Mathews,  one of those responsible for  Tunstall's
death,  but yet,  the Kid had no witnesses summoned to testify  in
his behalf.  Then the judge put the final nail in his coffin,   by
telling the jury:</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I><B>"If  he  was  present,   encouraging,  inciting,   aiding  in,
abetting,  advising, or commanding this killing of Brady, he is as
much  guilty as though he fired the fatal shot.  As  to  you  what
would  or would not be a reasonable doubt of guilt,  I charge  you
that  belief  in the guilt of this defendant to the  exclusion  of
every  reasonable doubt does require you to so believe  absolutely
and to a mathematical certainly.  That is, to justify a verdict of
guilty  it  is  not  necessary for you to  be  certain  that  this
defendant  is  guilty as you are that 2+2= 4.   Merely,   a  vague
conjecture  or  a  bare  possibility that  the  defendant  may  be
innocent  is  not sufficient to cause a reasonable  doubt  of  his
guilt."</B></I></P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  plain English,  <B>"if you do not find the defendant  guilty,
you're  all a bunch of idiots!"</B> and that's exactly what they  did.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  April 13,  the Kid was brought before the judge and was  asked
if  he  had  anything to say.  The Kid said no.   The  judge  then
sentenced the Kid to death on May 13,  1881 between the hours of 9
am  and  3  pm.   He would be taken to Lincoln for  execution  and
hanged  <B>"by the neck until his body be dead."</B> But the  Kid  wasn't
about to give up just yet;  his new attorney, Albert Fountain, was
willing  to  appeal the case if the Kid could bear  his  expenses.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  the  Kid  returned  to  his cell,   he  wrote  a  letter  to
Rudabaugh's  attorney,  Edgar Caypless,  about the  suit  for  his
horse.  If he could regain possession,  he would sell her and have
money  for attorney fees.  Unfortunately,  Caypless didn't  follow
through.   The Kid's only hope now was his cunning  abilities  and
lots of luck.</P>
