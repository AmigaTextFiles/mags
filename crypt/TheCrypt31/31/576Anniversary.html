<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">September 13th marks the 50th anniversary of 576's move into its present
display space in Centennial Park, Nashville Tennessee.  Here's an
opportunity for a memorable event for all steam fans in general and NC&StL
fans in particular to join in on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hopefully the short notice will not prevent you from joining a group of
people who wish to remember this date being in personal attendance. I for
one would only miss it in the direst emergency and will drive a thousand
miles to do it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NC&StL Preservation Society members are planning an informal "bring your
own" picnic and a display of railroad artifacts (primarily NC) and a
collection of models right next to 576 there on the grounds of Centennial
Park. The idea is to have a display of a "working" 576 model so that
non-railroad visitors can actually see what 576 would look like when
restored.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We've lucked out to be able to reserve the pavilion next to 576 as shelter
from rain or sun.  The cost of the pavilion is only $100 to us, NCPS. 
Perhaps you'd be willing to donate a little bit to cause to help cover this
cost.Things will start around 10 AM, and we expect to wind it down sometime
around 2PM. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's possible that there will be some media coverage of the event. Space in
the pavilion will be first come, first served, and all Metro Park rules
will be in effect...no selling or soliciting, no alcohol, you clean up
after yourself etc. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Though NCPS has organized this, we accept no responsibility for the usual
disclaimer items.</P>
  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">See the NCPS web site <A HREF="http://www.NCPS-576.org">www.NCPS-576.org</A>  . We would like some idea how many
might be there so if you think you can make the 13th, just drop a note
saying "yes for the 13th" to <A HREF="mailto:ncps@mindspring.com">ncps@mindspring.com</A>  .  Already about 30
people have said "yes". With the paper's announcement, I'm sure there could
be many more. <B>Hope to see you there.</B></P>
