<P ALIGN="LEFT">As I lay on my bed, thinking about you, I feel this strong urge to
grab you and squeeze you, because I can't forget last night.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  came to me unexpectedly during the balmy and calm night,  and
what happened in my bed still leaves a tingling sensation in me.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  appeared   from   nowhere   and   shamelessly,   without  any
reservations,   you  laid  on   my   naked  body...you  sensed  my
indifference,  so you applied your hungry mouth to me without  any
guilt  or  humiliation,  and you drove me  near  crazy  while  you
drained me.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally I went to sleep.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today when I woke up, you were gone, I 
searched for 
you but to no avail, only the sheets bore witness to last night's 
events. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My body still bears faint marks of your enthusiastic ravishings, 
making it 
harder to forget you.</P>
