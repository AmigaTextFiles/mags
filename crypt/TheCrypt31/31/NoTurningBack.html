<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt we have all experienced this at sometime or another, while browsing the web.&nbsp; You have found an interesting site, full of helpful or curious links and you are having a great time exploring, When it happens.&nbsp; You click on a link, then on the "<B>Back</B>" Button on your browser and the same page reloads again ... In effect "<B>No turning Back</B>"&nbsp; you are stuck on this one page.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Infuriating isn't it?&nbsp; What is the solution? .. Well you could simply close your browser and start again, But lets face it that is very inconvinient.&nbsp; So what is exactly going on and what should <B>YOU</B> do about it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no way for you to stop this,  but your browser isn't to blame.&nbsp; The site's
designers  have hijacked your Back button to make  sure  you  stay
put. &nbsp;  Whenever  you  encounter a  site  like  this,   e-mail  the
Webmaster and explain why you won't be coming back.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can get around the problem in several ways,  though. &nbsp; You  can
right-click the Back button,  which brings up a menu  listing  the
sites that you visited during your current browsing session.&nbsp;  Move
the  mouse  down to the site you want to revisit  and  then  left-
click.&nbsp;  You can use the same technique with the Forward button  as
well.&nbsp;  Another way is to click Internet Explorer's History  button
and select your desired site from the list.&nbsp;  This method will take
longer, however.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Incidentally,  if you open more than one Internet Explorer window,
each  one maintains its own Back and Forward lists. &nbsp; This  can  be
extremely useful but can also be confusing. &nbsp; It pays to keep track
of  the IE windows you have open at any given time;  when you  hit
the Back button and you don't achieve the desired result,  you may
just be working in the wrong browser window.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For people interested the "Right Click on the Back button" Method also works in the New version of <B>IBrowse</B> the Amiga Web Browser.</P>
