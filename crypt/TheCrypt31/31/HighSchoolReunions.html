<CENTER>Every ten years, as summertime nears,</CENTER>
<CENTER>An announcement arrives in the mail,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A reunion is planned; it'll be really grand;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Make plans to attend without fail.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>I'll never forget the first time we met;</CENTER>
<CENTER>We tried so hard to impress.</CENTER>
<CENTER>We drove fancy cars, smoked big cigars,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And wore our most elegant dress.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>It was quite an affair; the whole class was there.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It was held at a fancy hotel.</CENTER>
<CENTER>We wined, and we dined, and we acted refined,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And everyone thought it was swell.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>The men all conversed about who had been first</CENTER>
<CENTER>To achieve great fortune and fame.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Meanwhile, their spouses described their fine houses</CENTER>
<CENTER>And how beautiful their children became.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>The homecoming queen, who once had been lean,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Now weighed in at one-ninety-six.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The jocks who were there had all lost their hair,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And the cheerleaders could no longer do kicks.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>No one had heard about the class nerd</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who'd guided a spacecraft to the moon;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or poor little Jane, who's always been plain;</CENTER>
<CENTER>She married a shipping tycoon.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>The boy we'd decreed "most apt to succeed"</CENTER>
<CENTER>Was serving ten years in the pen,</CENTER>
<CENTER>While the one voted "least" now was a priest;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Just shows you can be wrong now and then.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>They awarded a prize to one of the guys</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who seemed to have aged the least.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Another was given to the grad who had driven</CENTER>
<CENTER>The farthest to attend the feast.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>They took a class picture, a curious mixture</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of beehives, crew cuts and wide ties.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Tall, short, or skinny, the style was the mini;</CENTER>
<CENTER>You never saw so many thighs.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>At our next get-together, no one cared whether</CENTER>
<CENTER>They impressed their classmates or not.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The mood was informal, a whole lot more normal;</CENTER>
<CENTER>By this time we'd all gone to pot.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>It was held out-of-doors, at the lake shores;</CENTER>
<CENTER>We ate hamburgers, coleslaw, and beans.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then most of us lay around in the shade,</CENTER>
<CENTER>In our comfortable T-shirts and jeans.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>By the fortieth year, it was abundantly clear,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We were definitely over the hill.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Those who weren't dead had to crawl out of bed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And be home in time for their pill.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>And now I can't wait as they've set the date;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Our sixtieth is coming, I'm told.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It should be a ball, they've rented a hall</CENTER>
<CENTER>At the Shady Rest Home for the old.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Repairs have been made on my old hearing aid;</CENTER>
<CENTER>My pacemaker's been turned up on high.</CENTER>
<CENTER>My wheelchair is oiled, and my teeth have been boiled;</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I've bought a new wig and glass eye.</CENTER>

<CENTER>I'm feeling quite hearty; I'm ready to party,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'll dance until dawn's early light.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It'll be lots of fun; and I hope at least one</CENTER>
<CENTER>Other person can make it that night.</CENTER>
