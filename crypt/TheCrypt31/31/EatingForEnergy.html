managing your mood with food. </CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eating a good breakfast boosts your concentration and revs 
your energy, particularly in the morning when you may need it 
most.&nbsp; Without breakfast, you're more likely to make that second 
pot of coffee by mid-morning.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, keep your blood sugar on an even keel with 
complex carbohydrates. &nbsp;Avoid refined carbohydrates, such as white 
bread and white sugar.&nbsp; These have a high glycemic index, which 
can cause spikes and dips in your blood sugar levels.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right complex carbohydrates provide your brain and muscles 
with the steady flow of the energy they need.&nbsp; Grains are great 
sources of B vitamins, which aid in the metabolic production of 
energy.&nbsp; The best carb choices for breakfast are natural 
whole-grain breads and cereals.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the best breakfast, add a low-fat protein, such as yogurt, 
cottage cheese, or skim milk, and watch your fat intake as well 
as your meat consumption (meat takes more energy to digest).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Mid-morning snack</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turns out, snacking may not be such a bad idea.&nbsp; Eating every few 
hours helps your body use nutrients more efficiently.&nbsp; It 
stimulates your metabolism, keeps your blood sugar levels 
steady, reduces stress on your digestive system, and decreases 
hunger, which means you'll be less likely to overeat when 
mealtime finally rolls around.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're craving carbs, which many of us do at this time of day, 
choose whole-grain bread, cereal, or fruit. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fruits and vegetables deliver a low-fat, high-fiber 
alternative to the vending machine choices.&nbsp; Raw carrots 
and sugar snap peas, for example, provide a crisp, 
satisfying crunch and won't zap your energy. &nbsp;
Challenge yourself to eat at least five servings 
of fruits and vegetables each day.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For maximum energy throughout the day, avoid foods that 
are laden with simple sugars, such as cookies, pastries, 
candy bars, and sodas, which can bring on erratic blood 
sugar levels.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, try some lean protein (low-fat yogurt, cottage cheese or 
lean meat) to help tide you over until lunch.</P>

<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Lunch</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At midday, go light.&nbsp; Because a hefty helping of carbohydrates 
can increase the amount of seratonin in the brain and cause 
that sleepy feeling, focus on low-fat protein. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protein can actually raise energy levels by increasing 
brain chemicals called catecholamines.&nbsp; Eat a lunch of low-fat 
cheese, fish, lean meat, poultry, or tofu.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="LEFT"><U>Mid-afternoon snack</U></P></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choose something that will keep you satisfied until dinner. &nbsp;
A little bit of fat is fine.&nbsp; It gives those carbohydrates and 
proteins some staying power.&nbsp; My favorite? All-natural peanut 
butter and a few crackers.</P>

<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Before your work-out</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carbohydrates are fastest to digest and pack quick energy.&nbsp;
Add protein for staying power, but stay away from fats. &nbsp;
They can make you cramp.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Dinner</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda for the evening can dictate what you'll eat 
for dinner.&nbsp; Need to stay on overdrive for back-to-school 
night?&nbsp; Choose low-fat proteins.&nbsp; If you're in relax 
mode, indulge a little.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever's on the menu, remember the Pie Test.&nbsp; Envision 
your plate as a pie.&nbsp; Seventy-five percent of the pie 
should be filled with fruits, vegetables, and grains 
and 25 percent with other foods, such as diary 
products and meat.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Before bed</U></B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before turning in, a carbohydrate-rich snack can supply seratonin 
to help you fall asleep.&nbsp; But go easy.&nbsp; Too much food can reduce 
the quality of your sleep.</P>
