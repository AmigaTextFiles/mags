<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I got my rabies shot.&nbsp;  Actually, I got a free five-pack of rabies 
shots, and I was not even frothing at the mouth. &nbsp; I discovered 
that you do not have to froth to claim your very own rabies 
shots.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, Misplaced Bat stumbled into our house under the cover 
of night.&nbsp;  <B>Woohoo </B>- that was exciting! &nbsp; Until I learned that you 
can catch fatal rabies from a bat bite.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not that Misplaced Bat had rabies, mind you.&nbsp; He seemed quite 
normal, fluttering in sporadic circles by night and sleeping 
peacefully in a corner by day. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I have some great news. &nbsp; A bat does not need to be rabid when 
it bites for the government brain-trust to label it a threat.  </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually, the closest I came to getting bitten was when Misplaced 
Bat flew by my ear through an open doorway.&nbsp;  In theory, I could 
have caught rabies if his wings had been soaking in bat saliva, 
and if some saliva grabbed hold of my hair, and if I touched my 
hair and then touched my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <B>In theory.</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Isn't this great?</B>&nbsp; A rabid bat bite wins you free rabies shots 
even if it was not rabid and did not even bite you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Lady also won her free rabies shot.&nbsp;  (<B>Do I have 
connections, or what?</B>)&nbsp; Our toddler was asleep when I shut the 
door to keep Misplaced Bat out.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twenty minutes later, unable to locate the wacky night flyer, my 
wife opened the door to Little Lady's room.&nbsp;  Much to my 
embarrassment, Misplaced Bat was still fluttering in circles, 
keeping pace with the ceiling fan.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <B>I had locked him in!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you know that twenty minutes in the same room as a bat is 
enough to qualify for rabies shots? &nbsp; Misplaced Bat had been 
circling the room high above our peacefully sleeping angel. &nbsp; But 
on suspicion of having dipped low enough to touch our daughter, 
she won the rabies shot lottery.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the whimsical world of government a rabid bat bite is a risk 
even if the bat was not rabid, did not bite, and did not even 
touch anybody.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My lucky wife, now seven months pregnant, also won her free 
rabies shots. &nbsp; Guess how close she came to the bat?&nbsp;  She saw him 
curled up sleeping near the ceiling.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Viewing a non-rabid bat not bite or touch anybody is an official 
risk in government circles.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Consider this analogy:</B>&nbsp; if a mystery man walks up to you in the 
street, pulls out a gun and shoots you full of bullet holes, you 
have the right to sue him.&nbsp;  <B>OK</B>,&nbsp; your heirs have the right, but 
why get picky over minor details? </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What if Mystery Man's gun is not loaded? &nbsp; Do you still get to sue 
him for shooting you? </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What if he doesn't even have a gun?&nbsp; What if he just walks up to 
you?&nbsp;  <B>Can you sue?</B>  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What if he does not even walk up to you?&nbsp;  What if Mystery Man 
does not even notice you? &nbsp; <B>Can you still sue him?</B> </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Official Government Rabies Manual, the answer is 
a resounding &nbsp;"<B>Yes!</B>&nbsp;  And get your free rabies shots, while you're 
at it. -- especially if you happen to view him not noticing you." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I started wondering if I might catch rabies from the vaccine. &nbsp; 
There is such thing as being overprotective. &nbsp; It's nice to know 
the government cares about me, but aren't things getting just a 
wee bit out of hand when a guy like me scores a free rabies shot 
five-pack without even frothing at the mouth?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took my rabies shot because I just can't pass up a freebie - 
and on the off-chance that the government knows best. &nbsp; <B><I>Hey, it 
could happen.</I></B></P>
