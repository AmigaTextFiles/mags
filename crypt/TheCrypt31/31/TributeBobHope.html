<CENTER>I thought 'Deep Throat' was a movie about a giraffe. </CENTER> 
<BR>
 <CENTER>I love to go to Washington, if only to be nearer my money.</CENTER>  
<BR>
  <CENTER>I do benefits for all religions - I'd hate to blow the hereafter on 
a technicality.  </CENTER>
<BR>
  <CENTER>If you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If 
you work at it, it's golf.</CENTER>  
<BR>
 <CENTER>Zsa Zsa Gabor got married as a one-off, and it was so successful she 
turned it into a series. </CENTER> 
<BR>
<CENTER>When they asked Jack Benny to do something for the Actor's Orphanage - 
he shot both his parents and moved in.</CENTER>  
<BR>
<CENTER>My father told me all about the birds and the bees, the liar - I went 
steady with a woodpecker till I was twenty-one. </CENTER> 
<BR>
<CENTER>I grew up with six brothers. That's how I learned to dance -waiting 
for the bathroom.</CENTER>  
<BR>
<CENTER>A James Cagney love scene is one where he lets the other guy live. </CENTER>
