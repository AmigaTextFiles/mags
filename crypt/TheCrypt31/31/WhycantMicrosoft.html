<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is it that Microsoft wants you to buy its product but does 
not want you to open the plastic case that is welded around the 
cardboard box?  I believe that such packaging along with 
cockroaches will survive atomic disasters! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good luck finding any clue as to an easy way to open this fused 
bit of skin-tearing packaging.  I split my scissors trying to 
pry open the ends.  I ripped a fingernail attempting to wiggle 
into a miniscule space. I wedged in a letter opener to see if I 
could leverage any kind of muscle and rip that sucker open. I 
seriously thought of using a chain saw. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, in a fit of anger akin to the Hulk, I seized one small, 
dagger-like split in the plastic, held the plastic casing with 
the other hand and yanked with all my might. I cut my hand 
extricating the box from the opening I'd created.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And what does this hidebound, 81/2" x 11" x 2" box contain: a 
CD!  I trembled thinking it too would be wrapped in that plastic 
that yields to neither man nor woman.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thankfully, the innocuous little CD was without wrapper. Good 
thing. My scream would have reverberated in the hallowed halls 
of Bill Gate's Washington mansion.  It's pain enough to upgrade 
software without going through the physical machinations of 
opening a #$%^& box.  </P>
