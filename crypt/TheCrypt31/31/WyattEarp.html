<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wyatt  Earp  is  best  known as the fearless  frontier  lawman  of
Wichita and Dodge City,  Kansas,  and as principal survivor of the
Gunfight  at  the  OK  Corral. &nbsp; But the Marshall  Earp  of  legend
accounted  for  only about 5 years of Wyatt's  long  and  eventful
life.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wyatt  spent most of his years traveling and living in the deserts
of the Southwest with his four brothers Virgil,  Morgan, James and
Warren,   as  well  as his wife Josie.&nbsp;  His lifelong  passion  for
mining,  gambling and sports led him from one boomtown to  another
across the span of the western frontier and into the 20th century.&nbsp;
Wyatt  Berry Stapp Earp was born in Monmouth,  Illinois  on  March
19,  1848.&nbsp; In 1864 he moved with his parents to Colton, California
near  San  Bernardino,  where he was employed as  a  teamster  and
railroad  worker.&nbsp;  Wyatt returned east and married in  1870,   but
after  the  sudden death of his new bride,  he drifted the  Indian
Territory working as a buffalo hunter and stagecoach driver.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1875 he arrived in Wichita,  Kansas where he joined the police
force.&nbsp;  In 1876,  he moved to Dodge City, Kansas where he became a
faro  dealer at the at the famous Long Branch Saloon and assistant
marshal. &nbsp; It was here he met and became lifelong friends with  Bat
Masterson  and  Doc  Holliday,    as   well  as  establishing  his
reputation as a notable lawman and gambler.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving  Dodge City with his second wife in 1878,  Wyatt  traveled
to New Mexico and California,  working for a time as a Wells Fargo
agent.&nbsp;  In 1879 he assembled with his brothers and their wives  in
the new silver mining town of Tombstone, Arizona.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wyatt  planned  to  establish   a   stage  line  here,   but  upon
discovering that there were already two in town,  he acquired  the
gambling  concession at the Oriental Saloon. &nbsp; His  brother  Virgil
became  town  marshal,  while Morgan took a job  with  the  police
department. &nbsp;  It  was here that Wyatt met  his  third  wife  Josie
(Josephine Marcus Earp), who remained with him until his death.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  October 26,  1881,  a feud that had developed between the Earp
brothers  and  a gang led by Ike Clanton culminated  in  the  most
celebrated gunfight in western folklore -- the Gunfight at the  OK
Corral. &nbsp;  Three of the Clanton gang were killed,   while  Ike  and
another  wounded  member  escaped.&nbsp;  The  three  Earp  brothers  --
Virgil,   Wyatt  and  Morgan -- along with Doc Holliday  survived.&nbsp;
Both  Morgan  and  Virgil  were wounded,   and  Virgil  was  later
terminated as marshal for his role in the homicides.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  March,  1882 Morgan Earp was gunned down by unknown assassins.&nbsp;
Wyatt,   along with his brother Warren and some friends,  embarked
on  a  vendetta  during  which all four suspects  were  eventually
killed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  being  accused  of these murders,   Wyatt  and  Josie  fled
Arizona to Colorado.&nbsp;  Then made the rounds of western mining camps
over the next few years.&nbsp;  They turned up in Coeur d' Alene,  Idaho
and  in 1886,  settled briefly in booming San Diego,  where  Wyatt
gambled and invested in real estate and saloons.</P>





<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1897  Wyatt  and  Josie  headed for  Nome  Alaska  where  they
operated a saloon during the height of the Alaska Gold Rush.&nbsp;  They
returned  to  the  states in 1901 with an  estimated  $80,000  and
immediately headed for the gold strike in Tonopah,  Nevada,  where
his  saloon,   gambling  and mining interests  once  again  proved
profitable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thereafter,  Wyatt took up prospecting in earnest,  staking claims
just outside Death Valley and elsewhere in the Mojave Desert.&nbsp;   In
1906  he  discovered several veins that contained gold and  copper
near  Vidal,  California on the Colorado River and filed  numerous
claims there at the base of the Whipple Mountains.
</P>




<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wyatt  spent  the winters of his final years working these  claims
in  the  Mojave  Desert  and  living with  Josie  in  their  Vidal
cottage. &nbsp;  He  and  Josie  summered in Los  Angeles,   where  they
befriended  early Hollywood actors and lived off real  estate  and
mining investments.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Jan.  13, 1929 Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles at the age of 80.
Cowboy  actors  Tom  Mix  and William  S.   Hart  were  among  his
pallbearers.&nbsp;  Wyatt's cremated ashes were buried in Josie's family
plot  in  Colma,  California,  just south of San Francisco.   When
Josie  died in 1944 at the age of 75,  she was buried there beside
him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among his enduring legacies as frontiersman,  lawman,  gambler and
prospector,   a post office near his Mojave Desert  mining  claims
along  the  Colorado River on Route 62 bears the  name  --  "<B>Earp,
California 92242.</B>"</P>
