<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Home-brewed coffee and comfortable working clothes. These
are a couple of my favorite things about being self-employed.
<B>Benefits only home can provide.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, it's amazing how quickly a great cup of coffee turns
bitter when your work becomes a job. And those loose
fitting clothes? Supermodel tight when you start squirming
from job stress. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to work from home and succeed at it, then
there is one important question you must ask yourself:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Do you have the right attitude?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does your attitude reflect a commitment to creating the
lifestyle you desire? Are you ready to move beyond the
dreaming stage into the doing stage?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key word here is <B>do</B>. You must have the commitment and
desire to succeed-- the passion to take the action steps
that lead to success. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, as a musician, I get really excited about
finding playing jobs. Neither ten-foot snow drifts nor
alligators in the gutters will stop me from trying. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">What do you get excited about? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Think seriously about this for a moment. You need this
pumped-up attitude to pursue the lifestyle you dream about.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">What do you really, truly get giggly-excited about?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Would you cross the Amazon river for a Chocolate Forest
Ice Cream Sundae? Sounds silly and dangerous to me, but is
it your thing? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Would you bypass your mother-in-law's birthday party to
photograph the sunset from the white sands of New Mexico?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>That's not silly. My hand is raised.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mighty rivers and mother-in-laws fall away in the pursuit
of excitable goals.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Funny thing is, when you entertain excitable thoughts, you
often discover the direction your life's work should take.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Here's the formula: </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Dream + Attitude + Action = Living Right</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it worth it to live right? Yes, for obvious reasons. If
nothing else, it's worth it just to avoid bitter coffee and
tight-fitting clothes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In the end, any work that lacks right-attitude is just a
job.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
