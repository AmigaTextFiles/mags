<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Quick, quick, grab that puppy and put her on the papers!!!</B>" As we herd the puppies back to their area of the room. We could hardly believe it had been a few weeks since we witnessed the miracle of their births. Helping to bring puppies into the world is definitely an experience. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The puppies were Samoyeds. Those fluffy white, big, loveable dogs that sometimes pull sleds out in the Arctic. I fell in love with them years before, adopting our first from a nice home that raised and showed them. Lily was a bit of an outcast because she was too large to show and too old to breed. We loved her and she was a part of our family, just like our little sheltie/border collie, named Dutchess. We had had Dutchess from a pup and she had been with me, through thick and thin, even outlasting a marriage.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had cats and dogs, birds and fish, rabbits and maybe even a few other odd pets. I have always loved animals and felt the compassion and unconditional love they have to share. I even love cows and had one that was my own; they have the sweetest eyes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had my heart broken when some animals I loved have passed on or when my Mother would take my cat away, because she was a female and back then, it was not a cheap thing to do to have pets spayed and neutered. I have cried many tears over animals, and odd how I cry more for them than many humans.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Humans have the capacity to think and put thought into action. They have common sense, or most of them do, they can speak, ask for help and do so much more than animals, for themselves. For most animals they have to rely on their eyes and subtle "animal" messages to get their point across. They need humans to intercede for them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, I realized how many animals there were in the world, well, just a fraction and how hard it was for us to even place our puppies in the right homes with good people. I then had all my dogs spayed and neutered so we would not help add to the population.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been the type person to feel the hair go up on the back of my neck when I have seen an animal mistreated. I would get angry and say what was on my mind. I would then cry for the animal. I am one that stands my ground and will stand up for what I believe in, as some of you know.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have over the years, taken in many unwanted animals. I started taking in dogs, cats and birds. The birds just kept coming and we at one time had one hundred birds. I had also added to them by buying some and having pairs to breed. I do breed the rare breeds and hand feed the babies, selling them to help feed our gang. I just love the love they give back to me, and you should hear the conversations in our home, between the birds, hehe. We have to behave ourselves and watch our tempers and what we say, because they will always, like children, pick up what they shouldn't and repeat it.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel good, in my heart, that over the years we have been responsible pet owners. We are not ones to get rid of a pet because its not cute or little anymore or noisy or makes messes. We have raised them with love and have been here now for the older ones to pass on. We love them and stay with them to the end. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recently, actually today, had one of our older dogs pass on, she had been sick for a while. We know she is in a better place with our other dogs and pets that have passed and that she is no longer in pain and can now run with the wind once more over the rainbow bridge.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you love animals, please remember to have them spayed or neutered. Consider adopting a nice pet from the SPCA or a shelter near you. Help other people spay and neuter also, that can't afford it. Offer to take the animal for them to the vet. It's a small thing to do to help the animals all over the world that are not love or wanted. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remember the pets around you today! Give them a hug and say thank you for all the joy and love they have shared with you in your life. I would truly not like to see a world without animals and I do my part to help the wild and the domestic.&nbsp; Won't you??&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Thank you</B>~*</P>
