<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to admit, While surfing through the Aminet I passed over
<B>BareED</B> several times before I plucked up enough interest to
download it and have a look.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well after all, Text Editors are one thing the Amiga has plenty
of, and supporting a name like "<B>BareED</B>" it really didn't seem to
have much to offer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume that every Amiga user will use a text Editor at some time
in their lives, I myself use three text editors on a regular basis</P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Edword Pro:-</B> My preferred editor is used for almost all formatting
work.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>GoldED:-</B> Used mainly for its excellent html Plug in</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Article Editor :-</B> Came batched with Propage, Has the excellent
feature of "Save highlight region" Excellent for chopping up large
files or extracting certain areas of text.</P>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be noted that each editor is used for it certain ability
to complete a function, So what could <B>BareED</B> have to offer that
these excellent editors don't.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well first of all don't get confused about the choice of name for this program, A brief look at the Programmer's notes (Detailed below) Shows the <B>BareED</B> is actually quite a powerful tool, And hopefully later versions will further improve the program into a complete, usable Text Editor.</P>

<CENTER><B>Simple text editor which supports proportional fonts.</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simple  text  editor  which  can  support proportional fonts and graphic
cards.  Present  in  the beta stage. Still missing such nice things like
folding,  multiple  projects  and  much  more, offers however already in
this version relief for proportional fonts as well as variable colours.</P>

Does not use the Amiga console driver but the graphics primitives.<BR>
Requires OS 3 and a 68020 CPU.<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now the part that really caught my eye, Was the ability of <B>BareED</B> to use Amiga Fonts. I often use a text editor to write/Print short notes (Rather than load up Wordworth or any other wordProcessor) However most editors only allow you to use a basic font, <B>BareED</B> suddenly started to look very interesting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see from the above Graphic, With BareED you can select the font you want, and also adjust the Font Colour, and background colour.</P>

<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tests on printing using <B>BareED</B> and Workbench fonts, have shown that the Fonts selected will be used in printing, However at the moment letters (etc) will only print in black. However this is of course only a Beta version of, What appears to be a nice Text Edtor, and I just hope that suffient interest will be shown in it, to incourage the Programmer to continue with the work.</P>
