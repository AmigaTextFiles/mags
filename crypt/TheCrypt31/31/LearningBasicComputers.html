<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's always a great to know the history of the things or concepts and 
to know how a particular concept evolved. This gives a better 
understanding of the concept and you feel even more interested in the 
matter. So starting from the very early days, it was some 1000 BC 
when the first calculating device was used, the Abacus. It had 
several bars with circular beads, which were moved up and down the 
bars to represent number. We will not go down to the macro details of 
how calculations were performed using the Abacus. Then we had the 
development of the Pascal's calculator, the Difference Engine and 
many mechanical devices that were capable of performing the basic 
operations.  Then the actual man, the father of computers, Charles 
Babbage, came into the picture. He gave the concept of a computing 
machine which would have a memory unit and an arithmetic and logic 
unit. He is still respected and popularly known as the father of 
computers, as his conceptual design is still being used by computer 
manufacturers although now things are more complicated and the design 
has a lot of appendages.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The history of computers has been divided into five generations each 
one of which constitute about a decade. The first generation of 
computers was characterized by huge machines with wires running 
several 100 meters.  These machines were built using vacuum tubes and 
used to generate a lot of heat. Hence they required a water-cooling 
system for maintaining the temperature. The machines being giants 
consumed lot of electricity and it is said the lights in the city 
went dim when such a computer was switched on. The computers in the 
second generation were built using "transistors". These consumed less 
power and generated less heat. The size of the computer also was 
reduced drastically. The third generation brought a revolutionary 
change in the way a computer was made. The world saw the invention of 
integrated chips, each of which had 100s of transistors. As time 
passed the technology improved and the SSI (Small Scale Integration), 
LSI (Large Scale Integration) and VLSI technologies (Very Large Scale 
Integration) came up.  The only difference in the above mentioned 
technologies was based on the number of number of transistors that 
could be fused on a single chip. This is how we have reached a point 
today, were we have desktops, laptops and even palmtops. The later 
articles will continue my basic lessons on computer finally reaching 
to advanced levels. </P>
