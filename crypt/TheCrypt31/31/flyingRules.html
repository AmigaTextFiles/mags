<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1.</B> If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger. If you pull the
stick back, they get smaller.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">That is, unless you keep pulling the stick all the way back, then they
get bigger again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2.</B> Flying isn't dangerous. Crashing is what's dangerous.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3.</B> The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.</B> The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keep
the pilot cool. When it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start sweating.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5.</B> A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great'
landing is one after which they can use the plane again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>6.</B> Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make
all of them yourself</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>7.</B> You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power to
taxi to the ramp.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>8.</B> The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of
arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of survival and vice
versa.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>9. </B>Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about
might be another airplane going in the opposite direction.
Reliable sources also report that mountains have been known to hide out
in clouds</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>10.</B> There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing.
unfortunately no one knows what they are.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>11.</B> Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>12.</B> In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminium going
hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour,
the ground has yet to lose.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>13.</B> It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as much
as possible.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>14.</B> Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And it's
not subject to repeal.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>15</B>. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going round
and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger
compartment, things are not at all as they should be.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
