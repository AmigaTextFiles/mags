<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  day after being sentenced,  the Kid was loaded  into  a
coach for the five-day journey to Lincoln,  and again was told  if
there were a rescue attempt or a lynch mob,  his guards would kill
him  first.   There were seven heavily armed men  in  the  escort,
including Bill Mathews,  John "King of the Rustlers" Kinney,   and
the  burly  Bob Olinger.  All three fought on the Dolan  side  and
were prejudiced against the Kid,  Olinger in particular. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid
and  Olinger had a mutual hatred because Olinger shot John  Jones,
a friend of the Kid's,  in cold-blood. Afterwards, Olinger learned
the  Kid  wanted to kill him in revenge;  this sparked the  bitter
animosity.   During  the  long  trip  to  Lincoln,   Olinger  took
advantage  of  the  Kid's  helpless   situation  by  taunting  and
provoking  him  to escape.  The Kid kept his sense  of  humor  and
ignored him.  It was a tense trip.  If the Kid so much as  made  a
wrong move,  his guards would have shot him,  but sources  say  he
remained in good spirits.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally on April 21,  the Kid arrived in Lincoln.  There was no
suitable jail,  so the Kid was confined in a backroom adjoined  to
Garrett's office,  in the old two-story Murphy store,   which  was
now a courthouse.  He was to remain handcuffed and shackled at all
times,  and was either chained to the floor,  or a line was  drawn
across  the room,  which he was forbidden to cross or he would  be
shot. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garrett had two of his deputies remain with the Kid in  the
room,   as  a 24-hour guard,  this would eliminate any  chance  of
escape. The two guards were Olinger and James Bell.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any other prisoner would have given up hope and come to  grips
with  his fate,  but not the Kid!  His mind was still at  work  on
escaping,  but time was running out.  The Kid had to act  fast  on
the first opportunity,  but he had to wait patiently for the right
moment.  If he made the slightest wrong move or even looked as  if
he  was  thinking of escape,  Olinger would split him in two  with
his shotgun, which he teased the Kid everyday with.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  week after the Kid's arrival,  Garrett had left Lincoln  to
collect taxes,  leaving his two guards in charge.  On April 28, at
noon,   with only two lawmen in the whole town,  the Kid  saw  his
golden  opportunity.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He knew it was Olinger's turn  to  take  the
other prisoners,  who were also confined at the courthouse, across
the  street for lunch at the Wortley Hotel (the Kid ate his  meals
in his room),  which meant only Bell would be at the courthouse to
guard him.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid knew,  out of his two guards, it would be best
to  make  his move on Bell who was easy-going and not on  a  power
trip  as  Olinger was.  As soon as Olinger was long gone with  the
other prisoners,  eating his meal, the Kid then made his move. The
only time the Kid was allowed to leave the room was for visits  to
the privy, so he asked Bell to take him outside.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been numerous versions of what happened next,   but
there  are  two  that are most widely accepted by  historians  and
Billy  the  Kid  enthusiast.  One version,  which seems  the  more
popular,  is that the Kid retrieved a gun that was hidden  in  the
privy  by a friend.  As he entered the courthouse and climbed  the
stairs  to his room,  he reached the top,  turned around with  the
gun  drawn,  and told Bell to surrender.  Bell panicked,  he  spun
around to run back down the stairs, and the Kid shot him.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But  the next version,  which I find the most logical,   comes
from the Kid himself.  After his escape, the Kid, told his friend,
John  Meadows,  whom he visited right after he left  town  a  free
man,   that he slipped his small hand out of the one of the cuffs,
whacked Bell over the head and jerked Bell's revolver out  of  the
holster  and  told him to throw up his hands.  But instead,   Bell
turned  and ran down the stairs and the Kid shot him.   This  then
explains the two gashes found on Bell's head,  the scuffling sound
which was heard from the groundskeeper,  Gottfried Gauss,  who was
standing  outside  by the door and caught  the  dying  Bell,   and
lastly,  it explains why Bell just ran instead of pulling out  his
own  gun  and shooting as he fled.  After all,  Bell was a veteran
lawman, and couldn't have been that timid (or stupid).</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At  the restaurant,  Olinger heard the shots fired and  darted
outside.   As he rounded the gate into the yard of the courthouse,
he  heard a familiar voice,  <B>"Hello Bob."</B> he looked up and saw the
Kid at the window with his own shotgun pointing right at him.   At
that  moment,   the  groundskeeper came running  from  behind  the
building,   saw  Olinger and yelled out,  <B>"The Kid  killed  Bell!"</B>
Olinger then replied,  <B>"Yes, and he's killed me too."</B> The Kid then
let  Olinger  have  it with both barrels,  and his  tormentor  and
killer of his friend John Jones, fell dead.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next,  he had Gauss toss him up a small pick that was lying  on
the ground,  and told him to saddle a horse.  The towns people made
no  move  to interfere as the Kid took his sweet time in  leaving.
After using the pick to free only one leg from the shackles,   the
Kid  went  out  on  the balcony and saw that  a  small  crowd  had
gathered  and  was watching from across the street;   a  witness's
statement of what the Kid said would verify how he killed Bell:</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"He  stood  on  the upper porch in front of the  building  and
talked  with the people who were in Wortley's,  but he  would  not
let  anyone come towards him.  He told the people that he did  not
want to kill Bell,  but as he ran,  he had to.  He said he grabbed
Bell's  revolver and told him to hold up his hands and  surrender;
that  Bell decided to run and he had to kill him.  He declared  he
was  `standing pat' against the world;  and while he did not  wish
to  kill  anybody,   if anybody interfered  with  his  attempt  to
escape, he would kill him."</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After arming himself with revolvers and a rifle,  he went down
the  stairs and out the back door.  As he passed the body of Bell,
Gauss  heard him say,  <B>"I'm sorry I had to kill you,  but couldn't
help  it." </B>As the Kid went around the building to the gate,   with
Gauss probably following with the saddled horse,  the Kid came  to
the  blood-soaked body of Olinger,  without  the  remorse  he  had
showed for Bell,  he kicked the corpse and said <B>"You're not  going
to  round  me  up  again!"</B> The Kid mounted  the  horse  with  some
difficulty,  on account of his leg irons that were  dangling  from
one  leg,  and rode off.  The townsmen made no move to  stop  him,
though  they could have easily mobbed or shot him to  death,   but
instead  they  stood back and allowed him to  escape.   It  wasn't
because they were paralyzed with fear,  as Garrett claimed;   but 
more  likely,  it was out of sympathy and understanding  of  Billy
the Kid's circumstances.</P>



   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of making a run for the border,  the Kid hung around in
the  county,   dropping by on friends and telling them  about  his
daring  escape  from  jail,  as if he  had  just  come  back  from
vacation.  His friends advised him to leave the territory, but the
Kid  was  confident he wouldn't get caught,  and he told  them  he
would first go to Fort Sumner to get some money.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  the  next  two  months,  the Kid  hid  out  at  different
locations in San Miguel County,  but mostly in Fort Sumner.  There
was  a  number of Billy the Kid sightings,  but how many  of  them
were legitimate is up for debate.  One thing was for certain,  the
Kid  had  returned to his old haunts and was making  no  immediate
plans of leaving New Mexico.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile,  Sheriff Garrett was doing a low profile search for
the Kid.  Unlike before, he wouldn't form a large posse, nor would
he  even try to catch him alive.  His plan was to sneak up on  the
Kid and kill him.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By early July,  Garrett received word that  the
Kid  was  in or near Fort Sumner and he may have gotten  this  tip
from Pete Maxwell,  the older brother of Paulita Maxwell,  one the
Kid's girlfriends.  Maxwell didn't like the Kid around his sister,
who  was  going  to marry a prominent and wealthy  figure  in  New
Mexico.   So  with information on the Kid's whereabouts,   Garrett
took  John Poe and Kip McKinney with him,  men he could  trust  to
keep  their mouths shut and not question his actions,  and  headed
to Fort Sumner quietly.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was July 14,  1881.  The Kid was warned that the  law  was
looking  for  him  in the area,  so he hid out at a  sheepherder's
camp.   But by the afternoon or evening,  he decided to ride  into
Fort  Sumner.  Garrett had searched the area and even sent Poe  in
to town to look around;  frustrated, he was thinking about leaving
(or  he knew the Kid was at the Fort and was just waiting for  the
right  moment).  The Kid,  in the meantime,  was  hiding  in  town
unaware  that  Garrett was in the vicinity;  he visited  with  his
friends and sweethearts,  going from one house to the other,   but
where  exactly and with who he planned to stay with for the  night
is questionable.</P>

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was getting late and the residents were bedding down  for
the  night,  Garrett slipped out of the shadows and went  to  Pete
Maxwell's house to ask him about the Kid.  While Poe and  McKinney
waited  outside,   Garrett entered Maxwell's  room  and  woke  the
sleeping  man.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that moment,  the Kid,  who was  staying  at  a
friend's house,  was getting  hungry. His host or hostess told him
that  Maxwell  had  butchered a yearling,  and  for  him  to  help
himself to it,  then bring the meat back,  and they would cook for
him. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid  grabbed a butcher knife and stepped  outside  and
walked across the plaza to Maxwell's house.  As he approached  the
porch,   he almost stepped over the two men who were sitting  down
outside Maxwell's room.  The men rose and told the intruder not to
be  startled.   The Kid didn't recognize the men and  backed  into
Maxwell's dark bedroom.  Once inside he walked over to the bed and
in  a  low  voice  he  said <B>"Pete.Who are those fellows  outside?"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garrett was sitting at the foot of the bed;  Maxwell lay still and
whispered,  <B>"That's him."</B> The Kid walked closer  to  the  bed  and
again  asked  <B>"Pete?"</B>  then  he saw the  silhouette  of  a  figure
sitting  in  front of him. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid moved back slowly,   and  said
<B>"Quien  es?"</B> Garrett recalled in The Authentic Life of  Billy  the
Kid,  <B>"He must have recognized me, for he went backwards in a cat-
like  movement,   and  I jerked my gun and fired."</B>  Garrett  fired
twice,   the  Kid  fell to the floor,  and then both  Garrett  and
Maxwell  bolted out the door. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid was shot through the  heart
and  gasped for a minute or two and died.  The men outside huddled
outside  the  door  and  heard the Kid's  death  rattle  and  then
Maxwell got a candle and the men entered the room.  They found the
Kid  lying on his back in the middle of the room,  with a  gun  in
one  hand  and  a  knife in the other.  (This is  the  story  that
Garrett told and has been accepted;  but did it really happen this
way?  Was  the  Kid really armed or had his gun  drawn?  Since  he
didn't  die right away,  how come he didn't shoot back or  if  the
gun  was  in his hand,  surely the reaction of getting  hit  would
have caused the gun to go off,  but yet Garrett stated the Kid did
not  fire. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was it really coincidental that the Kid walked  in  on
Garrett  or  was Garrett waiting for him? According  to  McKinney,
Garrett  tied up and gagged one of the Kid's girlfriends  and  hid
in  the  room and waited for him to walk in.  I don't  know  about
you,   but something smells fishy.  Considering Garrett's  earlier
methods  of  dealing  with outlaws,  which was  by  ambush,   this
incident  probably  wasn't as "Kosher" -if you  will-  as  Garrett
would want us to believe).</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The residents were awakened by the gunfire and walked out into
the  plaza,  towards Maxwell's house.  Upon learning that the  Kid
was  dead,  men were shaking their fists at Garrett and women were
weeping.   Garrett  allowed the Kid's friends  to  take  his  body
across the plaza to the carpenter's shop,  to give him a wake. The
next morning,  Justice of the Peace Milnor Rudulph viewed the body
and  made  out  the death certificate,  but Garrett  rejected  the
first one,  and demanded another one be written more in his favor.
The  Kid's body was then prepared for burial,  and at noon he  was
laid  to rest next to his two friends,  Tom O'Folliard and Charlie
Bowdre.</P>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Mexico's famous outlaw Billy the Kid,  about nineteen  or
twenty years old, was gone, but his <B>legend was being born</B>.  </P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  the  Kid's death,  Garrett was viewed  with  suspicion,
though  there were many who were grateful for Garrett  riding  the
territory  of the famous outlaw,  just as many felt  it  was  foul
play.  To win public opinion, Garrett, with the help of Ash Upson,
wrote  a biography of Billy the Kid,  and if one reads it closely,
you  can sense Garrett's remorse.</P> 

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He hoped writing the book would
lift  the dark cloud that hung over him,  which may be why Garrett
portrayed  the Kid as half Satan,  to make the  Kid  a  threat  to
society  to gain reader's support for his actions,  and then  half
Saint,  to show his admiration for the Kid,  and how he  was  only
doing his duty in hunting the young outlaw.  Because of that,  the
book  made  a Judas out of Garrett for going after his old  friend
and  killing  him.  The biography ended up turning Billy  the  Kid
into the a legend and Pat Garrett as his killer.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">History has been very unfair to Billy the Kid.  I don't  think
any  other  western  historical figure has had  his  name  dragged
through  the  mud and represented so inaccurately and negatively. 
He never robbed banks or trains like Jesse James.  He never killed
without a probable cause,  like men such as John Wesley Hardin and
Clay Allison.  He never was a large-scale rustler, raiding ranches
and  terrorizing the inhabitants like John Selman or Jesse  Evans.
He never hurt,  raped or insulted women,  nor harm children or the
elderly.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I'll tell you who Billy the Kid was:  he was an orphan who
unintentionally fell into outlawry,  a lifestyle he  couldn't  get
out of.  He tried to make peace with the law and his enemies,  and
both times it backfired on him,  making things worse. He was never
the  captain  of the Regulators,  but just another  fighter.   The
Lincoln County War itself would have turned out the same way,   if
he had never taken part in it.  He killed only in self-defense and
during the war.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The men he killed weren't angels, but were either
bullies or outlaws,  like the case of  Morton and Baker,  who were
both  members of the "Boys." The lawmen he killed were not  honest
men  trying to "protect and serve," but crooked and corrupt.   The
Kid  did  steal livestock,  but in some rare cases he either  paid
for  or  returned  what  he had taken.  He even  recovered  stolen
livestock for small ranchers and judging by the poverty  state  he
was in, it seems he never stole enough.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm not saying Billy the Kid was an angel who rode around with
a  halo  over his head.  He did do some wrong,  but he was  not  a
Charles  Manson of the 19th century.  There were other outlaws  of
his  time  who  fit that bill,  and that's why no  one  today  has
really heard of them,  because they really were bad and not  worth
remembering.</P>
