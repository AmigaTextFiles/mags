<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man has spent many days crossing the Sahara without water. His 
trusty horse and camel have both long since died of thirst. Drier 
than a Californian raisin, he is on all fours crawling through the sands 
certain that he has breathed his last. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of a sudden he sees an object sticking out of the sand 2 yards 
ahead of him. He crawls to the object, pulls it out of the sand 
and discovers what looks to be an old brief case. He opens it and out pops a 
genie but this is no ordinary genie. He is dull looking character, wearing 
an Inland Revenue ID badge and a naff grey suit. There's a calculator in his pocket, 
and a pencil tucked behind one ear. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I><B>Well, sir</B></I>," drones the monotone genie. "<I><B>You know how it works. You 
have three wishes.</B></I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>I'm not falling for that old chestnut,</B>" replies the weary man. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>I'm not going to trust a tax inspector!</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>What do you have to lose? You've got no transportation, and it 
looks like you're a goner anyway!</B></I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sighing, the man thinks about this for a minute, and decides that 
the dull genie is right. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Ok, I wish I were in a lush oasis with plentiful food and drink</B>". </P>

delicacies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The man finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with 
rare gold coins, precious gems and a cheque which would keep the 
Beckhams for life (assuming one attempted kidnapping per decade). </P>
