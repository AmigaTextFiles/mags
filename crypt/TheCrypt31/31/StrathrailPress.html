<CENTER>Subject:   Class 31, 31327 for the Strathspey</CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agreement has been reached between the Strathspey Railway  Company
and  the  owner of the final Brush Class 31,  No.  31327  (D5862),
George  Littlejohn,  for the use of the locomotive on the Speyside
line.  The engine,  which has been overhauled at Bo'ness,  arrived
on the line on 16th July.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although not a native to the Highlands the loco will be  a  useful
addition to the diesel fleet replacing as it does D8020 which  has
returned to Bo'ness.  The loco's duties started almost immediately
by  hauling an early morning special working for Pathfinder  Tours
on  Saturday  19th July to and from Broomhill.  Its normal  duties
will  include working "The Royal Scotsman" on its  visits  to  the
railway  and occasional turns on the Strathspey's regular services
between Aviemore, Boat of Garten and Broomhill.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  thought  that the first appearance on timetabled  workings
will  be  on 4th August.  (Check the Superintendents page  on  the
railway's web-site:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At  time  of  purchase No.  31327 was located at Carlisle  Upperby
having been in store since 1996 and was moved from there  by  road
on  8th November 2001 to Bo'ness where restoration to full working
order  was  undertaken  by   the   SRPS  Diesel  Group  under  the
leadership of Stuart Seller Jr.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  in Grey Railfreight,  Red Stripe livery the loco was trialled
successfully  at Diesel Gala days on the Bo'ness & Kinneil  during
October '02 and May this year.</P>
