<CENTER>They pulled up in a station wagon</CENTER>
<CENTER>Lookin' for a horse to buy.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I didn't have many left -</CENTER>
<CENTER>Sold most to some camp guy.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>But there were four behind the barn</CENTER>
<CENTER>They'd look at if they could.</CENTER>
<CENTER>"What about that appaloosa?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>I replied, "She don't look too good."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>He said, "I used to own some horses</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I've got a pretty good eye</CENTER>
<CENTER>For judging conformation;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Her withers are slightly high."</CENTER>

<CENTER>She said, "Yes, but the bones are fine</CENTER>
<CENTER>And the forehead's nice and wide.</CENTER>
<CENTER>The shoulders are sloped just right;</CENTER>
<CENTER>And what a remarkably colored hide."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I drawled, "Yup, them spots are showy.</CENTER>
<CENTER>But no, I don't think you should</CENTER>
<CENTER>Take that mare on home with you</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Cause she don't look too good."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>They eyeballed her up and down,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Felt for flaws that might be hidden,</CENTER>
<CENTER>An' jest a lovin' that flashy coat</CENTER>
<CENTER>An' asked if she'd ever been ridden.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>"Most likely has, but this mare's</CENTER>
<CENTER>More for makin' colts in a brood.</CENTER>
<CENTER>You don't want her for ridin'</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Cause she don't look too good."</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>With that I hopped upon her back</CENTER>
<CENTER>To prove she wouldn't buck.</CENTER>
<CENTER>They smiled at each other</CENTER>
<CENTER>An' I knew I was in luck.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I said, "She's priced eight hundred, firm."</CENTER>
<CENTER>They had the cash on hand.</CENTER>
<CENTER>They asked, "Can you deliver?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"I'll go load her in the van."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Next day he came back snortin' fire,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"You lying, horse tradin' hood.</CENTER>
<CENTER>You cheat, that appaloosa's blind."</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>"I told ya...she don't look too good."</B></CENTER>
