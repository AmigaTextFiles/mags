<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a nice lady who was a little old-fashioned. She was planning a 
weeks vacation in Florida at a particular campground, but she wanted to make
sure of the accommodations. Uppermost in her mind were toilet facilities,
but she couldn't bring herself to write "toilet" in a letter. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After considerable deliberation, she settled on "<B>bathroom commode</B>", but when she
wrote that own it still sounded too forward. So, in her letter to the
campground, she referred to the bathroom commode as the '<B>B.C.</B>'.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Does the campground have it's own "<B>B.C.?</B>" is what she actually wrote. </P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The campground owner was baffled. He showed the letter around to several of 
the campers, but they couldn't decipher it either. Finally, the owner
figured she was referring to the location of the local <B>Baptist church</B>: so,
he sat down and wrote back to her as follows: </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Dear Madam:</B></P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  regret very much the delay in answering your letter, but I now take the 
pleasure in informing you that the '<B>B.C.</B>' is located nine miles north of the
campgrounds, and is capable of seating 250 people at one time.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I admit it is
quite a distance away, if you are in the habit of going regularly, but, no
doubt, you will be pleased to know that a great number of people take their
lunches along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay
late. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last time my wife and I went was six years ago. It was so crowded
we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may interest you to know
that right now there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more seats.
They're going o hold it in the basement of the "<B>B.C.</B>" I would like to say
it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly, it is no lack of
desire on my part. As we grow older, it seems to be more
effort--particularly in cold weather. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you decide to come to our campground, perhaps I could go with you the 
first time. I'd sit with you and introduce you to all the other folks.
Remember, this is a friendly community!! Hope to see you soon.</P>
