<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  worst part of the Lincoln County War was over.  The  Kid-
and  what  was left of the Regulators- wandered in  the  hills  on
foot,   until  they stole some horses and made their  way  to  San
Patricio,   a  small  Mexican  village  fourteen  miles  south  of
Lincoln.   After lying low for about two weeks  to  avoid  capture
from the new sheriff,  George Peppin,  the Regulators rode to  the
Mescalero Apache Reservation Agency by Blazer's Mill.  Aside  from
themselves,  they also had three Mexicans with them;  one of  them
was  the former constable,  Atanacio Martinez.  While the Kid  and
the  Regulators  headed to a spring to water  their  horses,   the
Mexicans continued down the road towards the Agency. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mexicans
then  encountered some Mescalero Indians,  who figured  they  were
there  to  steal  horses,  and started to shoot at  them.   Indian
agent  Fred  Godfrey  and  his clerk Morris  Bernstein  heard  the
shooting,   and Bernstein,  without delay,  mounted  a  horse  and
rather  foolishly galloped to where the shooting was coming  from.
Antanacio would later say,  that Bernstein had fired at him,   and
in self-defense he fired back, killing Bernstein.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile at the spring,  the Kid and the others dismounted  to
water their horses when suddenly the gunfire broke out.  The Kid's
horse reared up and pulled away,  leaving the Kid on foot.  George
Coe  pulled  the Kid up behind him on his horse and the Regulators
took  off.   Then  taking advantage of the commotion,   they  rode
around towards the corrals,  and while the Kid was getting himself
a new mount,  the others opened the gate and made off with all the
agency's  horses  and mules.  Though Antanacio  would  later  turn
himself  in  and admit to killing Bernstein in self-defense,   the
Kid  once again would be credited,  even though he never  fired  a
shot. </P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Regulators rode north to Fort Sumner,  an old  army  fort
turned  Mexican village,  which would become like a  home  to  the
Kid.  The Regulators lived the life of Riley by dancing at bailes,
carousing and visiting with pretty senoritas.  But as time passed,
the  Coe cousins and Fred Waite were tired of dodging the law  and
wanted to settle down,  so they quit the Regulators.  The Kid,  on
the other hand,  wasn't yet tired of his wild ways,  so he and the
remaining Regulators went back to Lincoln.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  taunting and intimidating his enemies in Lincoln,   the
Kid  and  his  gang  raided Fritz Ranch and  made  off  with  some
horses.   They  then headed to the Texas Panhandle  and  sold  the
horse  with no questions asked at Tascosa,  Texas.  The  residents
didn't  seem to care about the gang's presence,  as long  as  they
behaved themselves and didn't cause any trouble.  The Kid  settled
right  in  at  Tascosa,  and much as he did in  Fort  Sumner,   he
partied  every  night and competed in target  shooting  and  horse
racing.</P>



   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Kid was whooping it up in Tascosa,  things in Lincoln
weren't faring any better.  Residents were pleased to see Governor
Axtell  finally  replaced by a new governor,   a  retired  general
named  Lew Wallace,  but all hell was still breaking loose.   John
Selman  formed  a  ruthless  gang   called  <B>"The  Rustlers"</B>  which
consisted of the most dangerous badmen in the territory,  most  of
them  were  former members of the Boys.  The Rustlers  went  on  a
rampage  of raiding and burning down ranches,  killing anyone  who
got in their way,  and even gang raping two women and shooting two
young  Mexican boys just for the hell of it.  When  someone  brave
enough to ask who they were,  they yelled out <B>"We are devils  just
come  from  Hell!"</B>  Billy the Kid never or would  even  considered
behaving  in such a manner!  The Rustlers' actions even  disgusted
the  Kid and he would later inform on them.  Yet history tends  to
forget  about  the  <B>"Rustlers"</B> and  brand  the  Kid  as  the  sole
terrorist of New Mexico.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Regulators broke up in Tascosa,  and  the  Rustlers  left
Lincoln County and would eventually split up as well.  As for  the
Kid,  he and his long time sidekick Tom O'Folliard returned to New
Mexico and Lincoln County.  It had been less then two months since
the  Kid was in Lincoln,  and things had actually started to quiet
down.   The new governor had offered an amnesty proclamation,   in
hopes  to  smolder  out what was left of the Lincoln  County  War.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since  everyone else was being forgiven and able to  settle  down,
the  Kid didn't see why he couldn't.  By now the Kid was tired  of
running  and  wanted  to  square himself  with  the  law  and  his
enemies;  knowing he didn't qualify for Governor Wallace's pardon,
he  decided to clear himself with his adversaries.  So  with  good
intentions  he  put  out a peace offer to James  Dolan  and  Jesse
Evans.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On February 18,  1879 both sides of the Lincoln County War met
for a parley.  After a tense moment instigated by Jesse Evans, who
wanted  to kill the Kid on the spot,  both sides calmed  down  and
talked  it out.  While this was happening,  Sheriff Kimbrell  (who
had  replaced  Peppin)   hightailed it  to  Fort  Stanton  to  get
military  assistance  to  arrest the  Kid. </P> 

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the  meantime  an
agreement  was finally made between the two sides:  neither  party
will  kill  any member without first giving notice of  withdrawing
from  the  treaty,   all persons who have  acted  as  friends  are
included in the agreement and are not to be molested,  no  officer
or  soldier are to be killed for any act previous to the  date  of
the  agreement,   neither party shall testify against  the  other,
each  party  must  aid the other in avoiding capture  or  help  in
their escape,  and lastly, anyone who failed to carry out or break
the  agreement  would  be  killed on  sight.   After  a  round  of
handshakes  and  swearing to the treaty,  the two  sides  went  to
celebrate at every saloon in town.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  hour  was  late and the men were drunk as they  staggered
from  one  tavern to the next,  residents stayed out of their  way
but  watched  from a distance,  and it seemed everyone anticipated
what  was  going  to  happen next.  The men then  came  upon  Mrs.
McSween's attorney,  Huston Chapman.  Mrs. McSween was going after
the  Dolan  faction  and  Colonel Dudley  for  the  death  of  her
husband,   which  made not only her,  but also Chapman  a  target.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dolan  and  his men stopped the attorney and began to  harass  and
threaten him.  The Kid, who was probably the only sober one in the
group,  sensed a killing;  witnesses would later report,  he tried
to walk away,  but Jesse Evans blocked him and made him stay. Bill
Campbell,  a friend of both Evans and Dolan,  pulled out  his  gun
and  pointed it at Chapmen.  Dolan too,  pulled out  his  gun  and
fired it in the ground at Chapman.  Campbell then reacted  to  the
sound and pulled the trigger of his gun,  shooting Chapman in  the
chest and killing him.  The Dolan men then poured whiskey over his
body  and set fire to it and walked away rejoicing.  The  Kid  and
Tom  O'Folliard  had  no  choice  but  to  follow  the  men  to  a
restaurant.  While eating oysters,  Dolan suggested  that  one  of
them  should go back to the Chapman's body and put a  gun  in  his
hand,   so  they  could say that the shooting was in self-defense.
The  Kid  was anxious to leave this group and eagerly volunteered.
But once outside,  the Kid,  did nothing of the sort;  instead, he
and O'Folliard immediately mounted their horses and skinned out.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Outraged  by  the  cold-bloodied   killing  of  the  attorney,
Governor  Wallace went to Lincoln to oversee  the  arrest  of  the
killers.   While  talking with residents about the  incident,   he
learned  the Kid was a front row witness to the murder.   The  Kid
realized  that  this was an opportunity to right his  wrong,   and
square himself with the law.  If he could get on the side  of  the
governor,   who  needed  him  as a witness  to  convict  Chapman's
killers,  he could make deal for amnesty and finally settle  down.
But  by  testifying  he  would be breaking  the  treaty  with  his
enemies,  which was punishable by death. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This would be the biggest
gamble  of his young life,  but the reward would be well worth  it.   On
March  13,   1879  the Kid wrote to the governor  and  offered  to
testify  against Chapman's murderers in exchange for an  annulment
of  his indictments.  The governor wrote back inviting the Kid  to
meet  with  him.  In his letter to the Kid,  he  wrote,</P>  

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I><B>"I  have
authority  to exempt you from prosecution if you will  testify  to
what  you say you know," and he closed with:  "If you could  trust
Jesse Evans, you can trust me."</B></I></P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On March 17,  the Kid met the governor in Lincoln.  During the
meeting,  Governor Lew Wallace made the promise the Kid had  hoped
for.   The governor stated clearly,  that if the Kid testified  in
court,  that <I><B>"In return for you're doing this,  I will let you  go
scot-free  with  a pardon in your pocket for all  your  misdeeds."</B></I><BR>
 The  agreement was made.  The Kid would submit to a fake  arrest,
testify  against  Chapman's  killers,   James  Dolan  and  Colonel
Dudley,  for a full pardon.  A couple days later,  the Kid and Tom
O'Folliard  surrendered to Sheriff Kimbrell as  planned  and  were
confined at Patron's store.  The governor interviewed the Kid,  by
asking  him  about the Rustlers' hideouts and trails,  also  about
the  rustling  activities and tricks of the trade.  The  following
month  the Kid began his court appearances.  Due to the fact  that
Judge Bristol and prosecutor William Rynerson were Dolan men,  the
defendants  were either pardoned under the governor's proclamation
or acquitted. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then it was the Kid's turn.  Instead of being tried
in  Lincoln  where  he  had  a  chance for acquittal,   prosecutor
Rynerson got a change of venue to Dona Ana County,  where the  Kid
didn't  stand  a chance.  But that wasn't the Kid's only  problem,
the  governor wasn't making good his promise of a pardon and  left
the Kid to his fate,  while he went back to Santa Fe to finish his
book Ben Hur.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid had been used.  He risked his life to carry out his end
of  the  deal,   told the governor and the courts everything  they
wanted  to  know,   and helped Mrs.  McSween  by  testify  against
Colonel Dudley for the death of her husband. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now his enemies were
angrier than ever with him and would do anything to see him  dead.
The Kid's guards at Patron's store understood his predicament  and
let  him  walk  out and leave.  The Kid rode out of Lincoln,   and
understandably feeling betrayed,  now he was right back  where  he
started...<B>a wanted man.</B></P>



    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid  returned to his old ways,  as he had no choice.   He
couldn't  settle down and live an honest life,  since his  enemies
and  the  law were after him.  So,  to make a living the Kid  went
back  to  his old occupation of  rustling and gambling.  While  in
Fort  Sumner,   he  reunited  with  his  old  friends  and  former
Regulators,  Charlie Bowdre and Doc Scurlock,  and rustled  cattle
on and off from John Chisum's herds.  The Kid believed Chisum owed
him fighting wages during the late Lincoln County War,  but Chisum
denied  this,  and so the Kid would just steal from his herds  for
the unpaid wages.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  January  10,  1880,  the Kid was involved  in  his  second
<B>"single handedly"</B> killing,  and like Windy Cahill,  he was another
loudmouth bully that got on the Kid's nerves;  a fellow named  Joe
Grant.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While  the  Kid was at a saloon in Fort  Sumner,   having
drinks  with  Jim Chisum (John's brother)  and  a  couple  of  his
cowboys,   the  Kid encountered a drunk who was  trying  to  start
trouble  with  him.  Grant vowed that he would kill  someone  that
night,   and the Kid had an idea who it would be.</P>

  As the  evening
went  on,  Joe Grant was getting more obnoxious.  Then he  noticed
one  of  Chisum's cowboys had a nice ivory hand revolver,   so  he
took  it and replaced it with his own.  The cowboy knew better  to
contest  it,  but the Kid saw his chance to cover himself  against
the  rowdy  drunk.  The Kid knew the cowboy  had  fired  that  gun
earlier at a target,  so he lifted Grant's stolen gun out  of  the
holster,   and spun the barrel so the trigger would hit  an  empty
chamber.   Later when the Kid turned to walk out the door,   Grant
drew his gun and fired <B>"click click."</B> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon hearing the click,  the
Kid  wheeled about,  drew his gun and fired <B>"BANG BANG BANG,"</B>  and
Joe  Grant  was  dead.  The killing was considered another  saloon
fracas,   and  since  Joe  Grant was no  one  important,   it  was
forgotten about as quickly as it happened.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By now the Kid was eighteen or nineteen (?)  and had spent the
last  five years of his life wandering and running from  the  law.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  he rode out of Lincoln (with a knife in his back),  he  was
causing  quite  a   stir   stealing   livestock  and  dabbling  in
counterfeiting.  Though there were other outlaws and  rustlers  in
the area causing trouble,  the Kid was singled out, thanks in part
to his powerful enemies who wanted him dead.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of  their  ways  was   through  the  news  press,   which
exaggerated  his  outlawry and built up his <B>"bad boy"</B>  reputation,
by making him much worse than he really was.  The Kid was tired of
this stressful lifestyle,  and wanted out.  But before pulling  up
stakes and leaving the territory altogether,  he decided  to  make
one  last  ditch  effort at clearing himself. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Kid  wrote  to
Attorney  Ira  Leonard (who tried to help him  months  earlier  in
Lincoln  to  get his pardon),  asking if he could  help  him  once
again to "straighten things out." Leonard sent him a note to  meet
him in White Oaks in Lincoln County right away.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About this time,  when the Kid was contacting Leonard,  a tall
lanky  man by the name of <B>Pat Garrett</B> won the election for Lincoln
County  Sheriff.  Garrett and Billy the Kid knew each  other  from
Fort Sumner;  Garrett had worked as a cowhand for Pete Maxwell and
then as a bartender.  Thought Garrett and the Kid were never close
friends as legend says,  but he did seem to know the Kid  and  his
friends,  more than as just acquaintances.  The fact that he  knew
the  Kid's hideouts and trails may suggest,  that he may very well
have  rustled  a  time or two with the Kid (as the  Kid's  friends
would later claim).</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kid arrived in White Oaks to meet with Leonard,  but  the
attorney  was not there,  probably because the Kid was  about  six
weeks  late.  The Kid learned he was in Lincoln,  so  he  and  his
friends  stocked  up on supplies at a store (which  they  may  not
have  paid for)  and rode out.  A posse from White Oaks,   led  by
James  Carlyle,  went after the gang and sneaked up on them  at  a
camp.   Gunfire  broke out and the outlaws scattered  and  mounted
their  horse to make a break.  The Kid's horse was shot  out  from
under  him  and he ran off on foot.  Even though they were  caught
completely by surprise, the Kid and his friends got away.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But four days later,  the posse caught up with the Kid and his
gang hiding out at a ranch owned by Jim Greathouse.  The house was
surrounded,   so  the  Kid  invited the  posse's  leader,   Deputy
Carlyle,  to come in to talk things over. To guarantee his safety,
Greathouse offered himself as a hostage to the posse  and  Carlyle
went  in  the house.  The Kid learned Carlyle had no warrants  for
their arrest and refused to surrender;  he then told Carlyle he'll
have  to  stay  and  lead  them out when  they  make  a  break  at
nightfall.  The posse outside was getting anxious and  notes  were
exchanged  back  and  forth.  The lawmen  then  demanded  that  if
Carlyle  wasn't  released in five minutes,   Greathouse  would  be
killed.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happened next is up for debate.  Greathouse's partner Fred
Kuch,   who was the messenger boy and the ranch cook,   Joe  Steck
were  told  by the posse to make for cover because the  posse  was
going to rush the house.  No sooner did the two men make a run for
it,   shots were fired,  followed by a window shattering and James
Carlyle  falling  dead.   The posse would  later  report  that  an
accidental  shot  was  fired from their side  and  then  they  saw
Carlyle  leap out the window and try to run from the  house.</P>  

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The
Kid  then  threw himself halfway out the window,  took  deliberate
aim  and  shot  the  deputy  in cold blood.   Another  claim  made
several  weeks  later after the Kid's capture by James  Bell  (who
was  a  member of Carlyle's posse),  said that Billy the Kid  gang
member,   Dave Rudabaugh confessed that both he and  Billy  Wilson
(another  gang member)  fired one shot each and the Kid  twice  at
Carlyle.   But  remember  where this  statement  came  from.   Did
Rudabaugh  really say that or was Bell trying to cover  his  butt?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Keep in mind that if Carlyle was a good buddy of Bell's,  than why
did  Bell treat the Kid so fairly when he would later guarded over
him  at the courthouse in Lincoln? Not only did Bell win the Kid's
confidence and trust,  but also his regret for killing  him.   Now
doesn't  that  sound  a  little odd?  Was  Bell  just   an  overly
forgiving person or did he feel a little regretful that Billy  was
getting pinned with a killing he help commit?</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a letter to the governor concerning the incident,  the  Kid
wrote  that  when Carlyle heard the gunshot outside,   he  thought
Greathouse was killed and then dove out the window and was  killed
by  his  own  posse.  Since Kuch and Steck did say,  "about  60-75
shots were fired at us,  bullets flying from all directions," that
tells  us  that  the posse was doing some trigger-happy  shooting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  Carlyle was killed,  the confused posse left and  now  that
the coast was clear,  the Kid and his gang rode out themselves. So
why would the posse,  who had the place completely surrounded  and
were getting ready to rush the house,  suddenly ride off and leave
Deputy Carlyle's killers free to escape? Because they made a  boo-
boo  and  panicked. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless,  the Kid  is  blamed  for  the
shooting,  and even to this day most  believe that the Kid  killed
James  Carlyle.   In Jon Tuska's book Billy  the  Kid:   Life  and
Legend,   he  mentions,  "Neither Wilson nor  the  Kid  were  ever
indicted  by  the Lincoln County grand jury for this  crime.   The
members  of  the White Oaks posse chose silence rather  then  risk
exposure."  Because of the lack of evidence,   it's  not  fair  to
charge  Billy the Kid with this killing and he very well may  have
told  the truth when he said:  "(Carlyle)  was killed by  his  own
party, they thinking it was me trying to make my escape."</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the incident at Greathouse's ranch,  the Kid and his gang
headed  back towards Fort Sumner.  The Kid had enough and  decided
it  was time to leave for good.  The gang would go to Fort Sumner,
get money and supplies and kiss New Mexico farewell.</P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new Lincoln County Sheriff,  Pat Garrett had plans of  his
own,   he  was heading for Fort Sumner too.  Garrett was  bent  on
capturing  the  Kid,  not only for the money,   but  the  fame  of
bringing in New Mexico's most notorious outlaw.  </P>

   <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Time had run out for Billy the Kid.</B></P>
