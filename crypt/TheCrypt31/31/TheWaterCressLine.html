gradients  of any steam railway in the south of England  requiring
us  to  use large engines to haul our authentic coaches 'over  the

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All  return  tickets for the complete round trip  entitle  you  to
unlimited travel on the Watercress Line on the day of issue,   and
single  journeys  may  be broken at either  or  both  of  the  two
intermediate stations.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ropley  is  an  interesting place at which to break your  journey.
There  you  will  find   the   Railway's   engineering  works  and
locomotive yard,  together with a picnic site containing  a  small
children's  play  area.  A short walk away is  a  wildlife  meadow
which  we  manage under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme.    The
footpath leading to this quiet wildlife meadow runs alongside  the
north  side  of the Railway,  towards Alresford;  train  movements
will  be  seen  clearly from the path and action  photographs  may
quite readily be taken.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On  all  operating days,  you are welcome to visit the  locomotive
yard between 10.30 a.m.  and 4.30 p.m., while access to the engine
sheds  is  by  prior arrangement only,  when it is essential  that
your party has a Watercress Line guide.</P>

brake  compartment  of  any  of our trains.   Such  customers  are
advised  to  start  and  finish their  journeys  at  Alresford  as
platform  access  at Alton is via a footbridge.   Passengers  with
folding wheelchairs and who are sufficiently mobile,  are  welcome
to  travel  in  any  part of the train,  their  wheelchairs  being
carried  in  the brake van.  Ramps are provided to ease  entry  to
trains  and our volunteer station staff will do all  they  can  to
assist less-agile passengers.  A wheelchair is available  at  each
station,   if  required.  There are toilets for  the  disabled  at
Ropley  Station and adjacent to the station car park at Alresford.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Although  for  this Advanced Course prior footplate experience  is
not  essential,   absolute beginners may  find  they  derive  more
benefit and enjoyment by first taking our Introductory Course</P>

    


<P ALIGN="LEFT">This  is  the  ultimate  driving and firing  experience  with  the
engine  working  at full regulator*  over  1  in  60  /  1  in  80
gradients on the Mid-hants Railway.   (<I>The footplate  men  of  old
called this route 'Over The Alps' with good cause</I>)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As  part  of  your  day you will be handling  the  controls  of  a
powerful steam locomotive,  and your engine will be hauling a  set
of coaches, just as with our normal passenger services</P>

<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/dougmikeIntrocourse.jpg" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="240" ALT="course..jpg"></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  will  be  paired with another participant and you  will  take
turns to fire and drive the locomotive,  under the instruction  of
our crew.  We hope you will want to stay with us all day: when you
are not driving or firing you can ride in the coaches,  where  you
may want to discuss the route,  signals and other points with  the
guard.  You might assist with uncoupling,  coupling, taking water,
and  operating the ground frame during shunting.  Each round  trip
takes  about one and half hours,  and you can book  for  just  one
round  trip which costs £250 (<B>including VAT</B>)  or up to a full  day
which is four round trips.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Participants must be between 18 and 75 years of age,  fit,  and in
reasonable health,  i.e.  able to climb to from the footplate by a
vertical flight of steel steps from/to ground level.  We also  ask
that  you  wear the correct clothing - a stout pair  of  boots  or
shoes  is essential (trainers are not acceptable).   Overalls  are
also  required;   we can provide these for you  (f.o.c.)   if  you
prefer.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> It could be on one of the following locomotives:</P>

Ivatt 2-6-2 tank engine  #41312<BR>
Ex-S.R. Class  S15, 4-6-0  #30506<BR>
U-class #31625<BR>
Ex-SR Rebuilt West Country Class 4-6-2   #34016 'Bodmin'<BR>
A visiting locomotive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  will  find pictures and up-to-date news of all these  engines
on  the  Loco  Shed webpages. We'll do our best  to  arrange  your
choice of engine.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  will understand that because these steam locomotives  are  at
least  45 years old they need a lot time for maintenance,   so  we
cannot guarantee a specific locomotive on the day.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For details of visiting engines which may become available,  watch
for Latest News on our website.</P>

     

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Footplate  Experience days operate on selected  mid-week  days  in
Spring and Autumn, and at other times when schedules permit.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  can  also  arrange  courses as a corporate hospitality  event.
Please contact  Rod Wicks (<A HREF="mailto:reservations@watercressline.co.uk">reservations@watercressline.co.uk</A>)   to

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  also run a Footplate Experience Introductory Course for  those
who  would prefer somewhat less driving and firing.   Learning  to
drive  a  powerful steam locomotive is an exhilarating experience,
and  the Mid-hants Railway offers to the inexperienced person  the
opportunity  to  do this over one of the most demanding  lines  in
railway preservation.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This  course  is  a very popular gift and we can  provide  a  gift
voucher,  valid for six months from the date of issue, at no extra
charge.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The charge is  £150  including VAT</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Footplate  Experience  Introductory  Course  includes  safety
instruction and a short tour of the workshops with our  instructor
to  see locomotives under repair and restoration.  Then it's  over
to  the steam locomotive where the participant will drive and crew
the  locomotive,  spending the rest of the course on the footplate
operating the locomotive under instruction.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Note    please     that     no     guests can be conveyed,     and
there are only minimal waiting facilities at  Ropley.   (<B>Alresford
station is  only  a  few  miles  away,   though,   and  there's  a
delightful Georgian town to explore</B>)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Participants must be between 18 and 75 years of age,  fit,  and in
reasonable health,  i.e.  able to climb to from the footplate by a
vertical  flight  of  steel  steps   from/to  ground  level.   The
participant  will  also need to be correctly  dressed  with  stout
boots or shoes,  and overalls for protection, as the footplate can
be  very  hot and dirty.  We can loan a pair of overalls (<I>free  of
charge</I>)   if  you  let us know in advance,  but not  shoes.   N.B.
Trainers  are  not  acceptable.   Our  instructors  cannot  permit
anyone  to  take  part in this course without the  correct  safety
wear.</P>







<P ALIGN="LEFT">These courses offer a choice of morning or afternoon instruction:</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Arrive at Ropley * station at
 0930hr for a morning course, or
 1330hr for an afternoon course</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> * From the A31 at Ropley, near the Toyota garage, go up Station Hill</P>
   

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  can  also  arrange  courses as a corporate hospitality  event.

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mid Hants Railway,  Hampshire's premier steam railway, wanders for
some  ten  miles  through the heart of what was famous  watercress
country.  The Railway acquired the nickname 'Watercress Line' when
transport of that crop by train to all parts of the Country was  a
routine feature of daily life in the area.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Watercress Belle is a first class train of former boat  train
stock  on  which a leisurely five course dinner is  served  during
two  round  trips (<I>approximately forty miles</I>)  of the  line.   Its
maximum capacity is 72 diners.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Watercress is said to be an aphrodisiac;  true or not we make sure
to  feature  it  in  each of our dinners.  A fully  staffed  train
requires  some twenty three volunteers prepared,  simply  for  the
love of their Railway,  to devote their Saturday evening to making
your visit a real pleasure.  Do join us this year;  it will be our
pleasure to serve you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Watercress Belle is available for private hire,   maximum  72
seats.       Let us know your requirements.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
