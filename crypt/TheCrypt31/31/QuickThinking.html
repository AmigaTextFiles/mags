<P ALIGN="LEFT">The man was insistent that the boy ask his manager about the matter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Walking into the back room, the boy said to the manager, <B>"Some asshole wants
to buy half a head of lettuce."</B> As he finished his sentence, he turned to
find the man standing right behind him, so he added, <B>"and this gentleman
kindly offered to buy the other half."</B></P>
