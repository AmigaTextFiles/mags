<CENTER>For gawds sake move over and let me get in,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's not very warm and my nighties quite thin.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Panting and pushing to get him over the line,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I only want half the bed, the part I claim as mine.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>I'm just dozing off to sleep when my calves go in a clamp,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I jump out very quickly 'cos I've got the ruddy cramp.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I can hear my other half snoring well into the land of nod,</CENTER>
<CENTER>While I am limping up and down thinking "<B>You're lucky sod</B>".</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>The cramp is slowly subsiding so I try my luck once again,</CENTER>
<CENTER>More pushing, heaving and shoving he really is a pain.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I close my eyes and let my mind drift like a boat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When suddenly I'm choking with an elbow in my throat.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>After being rudely awakened I settle down once more,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Oh my God! It's started again that never ending snore.</CENTER>
<CENTER>With my head buried in my pillow and the cover over my head,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I've suffered this mighty torture since the first day we were wed.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>I give him a dig to make him stop and turn the other way,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Oh blow me down! Here we go he's taken the whole duvet.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I pull it back with very much force, I have to be quite tough,</CENTER>
<CENTER>So he turns over with it and shoves his knees right up my duff.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>Finally I settle down in hope that I sleep the whole night through,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When suddenly the bedclothes go back, he's got to go to the loo.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I rest upon my elbow, the clock's on half past three,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"<B>Oh Lord, let me get some rest, please be good to me.</B>"</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>My other half gets back to bed shaking me back to life,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I think I deserve a medal for being an understanding wife.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I hear the clock chime four o'clock, I guess God never heard,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I may as well get out of bed and do yesterdays' crossword.</CENTER>
