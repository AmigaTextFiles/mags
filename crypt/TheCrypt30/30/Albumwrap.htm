<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was talking to a fellow surfer at work the other day. He was remarking 
    about the way that some people download songs from the Internet using P2P 
    software.</p>
<p>“Of course, I would never bother to download an individual album track” was 
  one of his comments. I was intrigued………</p>
<p>He explained that he usually downloaded the full album. I had seen whole albums 
  in a single file, but had never bothered to try this way of getting songs.</p>
<p>“You should check out “Albumwrap”, he said……………..so I did!</p>
<p>Albumwrap turns out to be two separate pieces of software.</p>
<p>It comes with the decoder part, which is freeware, and the encoder, which isn’t, 
  as I shall show you.</p>
<p>Albumwrap can be found at <a
href="http://infamus.com/albumwrap/">http://infamus.com/albumwrap/</a></p>
<p>As I said previously, the decoder part known as Albumwrap extractor is free.</p>
<p>The software is available in both Mac (classic and Osx) version and Windows. 
  It says that the software is for Windows 95/8, but I haven’t had any problems 
  using it under M.E., so I also expect it to work under XP.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=361 height=193

<p>The software comes, as a 368k zip file for the windows version, so shouldn’t 
  take long to download even if you are still stuck on modem as I am.</p>
<p>Simply extract the zip anywhere you wish to run the software.</p>
<p>Ok, so now what?</p>
<p>Well, Albumwrap files are usually found on P2P systems and the album title 
  is usually appended with ALBW.</p>
<p>A typical example would be  “Evanescence - Entire Album CD - Fallen_ALBW.mp3”</p>
  <p>I actually downloaded this file, just to try the software…………..I already 
    have bought this CD.</p>
<p>Now to show what this does. The file in question was  64.5 MB, just in case 
  people are wondering…………</p>
<p>Start the decoder…………click the extract album button…………….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=341
src="Images/albumwrap04.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>We now have a requestor asking for a file to be loaded……………</p>
<p>Select the file and ……….. Bingo!</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=370 height=288
src="Images/albumwrap06.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>You can now click Select all……..or tick the checkboxes for whatever tracks 
  you wish…………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=324 height=331
src="Images/albumwrap08.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Select  where you want the files saved and that’s it!</p>
<p>You now have individual mp3 files of all the tracks.</p>
<p>It even saves the information about each track………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=404
src="Images/albumwrap10.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>There, easy peasy!</p>
<p>This means that you can save an awful lot of time searching for a particular 
  album, just download the file and you have it.</p>
  <p>The files play ok after they have been decoded, they even play ok before 
    they have been decoded. Well, it does in WinAmp.</p>
<p>Since its freeware and small, it won’t really matter too much if you decide 
  to keep a copy on your drive, and never use it.</p>
<p>Well worth a try.</p>
<p>The encoder part called simply Albumwrap is shareware. The fee according to 
  the website is $15, so wouldn’t break the Bank either. </p>
<p>You can download a time limited demo of it from the same website. I did download 
  and try, but wiped it after the time ran out, as I didn’t have any need for 
  it.</p>
<p>Same simple interface…………….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=299 height=229
src="Images/albumwrap12.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>Simply add mp3 files, no, it doesn’t encode straight from CD!</p>
<p>Once you’ve added all the files you wish, click the make album button.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=344 height=140
src="Images/albumwrap14.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>Fill in the details and click the wrap album button.</p>
<p>It really can’t get any easier than this, surely………..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=141 height=119
src="Images/albumwrap16.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>Final message, surprisingly………</p>
<p>As I say, a very simple little utility, and may come in handy one day. </p>
  <p>Go forth and download it!</p>
