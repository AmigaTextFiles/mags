<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An old farmer had owned a large farm for several years. He had a large pond 
in the back fixed up nice; picnic tables, horseshoe courts, basketball
court, etc. The pond was properly shaped and fixed up for swimming when it
was built.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he 
hadn't been there for a while, and look it over.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with
glee. As he came closer he saw it was a bunch of young women
skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they
all went to the deep end of the pond.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old man replied,<FONT COLOR=BLUE> "<B>I didn't come down here to watch you ladies
swim or make you get out of the pond naked. I only came to feed
the alligator.</B>"</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLUE>
