<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your Daylily plant is a large clump you should divide it so it can become 
healthier. When it's large and clumped together, the middle of the plant 
cannot get the water and nutrients it needs so it will eventually die out if 
not divided. You may also want more plants in your garden or to give away 
to friends and family.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it is finished flowering, dig up the clump and divide it into many 
plants then re-plant as many as desired. It can sometimes be pretty tough 
to divide a large clump because the roots get tightly woven together -- you 
might have to slice through it with your shovel a few times to loosen the 
clump. Try not to worry about damaging the plant when doing this - Daylilies 
are very tough. As long as you have a piece of root, it will grow into a 
plant. When you are finished planting the divisions, be sure to water 
thoroughly. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you grow your own strawberries, you probably have noticed that runners 
will grow from the main plant and root themselves somewhere nearby. These 
rooted runners are new plants. Simply cut the runner from the main plant to 
the new plant after the new one has rooted and, voila, a new strawberry 
plant. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a variety of strawberry plant that doesn't send off runners but 
instead grows offsets. To propagate this type, simply dig it up after 
harvest, divide into smaller plants, re-plant the offsets and 
water well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you know Daylily flowers are edible? Well, they are. They taste like a 
sweet lettuce and are a tasty, colorful addition to any salad. I like them so 
much I munch a petal almost every time I walk into the garden.</P>
