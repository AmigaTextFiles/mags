<CENTER>I was spotted in a shop window by a little lad who dearly wanted a pet.</CENTER>
<CENTER>His mum said, "Let's take it because it's the last chance that you'll
get".</CENTER>
<CENTER>I think she was fed up with him when he kept on changing his mind,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And as they were both tired I was the best pet they could find.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>So I was taken home with them where they would look after me,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To a lovely hutch in a garden where I could look out and see.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A lot of grass and flowers and loads of tempting carrot tops too,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was dying to get out to smell it all and have a really good chew.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>After a while they let me out to explore and have a good hop round,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I spotted a big fat doe, or so I thought, sitting on the ground.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I climbed on her and rolled straight off I could not get a grip,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Three times I tried but each time I fell off I felt a proper drip.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>I was only trying to woo her but I didn't have much luck,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I heard the dad shout out "<B>It wants lessons from a buck</B>".</CENTER>
<CENTER>I didn't know what he was talking about and then I heard him call,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"<B>Come and look at this daft rabbit it is trying to court a ball</B>".</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>The family were laughing at my antics and said that they would go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>In the car to the nearest pet shop to see if they could get me a doe.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I have a girlfriend living with me now but that's not the end you see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The next day they found she was pregnant and it is definitely not by me.</CENTER>
