<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The war on spam has so far been waged on two fronts:
legislation to make spam illegal and filters that prevent spam
reaching its destination.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But neither approach has worked.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if US anti-spam laws succeeded, they would not
stop spam that originates outside the US. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for spam filters, the spammers are constantly devising new
ways to defeat them. The people who are really being affected
by the filters are web marketers with legitimate optin lists - how
many of your subscribers are receiving your newsletter?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But now, two researchers at IBM - Scott Fahlman and Mark
Wegman - have come up with a completely different approach.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea is very simple.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Software located between your email client and your server
would intercept all incoming email. The software would contain
a 'white list' of email addresses that you want to receive email
from.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any incoming email that is not recognized by your 'white list'
would be bounced back to the sender with a message directing
the sender to a website where they could purchase a 'charity stamp'
for a small fee - between 5 and 25 cents.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proceeds would go to charity. The charity stamp would be a
10-digit code that allows the email to pass through the software to
your email client.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This would kill spam almost overnight.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Why?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because spammers have an extremely low conversion rate - as
little as one sale for every 10,000 emails. But that doesn't worry them,
because they send millions of emails at a time - and it costs them
nothing. Now multiply 2 million emails by 5 cents per email - Joe Spam
is out of business!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flood of spam that is now choking up the Internet only proves
what economists have long been saying - any resource that is free
and unregulated becomes exploited to the point where no one can
use it anymore.</P>
