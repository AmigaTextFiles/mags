<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to hire them was brought  on  by  a
recent documentary on how Scottish youths were able to remove
a  set  of car wheels in less than 6 seconds using a <B>shifter</B>,
a <B>4lb club hammer</B>, a <B>crow bar</B> and a
<B>baseball bat</B>,  whereas Ferrari's existing crew can only do it in 8
seconds with  millions  of  dollars  worth of high-tech  gear.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  was thought to be an excellent yet bold move by Ferrari Management.
As most races  are won and lost  in  the  pits,  Ferrari would have an
advantage  over  every team. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However Ferrari  got more than they bargained for as,  during the Scottish
crew's first  practice session,  not only were the new pit crew  able  to
change the tyres  in  under  6  seconds,  but  within  12  seconds  they 
had resprayed, rebadged,  and had sold the vehicle over to the McLaren
Team  for four dozen cans  of Tennents Super Lager,  a carton of Embassy
Red cigarettes and a quick glimpse of Coulthard's bird in the shower.</P>
