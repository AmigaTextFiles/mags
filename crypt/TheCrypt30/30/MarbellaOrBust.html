<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back in the cold damp days of January, all managers were called to a
conference in
Birmingham.  Assuming it was just for our area, consisting of 13 managers
and an area
manager, we made arrangements for travelling, expecting a reprimand for
overspending or
mis-managing from senior management.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imagine our surprise when we arrived to find the managers from all the
different areas there
too.  Intrigued, we speculated over coffee amongst ourselves, and sought out
friends from
other areas, who seemed equally mystified.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gathering was called to order and we filed into the conference hall to
be enlightened.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first item on the agenda was the presentation of an industry award,
which was a
remarkable achievement in itself.  There were several speakers explaining
how the criteria for
the award was assessed with videos from the individual stores which took
part.  The chief
assessor gave us a synopsis before presenting the award.  Many photos were
taken and copies
of the certificate were given to all present to display in their stores.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rest of the morning was taken up with financial reports and a review on
the initiatives
which commenced at our annual conference, and a new one was introduced.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By now, we were getting a little puzzled as the annual manager's conference
incorporates all
this type of information, and we have never had a mid-year conference
before.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we took a lunch recess, they announced details of the location of the
annual
conference.  Each year, managers are invited to the conference which has
been held in a
different part of the country every time.  Last year was Blackpool, the
previous year was in a
golf hotel near Chester.  Former locations have been Oasis in Penrith and
Blackpool in a
smaller hotel.  The hotels have to be large enough to cater for around 400
people, as
supplier's representatives also join in and give presentations on their new
products and
initiatives, and they have been sumptuous, and superior each year.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Videos were shown of various places which had been considered, before
showing the final
choice - Butlin's in Skegness.  We were to take over a large part of the
complex for three days
for the conference and team building exercises.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the break for lunch, many expressed their surprise and disappointment
regarding the
choice.  Some were grateful for the chance of a free break from work, with
friends and good
food and accommodation for free.  Still, this was a senior management
decision - who were
we to argue?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After lunch, we settled down again for the final part of the conference,
discussing results from
management forums, staff consultation groups, and new I.T. progress and
procedures.  It was
a very interesting afternoon, culminating in a questions and answers session
between us and
the senior management.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Managing Director had the final word summarising the day's main points,
and then
remarked on the amount of negative comments concerning the location of the
annual
conference he had overheard during lunch.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He invited us to state what we would like from a conference, which were duly
written down.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suggestions were such as :</P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Sun</B><BR>
<B>Good food</B><BR>
<B>Fun</B><BR>
<B>Good accommodation</B><BR>
<B>Ease of travel</B><BR>
<B>Cheaper drinks</B><BR>
<B>More free time</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a brief resume of the above, the senior management then said we might
like to watch
another video, and the room darkened once more.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was a fabulous presentation of a luxurious hotel, in an exotic
location - Marbella, Spain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After it was finished, we were asked if this was what we had in mind.  With
free travel from
a local airport, connecting transport, free drinks and food, and two days
free time to explore
Marbella and an free optional trip to Puerto Banus, and all the hotel
amenities at our disposal
with guaranteed sun and fun, who wouldn't have been happy?  All we had to do
was to
arrange cover for the stores, and supply a passport!  It was the company's
way of thanking us
and acknowledging the success of a good year's trade, and the award.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were still reeling as we left to make our way home, not sure if we had
actually heard
correctly.  Was it an April Fool's joke?  This was January - they were a
little early with their
joke.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next few weeks, it became very clear that it was indeed true, and
no joke.  Passport
applications and instructions were distributed, with free checking provided
by the Post Office
stores, and hotel brochures were handed out.  I was going to Marbella,
Spain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next few weeks were a flurry of passport applications, and photos,
submitting passport
numbers and names, and arranging cover for the store.  The staff were
envious, of course, but
were happy to cover for three days in June.  I have never had the
opportunity to travel
abroad and was quite excited at the prospect.  Our area manager teased those
who were
worried about flying, quite mercilessly, and was disappointed that I
appeared happy at the
prospect.  I had always wanted a chance to fly, so I was not going to allow
him to put me off.
After all,, if you haven't tried something, you can't be frightened of it.
The return might be a
problem, if I found I was airsick or panicked on take-off or landing, but I
was willing to take
that chance.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there was the delicious chance to choose a "posh frock" for the Gala
Dinner - something
special for Spain, and some smart and casual clothes for a hot climate as
well.  A woman's
delight.  A rummage through the wardrobe and cupboards found some items to
use, too.
The suitcase was theoretically packed by February!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a mad flurry collecting the relevant documents together - why can
you never find
your birth certificate when you need it?  Obtaining a duplicate seemed a
saner option to me,
and was a fairly painless exercise.  There was panic regarding the passport,
made worse for
myself, as somehow the Post Office mislaid one document, and when packed, I
posted the
wrong one.  Many phone calls to and from the Passport Office arguing about
it, finally
resulted in the documents and Passport being supplied.  They were correct,
as the wrong
document had been supplied by me, but there was no sign of the correct one
anywhere.  Still,
I had a passport, time to worry about that later.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Travel arrangements were made to the airport, and the company would take us
on from
there.  The time dragged through to the end of May, and suddenly we were
into June.  The
last few days were spent checking we had everything ready and finished at
the store and at
home, making life easier for those left behind.  A lift to the "base store"
to meet up and we
were off for a conference with a difference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The atmosphere at the airport was electric.  We checked in and made our way
up to
departure, meeting up with others as we went.  A few coffees and cigarettes
for the nervous,
with more than a few butterflies in stomachs, we chatted the time away
waiting for the call to
board the plane.  One or two were uneasy about flying, being teased by our
area manager,
and getting worried.  The rest were excited and restless.  We were called to
board on schedule
and we embarked on the plane which we had exclusive use of.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My daughter lived in Cyprus for two years, and had given advice on the
flight.  I was more
excited than nervous - after all, if she could do it at 20, then I should be
able to at double that!
Take-off was exactly as she had described and the view from the window was
amazing.  It is
quite astonishing how quickly you ascend and the world shrinks away.  Within
minutes we
were leaving England and heading toward France, with cabin crew supplying us
with food
and drinks to pass the time.  Before long, France disappeared beneath cloud
and then we
could catch glimpses of the sea.  When the cloud finally cleared, we were
over Spain, and I
marvelled at the change of colour of the terrain.  England had been green,
France had been
green and brown, and green, grey and orange are the colours of Spain.  The
sun was bright
and hot through the plane window and the adventure had begun.  Before long
we began to
descend and we tried to make out where the airport was.  Finally the captain
announced we
would be landing shortly and to fasten our seatbelts ready.  The landing was
as good as the
flight had been and before long we were standing in sunny Spain, two and a
half hours after
leaving an overcast Britain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a long walk to luggage reclaim in Malaga airport, and the
temperature was in the
high 80s.  We all streamed through to collect our luggage from the carousel
and then to board
coaches for the onward travel to Marbella.  The coaches were thankfully
air-conditioned and
cool when we were making the 40 minute drive to Marbella, which passed
quickly whilst we
were reading the welcome brochure and discussing the table plan for the Gala
Dinner.  We
are all buzzing with excitement, and anticipation.  On arrival at the hotel,
which is situated
half-way up a mountain, we were to find our room keys in envelopes on tables
in reception
and could make our way to our rooms to unpack and settle in, before
returning to reception
for drinks and food should we wish.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far things had gone extremely smoothly, except for our departure from the
coach, a little
too premature!  The coach had stopped, and the doors opened, and as my
room-mate and I
were directly opposite the centre door, we stepped off, leading the way for
everyone else.
Someone started shouting in Spanish, and stopped the others from getting off
the coach,
whilst we stood and stared, puzzled. Finally, someone explained in English
that the coach
would stop outside a different door where tables were set up with the key
envelopes, whilst
the luggage was removed from the coach.  We had to walk - all of 20 yards!
When we arrived
at the door, most people had already found their envelopes, so our's were
easy to find.  We
grabbed our luggage and opened the envelopes to find - everything except
keys!  It took two
trips to reception to obtain keys, then we could go to our room.  More fun
ensued when
trying to open the door.  After one of us had tried four or five times to
open it, the other
tried.  Eventually, I got a little cross and shoved my shoulder into the
door, and I flew into
the room.   After much giggling, we eventually found out how I did it.  It
took several
practices before we became confident we could get in, especially after a
drink or two.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rooms had twin beds and we all shared with another manager from our
area.  We have
known each other for quite some time now, and all get along together well.
A quick
examination of the accommodation and unpack the suitcases, changing to suit
the climate to
feel more comfortable, and a clean up in the en-suite bathroom, before
relaxing on the balcony
for a short while, drinking in the view.  It is now mid-afternoon, and Spain
is at it's hottest
part of the day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It transpired that we were not the only ones without a key, or the ability
to get in.  We
helped a few "break in" to their rooms before we went back downstairs to
meet the rest of our
team.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We joined the others in reception at the coffee bar, and had the first of
many free drinks.  We
had been issued with an "all-inclusive" ticket in the envelope which enabled
us to sample all
the refreshments and food available.  The food was excellent and wonderfully
presented,
ordering drinks proved a little difficult for some, as both sides found it
hard to understand
each other.  I had had a few lessons in Spanish phases in the weeks prior to
the trip, and
helped out where possible.  I have since gained more knowledge of Spanish
during my stay,
which proved helpful when visiting Puerto Banus and Marbella.  I am very
grateful to the
Spanish staff for their patience and assistance with my attempts to massacre
their language.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before long, I had to put my "all-inclusive" card to the test in getting
food.  The pasta salad
on the plane had been tasty, but small, and I was feeling very hungry.  I
found the restaurant
with ease and helped myself from the buffet.  Finding a seat was easy, as
there were few
people there, and I ate with pleasure.  There was a wide variety of food
available, and over
the next few days I tried many dishes.  I found nothing unappetising at all.
I was only
challenged once by the staff with regard to the "all-inclusive" card, which
was during my first
meal.  Once it was shown, I could continue eating and they seemed to
remember me, as I
was never asked again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For drinks, you had to sign a receipt with your room number on, which tended
to slow down
the queue somewhat.  Not the easiest way to obtain a drink when there are
around 500 guests
all waiting to be served, with the obvious language/accent barriers!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was an informal barbecue on the terrace by the pool on the first night
which maintained
the standards of food.  I had to feel sorry for the chef.  The queue for
food stretched down to
the pool with crowds around the buffet tables, with the chef in the centre
with the barbecue.
He must have thought the queue would never end, and all the time, he sweats!
It was a very
warm night and the terrace was covered, so heat was building all the time.
After most of us
had eaten we were entertained by an excellent traditional Spanish
performance.  How they
managed to find the energy in that heat I cannot say.  Then we went on to
the night club to
dance the rest of the night away.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After finding there was no more room on the dance floor, I wandered in
search of friends
who had vanished seeking the toilets.  As the hotel is vast, it was easy to
get lost until you
found your bearings.  I failed to find the friends who had disappeared, but
found others
sitting in the relative cool of the reception area, so settled down with
those for a while, until I
found out that my room-mate had retired due to over-indulgence and was
relying on me to
wake her up in the morning at 7 o'clock sharp.  There was no clock in the
room (presumably,
the hotel consider that you are on holiday, with no need to wake early), and
my watch had
no alarm.  How was I going to wake?  At home, a combination of alarm and
much nudging
from other half sometimes fails.  Sudden inspiration - an alarm call.
Having booked the call, I
decided to retire, as it was now 1 o'clock, the flight and the vino collapso
having taken their
toll.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bed was very comfortable and it seemed no time at all before the phone
rang to wake me.
I woke my room mate and sat on the balcony for a while watching the world
wake up.  It was
still fairly dark, and the lights were still lit in the town.  As I watched,
the lights went out one
by one and soon voices and traffic could be heard in the distance.  Outside
was as warm as
the air-conditioned room and very pleasant.  Just a pity there was no coffee
making facilities
in the room, as coffee first thing on the balcony would have been a treat.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A quick wash and we're ready to face breakfast.  Plenty of choices were
available, but many
people were obviously suffering from the night before, taking the
alternative English breakfast
choice - coffee, fruit juice and paracetamol.   Being British, we were a
noisy lot over breakfast,
shameful, considering there were more than a few hangovers amongst us.
Finally, we drifted
toward the conference room, to find seats ready for the serious part of the
excursion.  The
room was fully air conditioned, and a welcome respite from the Spanish heat,
which was
already beginning to mount, although after a time, it began to feel chilly.
The subject matter
coupled with over indulgence and lack of sleep usually finds it's victims.
Several were
spotted taking a nap during the less entertaining periods!  Our area manager
was absent for
the greater part of the morning, having enjoyed "orange juice with a
mysterious kick" the
previous afternoon, despite grim warnings to all of us about the demon
alcohol.  He suffered
much ribbing about it for the rest of the conference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were many laughs during the conference, and there was a Spanish theme
to link the
different presentations and guest speakers - Manuel from Fawlty Towers
(Farty Towels).
Before the mid-morning break, we were asked to view some out-takes and vote
for our
choices.  These were very funny.  Then we were out on the hotel lawn for
coffee and biscuits,
for around an hour.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reconvened for a further hour, and then we were free to do as we pleased.
A trip to
Puerto Banus had been arranged for the afternoon for those who wished to go,
so after a
quick change of clothes after lunch, around 120 delegates boarded three
coaches bound for the
playground of the rich.  Once we arrived, we were free to explore for two
and a half hours.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Puerto Banus - the Millionaire's Playground - full of multi-million pound
yachts, fast, flashy
cars and and multi-nationals.  We marvelled at the yachts moored in the
marina, one was
absolutely huge, with four decks.  Many speculated on it's price, all I know
was the contents
of my house could have fitted into it several times over.  Of course, when
you have the
money for yachts like these, you have to have the car to match.  Open-topped
Mercedes were
common, with the likes of Porche, Ferrari, Masserati, and Lotus evident.
Not a beat up old
banger among them.  The views over the bay were fabulous and we watched
yachts coming
and going for a while, before browsing in the many shops along the esplanada
and plazas.  T-
shirts were in my price range, so souvenirs were bought to take home.  With
the Euros, you
could have a spending spree, with everything imaginable on offer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tired of the town, I walked down onto the beach to at least paddle in the
Mediterranean.
The temperature had risen to 34 degrees, and the sea felt cold, when,
sandals off, I paddled.
No-one had warned me that walking back up the beach with bare wet feet was
not
recommended!  It was like walking on hot coals, with the ensuing zig-zag hop
up the beach
using the shade from sunshade to sunshade.  A strip of carpet laid out on
the beach looked
very welcome, but this too was very hot.  I kept moving up to the decking,
which I was
hoping was cooler, but - no.  It was just as hot.  The hop had become a mad,
painful dash as
I could see a tiled floor ahead.  Tiles equal cool.  Not in Spain.  A few
more yards before
finally I found a shaded area of tiles cool enough upon which to rest.
Blistered feet anyone?
Others were walking quite casually barefoot on the beach, I cannot think how
they could
appear so comfortable.  It was a relief to put the sandals back on, once
excess sand had been
removed.  The feet were dry - boiled dry.  I wandered further before meeting
up with others,
moving back to the pick up point.  I didn't see any rich or famous there,
but I confess not to
have been looking for them.  The chances are I had passed them without
recognition, I was
more interested in the sights.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arriving back in the hotel, I went down to the pool for a swim in one of the
pools.  Due to
the temperature, the water felt cold, but once in, it was pleasurable.  I
have not had the
experience of swimming outdoors before, so this was another first for me.
Basking in the sun
afterward dried me off quickly, then it was back to the room to change for
the Gala Dinner.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whilst we wait for the food to be served, we were given the Best of.....
awards.  These were
all sponsored by the main supplier for each area of store, and were awarded
to the best store
displays and performance in each section.  We have a long way to go before
our store gets
among the winners.  It was good to see that a few stores from my area were
awarded.  The
final award is for the Store of the Year, and, to our delight, a store from
our area won!  The
manager receives £5000 and a free trip to the international conference in
South Africa next
year.  We ended up celebrating with champagne, courtesy of both the area and
regional
managers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Awards over, we ate our meal and then were treated to a performance from
staff members
who had formed to create a vocal group.  They were excellent, and thoroughly
enjoyed giving
their performance as much as we appreciated their efforts.  They were
finally allowed to leave
the stage after several encores around midnight.  For those who still had
the energy, the night
continued with a disco, but most had retired to their rooms by then.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The conference was almost over.  Just the morning left in Spain, and then
the flight back early
afternoon, landing back in Britain by 6pm.  Of course, the main thing on
everyone's mind the
following morning was to purchase some cigarettes to take back.  At Spanish
prices, they
worked out at around half the price.  There was just one slight problem -
cigarettes in Spain
are vended from machines in single packets, and although these machines are
plentiful, with
around 400 delegates, they could soon be empty.  A shop needed to be found.
Not that easy
as we found that Marbella was closed that day for a local fiesta.  The only
place you can buy
multiple packets in Marbella is a tobacconist, and the shop was not opening
that day.  Only
one thing left - duty free at the airport.  Still, it gave us an opportunity
to wander around
Marbella town in the relative cool of the early morning (24 degrees).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After an hour, we made our way back to the hotel to finish packing and relax
prior to the
flight.  All too soon, our coaches had arrived to take us to the airport and
we were on our
way home.  As the computers had crashed in Malaga airport, we were hoping we
could
remain in Spain longer, but unfortunately, although we were delayed, things
can still be done
manually, and we were soon called to board.  Clutching our duty frees, we
fought our way
on, squabbling over window seats, or sitting next to friends.  Finally, all
seated, we were
ready to depart.  My seat was the window seat at the very rear of the plane,
and I spent
much of the flight with my head pressed to the window watching the landscape
glide past.
This time, there were very little clouds to hinder the view, even over
France.  There was
patchy cloud over Britain, but little to spoil the view.  Landing was smooth
and the return
journey had seemed much quicker.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seemed no time at all until we were waiting for transport from the
airport to home.  It had
been a wonderful experience, and I can't see how next year's conference will
match it, much
less beat it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next year?  Well, it will probably be Butlin's in Skegness, and it will be
fun - just not as
spectacular as this year's.  We will be just as keen to get together again
and celebrate each
other's successes.  Here's to next year - cheers!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of where next year's conference will be, I would very much like
to return to Spain
someday.  The little I saw has whetted the appetite and I would like to see
more of the
country and a little less of the tourist areas, and I would certainly like
to travel by plane again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work seems a little less important these days, particularly when I spot a
plane overhead,
whenever I go outside to move rubbish or equipment.  Where ever it's going,
I stop to hope
they enjoy the flight and their holiday as much as we did, and remember my
first trip abroad.</P>
