financial dreams come true. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that building a website to sell products and 
services is not the easiest way to make a living online. A lot 
of specific knowledge or money will be required to be successful 
with a standard website.</P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You must acquire skills --- or pay someone who already 
possesses those skills --- in the following areas:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When this is understood, most people throw their hands up in 
frustration and walk away from their entrepreneurial desires. </P>

<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More people than I can count are making a successful living 
online, and none of them own their own website or send a single 
commercial email to anyone.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">How is this possible?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Ebay</B> covers all of the difficult technical issues. And more 
importantly, Ebay already has floods of visitors eager to 
purchase your wares.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Ebay</B> has provided everything you need to operate a successful 
business online with three exceptions:</P>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>CHOOSING THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS</U></B></P>
<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Before choosing your products, you should ask yourself what you 
enjoy the most. You may enjoy cats, NASCAR or even antiques. 
You should select products consistent with what you enjoy for 
two reasons. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">First, you bring to your presentation a real appreciation for 
the products your are offering. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Secondly, a job you hate is one you will quit. A job you enjoy 
doing will be one that you will want to keep forever. If you 
are starting your own business, the hope is that you will be 
doing it for a very long time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I personally know people who have generated a nice living on 
<B>Ebay</B> selling cat-related items, NASCAR memorabilia and antiques.</P>
<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>FINDING THE ACTUAL PRODUCTS TO SELL</U></B></P>
<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I recommend against diving in and spending thousands of dollars 
buying products that you may or may not be able to sell. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A drop-shipper is a middleman who is willing to permit you to 
buy an individual product, and then they will put your business 
name on the return address of the product package and handle 
the actual delivery for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">By utilizing a drop-shipper, you can speed product delivery to 
the client without risking your own cash to keep a product in 
inventory.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are lost as to how to find a drop-shipper, consider 
subscribing to the drop-shippers directory:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> <A HREF="http://thePhantomWriters.com/drop-shippers_directory.html">http://thePhantomWriters.com/drop-shippers_directory.html</A></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Through this site, you can get all of the information you need 
to find drop-shippers from which you can order over 500,000 
products from over 1,000 brand names.</P>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>LEARNING TO LIST YOUR PRODUCTS AT EBAY</U></B></P>
<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Learning to use Ebay is pretty easy and straightforward. Ebay 
has put forward a lot of effort to help people to become 
successful. For example, Ebay has an entire area of their site 
devoted to the online entrepreneur. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To get an overview of all of the services and tools that Ebay 
provides to sellers, you may visit:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ebay also delivers courses and strategies to help you to be 
more successful:</P>

<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>THE IMPORTANCE OF CASH FLOW TO YOUR SUCCESS</U></B></P> 
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/fistfullcash.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="70" ALT="fistfullcash.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ebay provides tools for both buyers and sellers to rate one 
another. The speed of delivery is one of the most important 
factors that sellers are rated on. By providing quick delivery, 
your buyers will give you a good rating --- and more shoppers 
will bid on your products.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ebay recently purchased PayPal.com to help facilitate purchases 
for their buyers and sellers, and they have integrated the two 
systems together. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, getting the money from your PayPal account to 
your personal account generally takes four days. Even with a 
merchant account, the time gap is nearly the same. This time gap 
expands the turn-around between the transaction and delivery of 
the product unless you take action to speed the process.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you were doing high volume, you would want to minimize the 
handling of a transaction to reduce the chance for a foul-up 
and to increase your ratings within the Ebay system.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But how can this be accomplished?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">While you could rely upon credit cards to get the job done, it 
is not something I would recommend. Paying credit card interest 
rates to process your customer's purchase, is an unnecessary 
burden.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, put a sum of money into a dedicated bank account with 
a debit card attached to it. When you verify a transaction has 
been credited to your PayPal account, then use your debit card 
to immediately process the order with your drop-shipper. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But, how can you do it this way on a tight budget?</P>

<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Let me ask you this. Do you have a 401(k) account?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Experts advise that you not touch your retirement savings for 
anything other than retirement income. That is good advice. 
Fortunately, it is possible under special circumstances to 
acquire loans against your 401(k) accounts.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Beginning in 2002, even the self-employed small business owner 
with no employees could open his or her own 401(k), called a 
solo-owner 401(k), and borrow from it just as employees with 
big companies can. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Weigh this option against the others available to you. It only 
makes sense to take out a loan rather than to take a hit in 
heavy taxes and penalties for drawing your retirement money 
early. Seriously, consider taking advantage of our historically 
low interest rates to meet your cash flow needs.</P>

401(k), please visit: </P>

<BR>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is wise to choose your new business venture based on a model 
that has proven itself over the long-term. Ebay has been proving 
its concept since 1995; helping thousands of people build a 
successful and very profitable business. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time to act is now. Choose the product line that will give 
you the most satisfaction and then get busy. Your success awaits 
you.</P>
