  <p>Summer time again……………</p>
<p>Time to lie back and think of days gone by while drowsing in the sunshine………</p>
<p>I was doing something similar the other day, when I remembered using WordWorth 
  and Office 6 on the Amiga.</p>
<p>I used to love that suite, and, although I now use Microsoft Office at work 
  and at home, I still think back fondly to <span class=GramE>the those</span> 
  days when I used to sweat to get it to display properly with all the patches 
  etc. that were on my faithful miggy.</p>
<p>            Occasionally you find that you miss something from those days, 
  and an organiser type program is one of these. I still use Remdate via emulation 
  because of this………</p>
<p>Then my latest brainwave occurred to me, I thought back and dimly remembered 
  seeing that Digita had released “Organiser” on the P.C.</p>
<p>Next time <span class=GramE>online,</span> and I had noted down the details 
  I could think of about it.</p>
<p>A quick search via Google revealed that “Organiser” was still available on 
  P.C. ……………</p>
<p>The URL is <a href="http://www.sover.net/~who1/apps.html">HTTP://www.sover.net/~who1/apps.html</a>  
</p>
<p>Guess the next part…………           <span>J</span></p>
<p> <img border=0 width=348 height=371
src="Images/organiser002.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
<p>Yup, from the URL, you can download a free version of Organiser!!!!</p>
<p>The page also gives you a registration code to prevent the “nag” requesters!!!!</p>
<p>I should also point out that the registration code came from Digita ……..this 
  isn’t pirate gear!</p>
<p>            Organiser is the same layout that was on the version that was on 
  the “Office” suite, so old Amiga users need not fear.</p>
<p>The program works as well as it ever did and another of my needs has now been 
  satisfied.</p>
<p>            So, what does it actually do, just in case you aren’t an Amiga 
  user?</p>
<p>            Organiser is exactly what it says, a computer equivalent of a filofax.</p>
<p>You get an up to date calendar………..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>You also get the address book part………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p><span class=GramE>The scheduler (or should that be tasks?)</span>……………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>The diary part……….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>And it even has supplements……..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>In putting to the program could not be easier. Simply double click on the part 
  of the “page” you wish to add anything and you get the usual box to fill in.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=383 height=233
src="Images/organiser014.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p><span class=GramE>Same for all the other parts, such as new addresses etc.</span></p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=341
src="Images/organiser016.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=341
src="Images/organiser018.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>The program does a lot more than I really need, but then again, you never know 
  when it will come in handy.</p>
<p>For instance, in the address part, you can choose to view everything in different 
  ways like this……</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser020.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>Or another way to get to the part of the program that you wish to access………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=456
src="Images/organiser022.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p><span class=GramE>Like to know more about working the program (simple though 
  it is)?</span></p>
<p> <img border=0 width=434 height=428
src="Images/organiser024.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>Yup, even a fully laid help on the menu.</p>
<p>You should read the terms and conditions, of course………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=445
src="Images/organiser026.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>I think you’ll find that there is nothing really startling in the terms, though.</p>
<p>This program is very nice (as was the version on Amiga) and I have had this 
  on my drive for a few months now without any failures.</p>
<p>Does exactly what it says with no fuss, and very little additional thought.</p>
<p>Of course, people might wish for one that mail merges addresses, auto dials 
  numbers etc, but would you get them for free…….and would they be as reliable 
  as this has proved?</p>
<p>Most things you wish to do with this program can be achieved by the icons on 
  the menu strip and it can have as many files (or different users as you like).</p>
<p>It still has the “fortune cookies”…….. Remember them?</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=414 height=280
src="Images/organiser028.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>And reminders will show up when the program starts…………….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=338 height=215
src="Images/organiser030.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>If you’re nostalgic …..Or just want a small diary and address book; this could 
  be a Godsend.</p>
  <p>Give it a try and, you probably will like this one.  </p>
