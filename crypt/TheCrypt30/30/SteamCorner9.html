<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hello again. This time out, we're going to take a look at few more narrow gauge 
railways in other parts of the U.K., with a glimpse at the infrastructure that 
provides the permanent way for our railway system, and a means for loco-men 
to "read the road".</P>

<B>Launceston Steam Railway, Cornwall.</B><BR>
The railway has been constructed upon the trackbed of the old Waterloo / Exeter 
/ Wadebridge / Padstow route, covering two miles along the  River Kensey 
valley.  Utilising locos that spent their lives in North Wales slate quarries, the 
line possesses a veritable collection of buildings and fixtures with histories of 
their own.  The booking office/cafe originally started out in life as a bungalow in 
Cranley - on show at the first Ideal Homes Exhibition of 1919!  The nearby 
British Engineering Exhibition is also worthy of close attention.<BR>
The intention is to eventually extend the line to New Mills, so pay a visit if you 
can - it could make the difference!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sittingbourne & Kemsley Light Railway.</B><BR>
Built in 1906 to convey pulp and produce of a paper mill, the line demonstrates 
original locos still in use.<BR>
<BR>
Train services are daily except for Saturdays from Whitsun to September; <BR>
Tuesdays and Sundays from Easter.  <B>Tel: 01566 775665</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bure Valley Railway, Norfolk.</B><BR>
Opened in1990, and the longest miniature railway constructed in Britain since 
the 1920's at 9 miles, the line links Wroxham and Aylesham.  A fine array of 
18th century houses surround the market square in Aylesham; a site of great 
interest for historians.<BR>
The 15 " gauge line is constructed on the trackbed of the previous Great Eastern 
branch line between Wroxham and County School, which had been closed 
finally in the early 1980's, and is styled in the image of Indian narrow gauge 
railways. <BR>
<BR>
Services run Easter to October (half-term) most days, and Santa specials.  For 
further details, ring <B>01263 733858</B>.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway, Cumbria.</B><BR>
Opened in 1875 to serve Haematite mines, the railway and mines it served were 
beleaguered by financial problems until 1913.  Known affectionately as the 
"Ratty", the line was leased by Northampton model engineer W.J. Bassett-
Lowke; reduced in gauge to 15" from 3', and re-opened for tourist and stone 
traffic. Though the fortunes of the line have fluctuated since, it's future seems 
well secured by the tourist trade of the Lake District.<BR>
Ravenglass station, a three platformed affair, boasts the first signal-box to be 
fitted with radio signalling in Britain, and the line holds much of interest to a 
tourist.<BR> 
<BR>
The service is daily from Easter to October, and weekends in February and 
November.  <B>Tel: 01229 717171</B><BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, that just about concludes the narrow gauge section; a fascinating aspect of 
railway operation, and a must-see with the tourism trade. Now for a look at one 
or two aspects of the infrastructure to be found on the railways, and the effect 
on the footplate crews.</P>

<B>The Development of Trackwork</B><BR>
In the beginning when motive power was no more than a horse, track was of a 
wooden construction; the running rails being in the shape of an "L" in section. 
This was idealic in mining situations, where any trace of sparks could prove 
fatal. This harmonious construction was to be short-lived, however, due to an 
upsurge in demand for produce, which required a steam engine to pull the ever-
heavier loads. These primitive machines literally ripped the track assunder, due 
to the effect of piston movement and weight on the flimsy trackwork.<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An answer was to be found using iron rails of the same profile - as existing 
wooden rails failed, iron sections replaced them, but the ride on these tracks 
would have been most disturbing due in part to excessive lateral movement. 
Many other permutations in design followed, but the most effective was found 
to be a metal rail placed upon wooden sleepers, with the flange borne on the 
wheel rim. The more familiar design of "bull-head" rail sitting in a cast iron chair 
which mounted on a wooden sleeper was finally developed,  and proved itself 
most satisfactory on the British network until the advent of firstly flat bottomed 
rail, and then continuously welded rail, spring clipped to concrete sleepers. To 
allow for expansion a sliding joint had to be utilised due to the welded 
constructional length of track sections, compared to 48 feet lengths joined by 
fishplates and nuts and bolts on the earlier types.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are some things which don't change. Points, crossings, and slips 
(a crossing incorporating either one or two points for constrictive areas) are still 
constructed from flat bottomed rail, mounted on cast chairs screwed to wood. 
This provides an ease of assembly and repair to a sometimes complex piece of 
trackwork.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Gradient Posts </B>- These were designed to give adequate warning to the crew of 
an immanent gradient on the line.  The post would indicate either a climb or 
descent by the angle of the arm from the vertical mounting post, the number 
upon it meaning the amount of feet covered longitudinally for a climb of one 
foot. Depending on rise or drop, water level in the boiler had to be altered to 
prevent damage to the loco. The updating of motive power has reduced the 
significance of these signs somewhat, but when steam was all, had an "Achilles 
heel" effect on firemen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Bridge Plates</B> - The usual usage of these was in a set of three per bridge, two 
being visible in both directions for rail traffic, and one for roadways. In the latter 
case, Engineer's Line Reference, Bridge Number, and milage from the primary 
terminus or start of branch. In the case of a suffix letter being included, this 
donated that the structure had been built well after the line had been completed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Speed Restrictions</B> - These signs are to be found where the complexity of 
trackwork or tightness of radii, or a repair of permanent way require. Both York 
and Crewe stations are good examples of this. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So again do we come to the end of another Steam Corner, and I'll close this one 
with a brief report of 6201 Princess Elizabeth presenting a fine face for preserved 
steam on the West Coast Main Line, having been routed from Euston down the 
Northampton line. At Rugby, the Merseyside Express was timed as 17mins. 
34secs. late, and at Nuneaton some 23mins. late. It is evident that the crew 
made a sterling job of re-gaining time from there in, as the charter arrived 
10mins. early in Liverpool. Another fine and fitting testament to Sir William 
Stannier, the preservation society responsible, and least but not all, 6201, 
Princess Elizabeth, herself.</P>
