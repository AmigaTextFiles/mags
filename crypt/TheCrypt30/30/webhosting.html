<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you find this question silly? Well, ever since I've
started selling web hosting services
(<A HREF="http://www.byteswebhosting.com">http://www.byteswebhosting.com</A>), I've discovered that a
majority of people think that once you've designed a
website, everybody should be able to see it and it should
come in the search engines. When I tell them that in order
to show their "web pages to the world in general they have
to host the pages on a publicly accessible server, there is
a long drawn out blank.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Web hosting is a service that allows users to post Web pages
to the Internet. A web host, or hosting service, is a
business that provides the technologies and services needed
for websites to be viewed on the web.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To understand web hosting properly, we need to understand
what actually the Internet is. The Internet is a network of
millions of interconnected computers. In computer
terminology, when many computers are connected by a cable or
something to work together as a single system, it becomes a
network. It can be a LAN (local area network) or WAN (wide
area network). So if there are A, B, C, , X, Y, Z computers
connected to the network, then the person sitting at
computer A can access computer P (according to the access
granted to that person by the almighty systems
administrator) and P can access A and so on. In this way,
people can share resources such as software, printers, etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, A can only access P and P can only access T if all of
them are connected to the network. M can read a document
stored in S only if M and S belong to the network.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, how does A know that it is accessing P and not K? Every
computer in the network is assigned a unique number and the
computer is accessed using that number. It is like an
address.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seeing things in a macro perspective, same thing happens
with the Internet. It started with a tiny network of
computers to share data among research organizations. As
more and more computers got connected to the network and as
more and more computers got connected to those computers
connected to the network, the Internet began to take shape.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not possible to connect individual computers from all
over the world. So in came the ISPs like AOL to whom you
could connect. In turn they would connect to other ISPs and
information gateways, and so on. So if you're connected to
your local ISP, then your local ISP is connected to some
bigger network and so you are connected to that bigger
network too. And hence, this is how the Internet is a big
network of interconnected computers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After reading all this, you might say, "All the more reason
for me to believe that if I've created the web pages on my
computer, everybody should be able to see them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, to have a website on the Internet you first need to
have a web server that is connected to the Internet 24x7.
Unfortunately, managing a web server can be very costly and
needs technical knowledge that most businesses do not have.
This is where "Web hosts" come in. Web hosts provide the
equipment and other technical resources that are needed to
provide you a customized web site.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Web hosting services are more advantageous because they are
outsourced, meaning that the physical location of the Web
server does not reside at the consumer's premises.
Outsourcing your Web presence effectively transfers the
responsibility for maintaining your Web site infrastructure
from yourself to an organization that is more competent to
do so.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can take advantage of a web host in order to free
yourself from pre-occupying your scarce human and financial
resources on web host issues. Individuals and companies who
outsource their Web presence do so in order to achieve the
following objectives: reduce and control operating costs;
improve their own company focus; gain access to in-depth
expertise; free internal resources for core competencies;
and obtain access to world-class capabilities to control IT
functions which are difficult to manage.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, the next time you think of having a website, keep in
mind that a hosting service is a quintessential part of your
plan of things to come.</P>
