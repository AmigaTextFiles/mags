Hi Sue, <BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just another note from 
your bottom-dwelling brother. Last week I had a bad day at the office. I 
know you've been feeling down lately at work, so I thought I would share my 
dilemma with you to make you realize it's not so bad after all. Before I can 
tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few 
technicalities of my job.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the 
sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wetsuit. This time of year the 
water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel 
powered industrial water heater. This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the 
water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temperature. It then 
pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air 
hose. Now this sounds like a darn good plan, and I've used it several times 
with no complaints. What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, 
is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wetsuit. This floods my 
whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a Jacuzzi.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything was 
going well until all of a sudden, my arse started to itch. So, of course, I 
scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my arse 
started to burn.I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In agony I realized what had happened. The hot water machine had sucked up a 
jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. Now since I don't have any hair on my 
back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it. However, the crack of my arse was 
not as fortunate. When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was 
actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my arse. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I informed the 
dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator his instructions were 
unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all 
laughing hysterically. Needless to say I aborted the dive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was instructed 
to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totalling thirty five 
minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry 
decompression. When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my 
brass helmet.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of 
laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub 
it on my arse as soon as I got in the chamber. The cream put the fire out, 
but I couldn't poo for two days because my arse was swollen shut.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, next 
time you're having a bad day at work, think about how much worse it would be 
if you had a jellyfish shoved up your backside! Now repeat to yourself, "<B>I 
love my job, I love my job, I love my...... </B></P>
