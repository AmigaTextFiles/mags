<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, as they say "Life moves on". It was heart wrenching to be
suddenly "Grounded" from my beloved Train catering role, But
moving into the catering stores was not as daunting as I first
imagined.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill Pollock (Area Manager) spent the best part of Two weeks
instructing me in the "Ins and Outs" of running the Store. In
reality it was not much different for running a Restaurant Car, And
I got the hang of the paper work quite Quickly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course certain aspects of the Job were completely New to me,
Dealing with Salesmen, Phoning Suppliers, Checking and comparing
various Suppliers prices etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One point that certainly did surprise me was, Bill Pollock
circulated the Stores Phone Number to all the relevant "Train
Catering Offices" with instruction to them that all "Train
Catering" Queries or Messages would now be directed to the
Stores!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was at this point that I realised why Mr. Pollock was so keen to
get a person with a background in Train Catering to work in the
Store. Truth be known, Mr. Pollock disliked Train Catering and all
the extra work it had presented to him. Now he passed this
workload squarely onto my Shoulders.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose in truth I was being used as a sort of Under Manager
(Overworked and underpaid) But I enjoyed it, I was working closely
with Train Catering Managers and the Office staff, and gaining
experience in fields that I didn't know existed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Still life in the Stores was not a bed of Roses, While the
Paperwork was simple to get to grips with, The manual side showed
my inexperience.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Living in the North of Scotland, you accept the mysteries of 
    the Weather, Sunny one moment, a horrendous Downpour the next.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was during one to these downpours that Scottish Brewers decided
to arrive with a delivery (40 cases of McEwans Export cans).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No real problem for me, after all they were delivering, so THEY
wheeled them from the lorry to the store (And got soaked in the
process)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With a dry "Smirk" I signed for the delivery and when they had
left the store I proceeded to move the cases from the store into
the cellar (Drink store).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately the Cellar area was restricted for space, So cases
had to be built up as high as possible, In this case 20 cases
high.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not a problem to a your fit Guy, However I had completely
disregarded the fact that soaking wet Cardboard, Encasing 24 heavy
cans to Beer, is not all that strong.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lifting the last case up, the Cardboard gave way, and suddenly 24
cans to McEwans "Rained" down on my head.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bruised Battered and bewildered I fell to the floor, But my
troubles didn't end there. Three of the cans burst!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A pressured can of beer that bursts tend to spin very quickly and
spray the contents out quite a distance, In the confines of the
small cellar area, I was totally soaked stinking like a
brewery, And had a head resembling the "Elephant Man"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This accident required a quick visit to the Station Medical room,
and although not badly hurt, I did require 2 stitches to a cut in
my forehead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Pollock offered me the rest of the day off, But I was a Man, so
I continued my shift.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a rather battered and bandaged Ferret that returned home
that evening, my wife took one look at me, and burst into tears.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"It's not that bad" I said fingering the Stitches on my head.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are you talking about? Said my wife. I'm crying because Hugh
Mortimer has just died in Crossroads. (The Soap of the season).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So much with Loving concern :(</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well after that I did learn my lesson, Wet Cardboard crates 
    were left until they were dry, However accidents can still happen, even bizarre 
    ones!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Catering store was situated just a little behind the Cafeteria
back door, The small area between was used to house 3 large open
topped bins for the Cafeteria waste. One bin was allocated for
waste food stuff, Which was picked up every afternoon and taken
away for Pig Swill (quite alright in the 70's).</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although in warm weather these Bins did smell a little, I 
    very quickly became used to that, What i didn't like was the Squalling Seagulls 
    that regularly fought while trying to get a free meal.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Inverness Seagull population are fearless, I know of 
    a chief Steward that was actually attacked by one while trying to load his 
    stores.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, this particular day I had to leave the stores and deliver
an order to the Sweet Kiosk in the centre of the Station. I
pushed the loaded trolley out of the Store, Locked the door .....</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Next  thing  I remember was waking up in the Medical  centre,
Surrounded  by Bill Pollock,  The Railway Police and  the  Medical
Staff.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seemingly  one of the Catering staff had gone to  put  some  waste
into  the bins and found me lying outside the store in a  pool  of
Blood!</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Concerned in case I had been attacked, Mr. Pollock called the 
    Police.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately the Stores on the Trolley had not been touched, 
    and the Keys were found in my hand ...So What HAD Happened?</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well lying beside my "Prone" Body was a large Chicken Carcass. 
    The Police could only surmise that a Seagull had lifted it out of the Bin 
    and flown off with it. Either it had been attacked by another or just lost 
    its grip, Regardless, the Chicken carcass plummeted to the ground, only to 
    land squarely on top of my head, Knocking me unconscious and requiring another 
    4 stitches in my head (I still have the Scar).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I suppose my lifes claim to fame is, Being the only person
attacked and beaten by a dead and partially eaten Chicken.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Maybe this Stores job is not as easy as I first thought.</P>
