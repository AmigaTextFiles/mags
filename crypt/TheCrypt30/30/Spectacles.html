<CENTER>I tried a new optician's once to have my eyesight done</CENTER>
<CENTER>But how I wished afterwards that his practise I had shun.</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I had the phone call to say my glasses were ready</CENTER>
<CENTER>I struggled up his blooming stairs taking it very steady.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>"There" he exclaimed as he put the glasses on my nose</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Look at your self in the mirror" said he "Go put on a pose"</CENTER>
<CENTER>Is he kidding? I thought as my eyes were struggling to see</CENTER>
<CENTER>Surely all of the faces I saw could not all belong to me? </CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>"Are you sure that these are mine?" I said very warily</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Oh yes of course" he said waving his hands about airily.</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Your eyes will soon get adjusted to the stronger lens"</CENTER>
<CENTER>But all I could see were many pockets holding lots of pens.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Anyway I decided that I would give them a fair try</CENTER>
<CENTER>So I paid my costly bill and bid him a curt goodbye.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Why did there seem more stairs, than when I first went in?</CENTER>
<CENTER>Stepping gingerly on my way down as I fell and made a din.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I hung on firmly to the wall as I groped my way back home</CENTER>
<CENTER>Vowing that in these glasses never more would I dare roam.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It was when I tried to find the keyhole in the front door</CENTER>
<CENTER>I could have sworn I had one and my aim was very poor.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/oldmanwalking.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="149" ALT="oldmanwalking.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>But it's when I started to read my book that I suddenly found</CENTER>
<CENTER>I could see so much better with my glasses turned around.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was by this time very angry and apart from all my bumps</CENTER>
<CENTER>I felt like giving that optician a few ruddy great lumps</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I put on my old specs and back to him, in a rage, I did duly go</CENTER>
<CENTER>I threw my glasses at him and said " I think you ought to know</CENTER>
<CENTER>My lenses have been put in back to front. No wonder I felt bereft</CENTER>
<CENTER>My left eye has been looking right and my right one looking left</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>He very soon apologised when I said I would take him to court</CENTER>
<CENTER>As he said he would reimburse me for all that the money bought.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I settled for my money back and I said enough was enough</CENTER>
<CENTER>He could go and shove the glasses right up his blooming duff.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Would you like to read my tale from many years ago</CENTER>
<CENTER>A funny little story that you might like to know.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I have always worn glasses and one day I did espy</CENTER>
<CENTER>That one of my lens was loose, it was the right eye.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>I was due to meet my hubby as to the flicks we'd go</CENTER>
<CENTER>And in our seats we settled to watch a film show.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Suddenly I sneezed and out shot the lens sky high</CENTER>
<CENTER>I jumped up quickly crying "Oh Gawd! I've lost me eye"</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Everyone around started looking with bums up in the air</CENTER>
<CENTER>The usherette came along saying,"What's going on there?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>There were hisses and boo's and I felt such a proper twit</CENTER>
<CENTER>" Why can't you sit down, and let's see the end of it?"</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>A little lad found a marble, "Is this it?" he shouted</CENTER>
<CENTER>"No!"I said, "It is a glass lens that I have outed."</CENTER>
<CENTER>Unfortunately I had to screw my eyes up very tight</CENTER>
<CENTER>To try and focus on the film to get it in my sight.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>When the interval came my hubby shot off to the loo</CENTER>
<CENTER>When he came back he said " I've got something for you"</CENTER>
<CENTER>There in his hand was my lens, which he handed to me</CENTER>
<CENTER>The lens had lodged into his trouser turn ups you see.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>I came out of that cinema and to the opticians I went</CENTER>
<CENTER>With my pride having suffered such a ruddy great dent.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I look back over life and see the comical times I've had</CENTER>
<CENTER>Although times were tough, they were not all that bad.</CENTER>
