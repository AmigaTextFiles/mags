  <p>Last issue, I showed the LeecHammer software, which is used with WinMX P2P 
    system.</p>
<p>I though I had better now show you the other main piece of software used with 
  WinMX.</p>
<p>This is MX Monitor.</p>
<p>It can be found at <a href="http://www3.to/mxmonitor">http://www3.to/mxmonitor</a></p>
<p>The version I am using currently is ……..</p>

<p>MX monitor is similar to LeecHammer in that it helps manage your queue and 
  allows you to get rid of leeches (that’s the folk who don’t share files, but 
  expect you to provide them with some).</p>
<p>It has found wide acceptance on WinMX, judging by the comments and names shown 
  on this particular P2P.</p>
<p>The software is downloaded as a simple zip file. It is only 165k in size, so 
  takes practically no time at all to download.</p>
<p>Extracting the zip gives you a ready-made folder called Mxmoni128eb here. The 
  “E” is for the English version.</p>
<p>Simply double click the executable file and we’re off. </p>
<p>MX monitor will ask where WinMX is to be found. Tell it where, and the system 
  will start up.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=287 height=131
src="Images/mxmonitor004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
  <p>We can now play a little with the preferences. It is very similar to LeecHammer 
    in what it does; so don’t be surprised that a lot if the prefs look slightly 
    familiar.</p>
  <p> <img border=0 width=884 height=559
src="Images/mxmonitor006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>This is how Mx Monitor normally looks, before it gets busy and shows you all 
  the users in your queue and the people it is checking for your own list of files.</p>
<p>Right, the prefs!</p>
<p>Click the settings tab, and we get this……….</p>
  <p> <img border=0 width=955 height=605
src="Images/mxmonitor008.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>This means you can limit your upload queue. Moving on to the juicy bits………….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=967 height=612
src="Images/mxmonitor010.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>Again, this is similar to LeecHammer, albeit in slightly different terms. Here 
  we specify who to immediately ignore, and wipe from our queue.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=967 height=612
src="Images/mxmonitor012.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>Very similar to LeecHammer again, although it doesn’t mention the “zero file” 
  hack, but does include zero upload as a means of getting rid of someone from 
  the queue.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=967 height=612
src="Images/mxmonitor014.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>This is a lot easier than LeecHammer to set up for friends or people whom you 
  have downloaded from before. Simply add their user name to get them started 
  straightaway.</p>
<p>It also allows you to specify that if someone in your queue starts you, it 
  will be reciprocated!</p>
<p>You can also add small text files ( lists?) as something that will be automatically 
  uploaded whenever.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=847 height=536
src="Images/mxmonitor016.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>Pick your favourite sound scheme, and use that.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=835 height=529
src="Images/mxmonitor018.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>A variety of logs can be saved as well.</p>
<p>As you can see, since this program is similar to LeecHammer, it will boil down 
  to your own preference.</p>
<p>LeecHammer works well, and I’ve tried this for a few weeks as well. It also 
  works well, and has the added benefit of allowing friends etc more or less instant 
  access to your files. This, I feel, gives it a slight edge over LeecHammer at 
  present, but this could rapidly change as both these programs get updated. </p>
<p>I’ve decided to keep both on my drive just now, and some people run both at 
  the same time!</p>
<p>If you run WinMX, this program can make your life much easier ……….and help 
  keep leeches at bay.</p>
  <p>Another file to download for those that use WinMX.</p>
  <p>Nearly forgot to mention……it’s free, of course!</p>
