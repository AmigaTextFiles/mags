<p><b><i><span>  <font size="+1">  </font></span><font size="+1">Ok, so you`ve 
  just bought a new sound card, or thinking about buying one, which speakers do 
  you go for to give you the best sounds with quality as well?  And also will 
  they give their best best results with your new sound card or the one you’re 
  thinking of buying?</font></i></b></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>Right, I was in the same predicament 
  some months ago, when I first bought my latest PC (just the base unit, no monitor, 
  no k.board, &amp; no printer etc) from my neighbors son the system only had 
  a basic PCI 4 or 8mb sound card fitted to it, but I didn`t think the sound was 
  so important at the time to warrant putting that at the top of my “Priority 
  To Buy List”, so I upgraded the motherboard, Processor, Memory, Hard Drive, 
  GFX card, etc, virtually everything else to make my PC not only perform better 
  that it was, but to also look good after it`s booted up.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>But obviously I had to get a better 
  sound card if I wanted to listen to quality music, ah, but which card, eventually, 
  after looking at all my possibilities I opted for the Creative Sound blaster 
  Audigy Live 5.1 card, which at first seemed good.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>But like most of us, I didn`t want “Good”, 
  I wanted “Fantastic”, and after installing the basic sound card drivers I noticed 
  a program on their called MusicMatch Jukebox, now, at the time I only had the 
  normal PC multimedia stereo speaker system, which was so-so, but of course I 
  wanted better.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>I asked a contact of mine (Pete Selmes) 
  what sound card &amp; speaker system he`d got, he told me it was a 5.1 Videologic 
  system which had a big base mains-powered sub-woofer, and 5 small speakers which 
  combined with the soundblaster live card was quite definitely the dogs testicles.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>But the speaker system was nigh-on £60 
  I think, well, I had no Painting &amp; Decorating jobs on at the time, so I 
  was as per norm “SKINT”, so I had to wait, time went on, and the piece of paper 
  that I had written the name of this speaker system down on had of course got 
  lost with all the other scraps of paper that mysteriously disappear into the 
  great waster paper bin in the the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>Just before Christmas of 2002, I heard 
  through the grapevine (sorry, no pun intended), that an aunt of mine from Leamington 
  Spa had died, she was my dads sister, dad hated her because she thought that 
  she was better than him or anyone else in or out of the family, in fact, she 
  reminds me of “Mrs Bucket – Mrs bouquet” from “Keeping Up Appearances, and my 
  Uncle Charles was the poor henpecked husband Richard.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>Anyway, I digress, I couldn`t stand 
  the old cow anyway, my family from way-back have/are Romany Gypsy`s, and have 
  been &amp; are still very proud of our heritage, but my aunt was ashamed of 
  being born into such a heritage that she disowned it, continually saying that 
  it was either nonsense, or that she was adopted.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>Anyway, the long &amp; short of it all 
  I found out almost immediately after xmas that out of her fortune of just over 
  13.7 million pounds (which had bin left her by two recluse rich brothers who 
  she had been a housekeeper for, for many years, I was to recieve more money 
  than I had ever seen or held in my hand at any one time, so although I would 
  have loved loads more, that amount was better than a smack in the gob with a 
  wet fish as they say.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>  </span>So, wot was I to spend my cash on, well, 
  pay a few bills off firstly, then send my rented TV/Video, &amp; buy a nice 
  brand new Silver Panasonic 28” fst surround sound Dolby pro-logic system with 
  vcr &amp; DVD, get rid on my old dilapidated Sony hi-fi system in favor of another 
  Sony hi-fi, but one with a turntable or a separate turntable, eventually I got 
  my new TV system as I wanted it, and my new hi-fi, I had to settle for a nice 
  matching Silver Kenwood turntable, a nice piece of kit I must say, sounds brill.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>I decided to add another 256 of RAM 
  to my PC, giving me 512 in all, a new towercase with 400w PSU &amp; extra USB 
  ports on the fronts soon followed, a new 80Gb Seagate 7200rpm hard drive, a 
  new Logitech iTouch internet keyboard followed as well, plus other odds &amp; 
  ends, but, the part I`m working round to was the fact on popping down to our 
  local PC trade counter in Rugby which is called Stak Trading, I heard the best 
  sounds coming from a PC system with the niftiest speakers I had seen/heard ever, 
  especially for their size.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>The speaker system I`m on about are 
  the VideoLogic ZXR-500 5.1 surround sound, the sub-woofer is a big box, but 
  quite stylish, with 4 controls on it, then the 5 smaller speakers are front 
  left &amp; right, centre &amp; rear left &amp; right, now although the speakers 
  are quit small, the sound they produce in conjunction with the soundcard is 
  phenomenal, both powerful &amp; crystal clear, so, if your considering getting 
  a new soundcard &amp; speakers, why not consider this setup…</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i><span>    </span>If you love your music &amp; of top 
  quality , then complement your sound with a top-notch soundcard &amp; speakers 
  system….(Dr Jekyll)..</i></b></font></p>
