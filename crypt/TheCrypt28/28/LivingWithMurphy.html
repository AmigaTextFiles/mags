<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  used to race the old Triumph around an old disused gravel  pit
on  Saturday  afternoons.   If Dad  had  thought  it  would  be  a
dangerous bike for me to manage,  I'm glad he never saw us  racing
in  that  gravel pit - without helmets and missing  trees  by  the
skin  of our teeth we learnt more about handling bikes than  could
have ever been taught by any driving school.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  had another old bike there - a New Imperial I think it  was  -
and  when the engines got too hot and seized up we would let  them
cool  down  until  we  could spit on the motor  without  the  spit
flying straight off with a '<B>splat</B>' and then it would be on  again.
George  and  John,  owners of the old bikes,  went  on  to  become
serious  grass-track racers using special <B>JAP</B> racing bikes  but  I
never  had  the  finance for that.  Murphy must  have  been  going
through a '<B>be-kind-to-Lionel</B>' phase because we never came  to  any
harm despite the horrendous risks we used to take.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I've  always hated the cold and working in the core-making section
of  the  foundry  was great in winter because we had  our  benches
next to a huge gas oven where the cores - the sand mouldings  that
were used to form the inside of castings - were baked.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One  of  our  work mates was a young fellow with a propensity  for
itching.  He was susceptible to any suggestion of an itch  whether
verbal  or  mimed.  Cruel beasts that we were  -  most  days  when
things  got a bit boring someone would start a conversation  about
sand-fleas or similar biting creatures or else one or more  of  us
would  start scratching some imaginary itch.  Within  minutes  our
friend  was furiously scratching too and calling us all the  names
under the sun.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As  soon as I reached my seventeenth birthday I wanted a  car  and
having  very  little money settled on a 1929 fabric-bodied  Morris
Minor  that was on show outside a local wreckers yard.  It  should
have  stayed  there because this was the chance  Murphy  had  been
waiting for to show his stuff.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It arrived on a truck - an omen in itself.  That evening Dad and I
went  for our first drive and were getting along very nicely  when
something  overtook  us  as  I slowed for  an  intersection.   The
something  turned out to be one of our back wheels which  trundled
on  for  some time before bouncing to a stop in a ditch.  The  car
continued  for a little while on an even keel but subsided  on  to
the  back corner amid a shower of sparks as we lost speed!.   This
was  the first of many adventures with that car with Murph  honing
his skills during every outing we took with it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One  memorable Sunday we were heading for Mum's sister's  home  at
Aldermaston,  a journey of about a hundred miles each way  and  by
far  the longest trip we had undertaken.  Just past Salisbury  the
engine  petered out and a look under the bonnet showed a bolt  had
come  out  of  the S.U.  carburettor and let all the  petrol  out.
Fortunately a roadside search recovered the offending bolt and  we
were  able to proceed to our next stop which was made to change  a
punctured tyre.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our  visiting  time  with Aunt Flo was taken  up  with  finding  a
garage  open  on Sunday afternoon and willing to mend  a  puncture
and  we  started out for home with our confidence a little shaken.
Rightly so as we had forgotten we had lost a lot of fuel when  the
bolt  came  adrift and so ran out of petrol just after  dark  near
Basingstoke.  Dad had to walk for miles to find a  petrol  station
open  to fill a can with petrol.  Not a lot was said for the  rest
of the journey home until we had another puncture at Salisbury.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  were lucky really I suppose because I went out in the car next
day  and had yet another puncture but this time had no spare wheel
as I hadn't got around to having it fixed.  With ingenuity born of
desperation,   I  resorted to filling  the  tyre  with  grass  and
limping the few miles back home.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That  car  had  dreadful  play  in the  steering  joints,   severe
vibration  from the worn canvas universal couplings  and  terrible
tappet  clatter that I thought was impossible to cure  until  many
years later when I discovered the engine was a forerunner of  many
Wolseleys  and  MGs with similar eccentric bush  tappet  clearance
adjustment.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I  replaced the universals one day when the vibration  had  become
too  bad  to  live  with  any longer and  went  out  on  the  main
Bournemouth road to test it out.  On a straight stretch I got  the
needle hovering around sixty miles an hour!  I think it was 60 mph
but  I couldn't watch the speedometer very closely because  I  was
too  busy  keeping the car going in a roughly straight  line  with
the  steering wheel having about a foot of free play  and  needing
very gentle corrections from one side to the other.</P>
