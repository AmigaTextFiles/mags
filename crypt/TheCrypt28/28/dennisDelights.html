<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two  weeks ago was my 44th birthday and I wasn't feeling  too  hot
that  morning.  I went down to breakfast knowing my wife would  be
pleasant and say "<B>Happy Birthday</B>" and probably have a present  for
me.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  didn't  even  say  "<B>Good  Morning</B>",   let  alone  any  "<B>Happy
Birthday.</B>" I thought,  "Well,  that's wives for you.  The children
will  remember.  " The children came down to breakfast and  didn't
say a word.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  I  started  to  the  office I was  feeling  pretty  low  and
despondent.  As I walked into my office, my secretary, Janet said,
"<B>Good  Morning,  Boss,  Happy Birthday.</B>" I felt a  little  better....
Someone had remembered.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I worked until noon,  then Janet knocked on my door and said, "You
know  it  is such a beautiful day outside and it is your birthday,
let's go to lunch,  just you and me." I said,  "By George,  that's
the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We went to lunch.  We didn't go where we normally go.  We went out
into  the  country to a little private place.  We had two martinis
and  enjoyed lunch tremendously.  On the way back to  the  office,
she said,  "You know,  it's such a beautiful day, we don't need to
go  back to the office,  do we?" I said,  "No,  I guess not."  She
said, "Let's go to my apartment."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  arriving at her apartment she said,  "Boss,  if  you  don't
mind,   I  think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into  something
more comfortable." "Sure," I excitedly replied.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She went into the bedroom and,  in about six minutes she came  out
carrying a big birthday cake,  followed by my wife,  children  and
dozens of our friends.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  were all singing <B>Happy Birthday</B>.......  and there I  sat  on
the couch.......<B>naked</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  went  to the store the other day,  and I was in there for  only
about  5  minutes.   When I came out there was  a  motorcycle  cop
writing a parking ticket.</P>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/cop2.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="156" HEIGHT="156" ALT="cop2.gif"></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">So I went up to him and said,  "Come on, buddy, how about giving a
guy a break?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He ignored me and continued writing the ticket.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So I called him a <B>pencil-necked Nazi</B>.  He glared at me and started
writing another ticket for worn tires!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So I called him a piece of <B>horse s**t</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He  finished  the second ticket and put it on the windshield  with
the first. Then he started writing a third ticket!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This went on for about 20 minutes...  the more I abused him,   the
more tickets he wrote. <B>I didn't care</B>. My car was parked around the
corner. I try to have a little fun each day. It's important.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  man walks into a restaurant with an ostrich behind him,  and as
he sits, the waitress comes over and asks for their order.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  man  says,  "I'll have a hamburger,  fries and a  coke,"  and
turns to the ostrich. "What's yours?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>I'll have the same,</B>" says the ostrich.</P>
<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  short  time  later the waitress returns with the order.   "That
will  be  $6.40 please," and the man reaches into his  pocket  and
pulls out exact change for payment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says,
"I'll have a hamburger,  fries and a coke," and the ostrich  says,
"<B>I'll have the same.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  again  the man reaches into his pocket and pays  with  exact
change.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  becomes  a routine until late one evening,   the  two  enter
again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The usual?" asks the waitress.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"No,  this is Friday night,  so I will have a steak,  baked potato
and salad," says the man.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Same  for me,</B>" says the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress
comes with the order and says, "That will be $32.62."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  again  the  man pulls exact change out  of  his  pocket  and
places it on the table.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. "Excuse me,
sir.   How  do you manage to always come up with the exact  change
out of your pocket every time?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Well," says the man,  "several years ago I was cleaning the attic
and  I  found an old lamp.  When I rubbed it a Genie appeared  and
offered  me two wishes.  My first wish was that if I ever  had  to
pay for anything,  I could just put my hand in my pocket,  and the
right amount of money would always be there."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"That's  brilliant!" says the waitress.  "Most people  would  wish
for  a million dollars or something,  but you'll always be as rich
as you want for as long as you live!"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the
exact money is always there," says the man.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  waitress  asks,   "One other thing,  sir,   what's  with  the
ostrich?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  man  replies,   "My second wish was for  a  chick  with  long
legs..."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  woman  was out golfing one day when she hit her ball  into  the
woods.  She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in
a trap.  The frog said to her,  "<B>If you release me from this trap,
I  will  grant you 3 wishes.</B>" The woman freed the frog.  The  frog
said,   "<B>Thank  you,  but I failed to mention  that  there  was  a
condition  to  your wishes,  whatever you wish for,  your  husband
will get 10 times more or better!</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  woman  said,  "That would be okay." For her first wish,   she
wanted  to  be  the most beautiful woman in the world.   The  frog
warned  her,  "<B>You do realize that this wish will also  make  your
husband the most handsome man in the world,  an Adonis, that women
will  flock to.</B>" The woman replied,  "That will be okay because  I
will  be  the most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes  for
me." So,  <B>KAZAM</B> - she's the most beautiful woman in the world! For
her second wish,  she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.
The  frog said,  "<B>That will make your husband the richest  man  in
the  world  and he will be ten times richer than you.</B>"  The  woman
said,   "That will be okay because what's mine is his  and  what's
his is mine." So, <B>KAZAM</B> she's the richest woman in the world!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  frog  then inquired about her third wish,  and she  answered,
"I'd like a mild heart attack."</P>
