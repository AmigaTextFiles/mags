<I>The Shepherd of Blow</I><BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  the village of Blow,  there was once a shepherd,  who died for
unknown  reasons.   Several days after his  burial,   he  took  to
reappearing  in  his  village  and tormenting  the  people  there.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone on whom he visited would die within 8 days.  His case would
be unremarkable,  but for what happened next. Tired of his nightly
ravishes,   the  villagers took the body from the grave--  finding
it,   of  course,  to be in a vampire state-- and they  staked  it
through the heart and put it back in the grave.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That  night,  the shepherd was again seen,  and even  angrier  and
more  vicious than before.  He now carried the stake in his  hand,
and  he  taunted  that  the stake made a  good  weapon  to  defend
himself against the village dogs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  frightened  people disinterred the  body  again  and  had  it
burned, finally ending the shepherd's deadly spree.</P>

<I>Arnod Paole</I> (Arnold Paul)<BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1727  a  young soldier,  by the name of Arnod Paole,  returned
home to a village near Belgrade,  after completing his service. He
had enough money to but some land and a house,  and though he  was
a  wonderful neighbor,  his social skills were a little less  than
desireable,   as  he always had an air of sorrow  about  him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  finally  fell in love with a neighbor girl and  they  married,
though  his melencholia still persisted.  His wife finally managed
to get the reason for his saddness out of him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arnod  admitted to her that while on duty one  night,   in  a  far
town,   he  was attacked by a creature who bit him  and  tried  to
drain  his  blood.  He managed to fight the thing off until  dawn,
when the body fell lifeless and he was able to stake and burn  the
body to ashes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before doing so,  he drank a small amount of the vampire's  blood,
but  being unfamiliar with the local territory,  he was unable  to
find the vampire's grave to extract and consume the dirt from it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arnod  told  his  wife  that he was fearful,   since  he  had  not
competed  the  ritual,  that he would become a  vampire  upon  his
death.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not  long  after his confession,  a loaded wagon of  hay  fell  on
Arnod  one  day  in the field and crushed him to death.   About  a
month  after  his  burial,    townspeople  reported  seeing  Arnod
wandering  around the village,  and those whom he came  in  direct
contact with died within a few days.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  ceaseless nightly attacks,  the villagers decided to  raise
Arnod's  body.   His  case  was made  unique  in  that  government
officials  were  called out to inspect the body  and  an  official
report was made of it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In attendance at the public exhumation were two military surgeons.
When the sexton finally raised the coffin and pried open the  lid,
they found Arnod's body,  in the ground some 40 days, fresh and in
a vampiric state.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sexton exclaimed over the fresh blood at his mouth,  "Ah,  you
didn't  wipe  your  mouth  after   last  night's  work."  A  young
attendant of the surgeons fainted at the sight.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arnod's body,  however,  was staked and burned to ash,  the  ashes
being  replaced  in  the  grave.  Several  others  who  were  have
believed  to have died from Arnod's attack were also  exhumed  and
similarly reduced to ash.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,  the nightly attacks resumed some five years later,   and
another official investigation was conducted and many more  graves
were  open,  some being in a vampire state and others being  in  a
normal state of decomposition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Burning the suspected vampires,  and returning the others to their
graves,  the vamprie plague finally ceased once and for all.   The
report  given  by  witnesses--  military  surgeons,   ang  various
officals--  was sent to the highest authorities and still  remains
intact to this day.</P>

<I>Peter Plogojowitz</I><BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten  years after the death of one Peter Plogojowitz,  his  village
in  Hungary reported seeing Peter wandering the streets by  night.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  some instances,  he came into people's houses and choked them,
causing  them  to  die  in  less than 24 hours.   Even  the  widow
Plogojowitz  reported that her deceased husband  had  appeared  to
her,  demanding his shoes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  villagers  asked the local military officials for  permission
to disinter the body. Though reluctant, they ageed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  officer and a minister were present at the exhumation,   upon
which they found Peter's body intact,  despite his being dead  for
a  decade.   His body was staked-- a great amount of  fresh  blood
flowing  from it-- and burnt to ash,  wherein the  deaths  in  the
village ceased.</P>

<I>Aswid and Asmund</I><BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There  were once two great Icelandic warriors,  Aswid and  Asmund.
They  were not only the greatest of generals,  but they were  also
blood brothers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of them suggested,  as they grew older,  that they should make
a  death pact-- that when one of them died,  the other would go to
the grave with his friend.  They both agreed to this and swore  on
their blood.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  came to pass that Aswid grew ill and died.  All of the  people
mourned,   and there was many days of funeral rites and  feasting,
to commemerate the fallen hero.  True to his oath, Asmund followed
his  friend  to  the grave,  despite the protests of  other  close
friends  and advisors.  Asmund was sealed alive in the  tomb  with
the  body  of his friend and many other tributes to entertain  the
dead in the afterlife,  such as food, horses, Aswid's favorite dog
and weapons.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before  Asmund had decided how best to kill himself,  Aswid  awoke
from his death sleep.  Rising as a vampire,  he first consumed the
body of his dog,  then of the horses. He then turned his attention
on his friend,  and attacked him with a demonic fury.  Taking up a
sword, Aswid fought off his former friend.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some three hundred years later,  several daring young men set  off
to  the tomb of the famous warriors.  Despite warnings of the tomb
being  haunted,  and of the religious implications  of  disturbing
the  dead,  the brave young men went to the grave and  opened  it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hearing  sounds of struggle,  one man volunteered to go down  into
the  tomb.   Lowering him on a rope,  he went down to investigate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The friends called to him after several minutes,  then were met by
a great tug on the rope. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  pulled  the rope up,  only to find an old-fashioned  armored
warrior at the end of it.  Trying to catch his breath, Asmund told
them of the story of Aswid rising as a vampire and trying to  kill
him.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  had  been fighting for his life for three hundred years,   and
had  succeded  only when the young man had appeared,   offering  a
distraction.   With  that,  he fell over  dead.   The  young  men,
realizing the bravery of the warrior Asmund,  buried  him  in  the
tomb with full honor,  their companion beside him.  They took  the
decapitated body of Aswid out and burned it,  scattering his ashes
to the wind.</P>

<I>Vlad Tepes, Dracula, Vlad the Impaler</I><BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vlad  Dracula  was born in Wallachia,  admist a tumultuous,   dark
period for Eastern Europe.  The smaller countries warred interally
between a ruling family line and the line of the aristocrats  that
very much determined what the kings would do,  and who would be on
the throne.  Outside the countries they warred amongst each other,
always forming tenative treaties and marraige alliances,  only  to
be  broken  for  better ones with former enemies.  Above  all  the
Church  ruled,  and each king was held accountable to the religion
and  to the Byzantine Emperor.  Add to this the threat of invasion
from the Ottoman Turks, and you have a really nasty time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vlad  Dracula  was  born the second son  of  Vlad  Dracul  and  an
unknown woman.  Because of a lack of documentation (either through
it  being  lost,   or  just never being recorded),   the  date  of
Dracula's  birth  is  unknown,  but by  looking  at  the  earliest
records  written by Drakul,  mentioning his second son,   scholars
have  dated  Vlad  Dracula's birth to be between  1429  and  1437.
Mircea,  the eldest, and Vlad were probably full brothers, born of
the  same woman.  The third son of Dracul,  Radu,  was born  of  a
different  woman.  Two other brother,  Vlad the Monk  and  Mircea,
were  born of yet another woman,  or possibly two different women,
most  likely  Dracul's mistresses.  Only the eldest Mircea,   Vlad
Dracula  and Radu were officially recognized by their  father  and
considered  as legitimate heirs to the throne their father  worked
so hard to obtain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vlad  Dracul's  policy  for his country seemed  to  be  preserving
peace  and independence.  Though from a Christian sect that  swore
to  uphold  Christian allies over any pagans,  Vlad  Dracul  tried
very hard to keep the peace with his southern neighbors,  the much
stronger Turks.  Vlad was very reluctant and hesitant to give  aid
to any of his Christian neighbors.  In one instance, when he could
no  longer  afford  to overlook his Christian  brethren,   he  was
forced to break treaty with the Turks.  Afterward he was obligated
to  send  his  children (either through his own  idea  of  keeping
peace,  or the Turks'),  Dracula,  12 or 13, and Radu, about 9, to
the  Turks  as  hostages.  Dracul would not dare  break  any  more
treaties  with the Turks for fear of them retaliating against  the
children.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dracula  spent  nearly four years in Turkish captivity,   although
most  of  it  was probably not spent in a jail cell.  While  there
Dracula learned the Turkish language,  finished his education  and
learned Turkish methods for welfare.  Later on,  when Vlad  Dracul
broke  another  treaty  with the Turks,   the  boys'  stay  became
harsher.  Radu,  weaker in nature,  most likely ended  up  in  the
Sultan's harem,  and later became a favorite of the Sultan.   Vlad
was kept solely as a prisoner,  as he was more rebellious.  It  is
here that most scholars think Dracula learned his brutal ways.  He
certainly got his inclination towards impaling from the Turks,  as
well  as,  most likely,  a deep abiding hatred for his father  who
sent him there,  and his brother Mircea,  who was allowed to  stay
at their father's side, out of harm's way.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  1447  Dracul's enemies among the Christians finally caught  up
with  him.   Hunyady of Hungary attacked Vlad Dracul's  castle  in
Tirgoviste.   Mircea was captured by enemy boyars (noblemen)   who
buried him alive.  Vlad Dracul was chased down to marshes near the
town  and  was slain.  He was buried,  apparently,  in an unmarked
grave, which has never been found.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vladislav  II  was  put in charage of Transylvania  following  the
death of Vlad Drakul.  Meanwhile,  Dracula had been placed in  the
Turkish  amy,  and was rapidly gaining experience as a  commander.
During an upset of power in October 1448,  Dracula,  with the help
of  his  Turkish forces,  marched into Transylvania and took  over
his father's throne.  This is his first reigning period. Little is
known about this time,  as it lasted less than two months,  but it
is  very likely that Dracula took revenge on any of the boyars  he
could  find who had been instrumental in his father and  brother's
death.   By Decemeber Vladislav was able to regroup and he  pushed
back into Transylvania, forcing Dracula back to his Turk allies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Defeated,  Dracula eventually made his way to Moldavia,  where  he
stayed and fought alongside his cousin,  Stephen the Great.   When
Stephen's father,  the king, was assinated, the two young men went
to  Wallachia,  and threw themselves on the mercy of Hunyady,  who
had  taken over the Wallachian province after Vladislav's  defeat.
After  a  second exile to Moldavia,  then a return  to  Wallachia,
Dracula  was given some command of the Hungarian-Wallachian  army.
Not  long  after,   the Eastern Roman Empire fell  to  the  Turks,
Hunyady  died from the plague,  and Dracula took his loyal  boyars
and  Wallachians and killed Vladislav,  removing all obstacles  to
his throne.  On September 6,  1456 Dracula took an oath of loyalty
to  the Hungarian king,  followed by a tribute to a Turkish envoy.
Dracula's second reign had begun.</P>
