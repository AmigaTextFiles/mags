<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well I certainly enjoyed my time as Chief Steward on the Inverness
to  Aberdeen  Line,  However like all that  had  gone  before  me,
Eventually the dust and grime from the horrendous Diesel Multiple
Units got the better of me ...  And I applied for, and was accepted for
the Position of Chief Steward Relief.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  a Relief Chief Steward,  I stepped in to cover for the regular
guys when they either had a day off or went on holiday etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This of course meant I had to work various routes and services,  in
the  Inverness  Rail  Catering network ...Including  Buffet  cars,
Griddle Cars and full restaurant cars.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  introduction into the Role of Chief Steward was to take  place
on the "Griddle car" Running between Inverness and Edinburgh.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=silver>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Inverness catering Depot had Two Griddle cars  (Possibly  the
last to run on BR Lines) One to Edinburgh and one to Glasgow.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Griddle car was an in between version of a Restaurant  car  and
Buffet  car.   In that it did serve full Griddle  meals  (All  day
Grill- Fish and Chips - Steak and Chips etc.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Vehicle was divided into four distinct areas.</P>
<FONT COLOR=LIME>
The  seating area for diners (22 seats).<BR>
The buffet counter.<BR>
The kitchen area with  hot plates,  deep fryers and grill.<BR>
The self contained Bar area  complete  with Quarter circle bar,
small tables  and  first class Seating.<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well  of course it wasn't my First time on a Griddle car,  But  it
was  my  first time in charge of one, and of course the  other two
crew members.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this occasion ... Well I thought I was fortunate,  As I had with
me to two regular Stewards that normally worked this route</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><B>Old  Jeanie</B> :- Stewardess of unknown age,  but perhaps around late
fifties.

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">Old  Spud :- Never did get to know his correct name,  Spud  looked
around seventy but I dare say he was in his sixties.</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  my  arrival at the Train ...Both Spud and Jean  seemed  to  be
busy, Cleaning shelves and general tiding up.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> "We have not had time
to get the Stores" <FONT COLOR=AQUA>said Jean ...Looking hopefully at ME.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian trekked down to the store and pushed the heavy loaded trolley up
to the Train.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  timing  was terrible ...I arrived at the Griddle car  Just  as
Spud and Jean decided to go and change into their uniforms, So had
to  man handle  all the stores on board ...Phew ..at  this  rate  I
would be knackered before we got out of the Station.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On departure Spud and Jean seemed to know exactly what to do (Made
my job easier ...I thought).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jean  slotted  inbehind  the Small bar and  started  serving  some
regular customers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spud on the otherhand was behind the Buffet counter serving a  few
travellers and keeping his eyes open for anyone wanting a  meal  at
the Tables.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I of course (the only job left)  started pre-cooking various items
ready for the first meals to be served.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some twenty minute from Inverness we suddenly had a Few people  in
looking for Meals (mostly breakfast).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, cooking on a moving train is not as hard as it looks, Stewards
soon get used to moving their body with the swing of the carriage,
However there is one small point.</P>

<FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER><B>FRIED EGGS</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The eggs were fried on the Hotplate. Sounds simple ...put a little
cooking oil on the hotplate ..Crack an egg ..and it will fry.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However  if  you try cracking the egg when the train  corners  ...
Well, you end up with a little yellow yolk with a two foot streamer
of eggwhite trailing behind it.. (a bit like a shooting star)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having already wasted 3 eggs,  I realised that Spud was have a quiet
giggle  at my misfortune. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "Never mind"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> he said .. <FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"We can have  them
for our breakfast"</font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the Initial rush of Customers had been served thing quietened
down a little. Spud was in the Buffet ...Coughing and Sneezing.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Christ!  I cannot shift this Cold ..IAN ...I'll need a wee drop of
medicine."</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  I was under the Impression that he was talking about a sip  of
Nightnurse or something ...So said "OK"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spud  toddled  off  the  BAR grabbed  a  Minature  Whisky  and
proceeded to make himself a Hot Toddy (Whisky hot water and sugar)....
Now perhaps Toddy isn't all it is cracked up to be ... Spud was on
his fourth That I knew of and he still didn't sound any better.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was fairly quiet so I headed to the Bar,  The main idea was  to
tell Jean not to give Spud any more whisky.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  I  opened  the sliding door,  Jean was standing  behind  the
Counter with a large whisky and water in her hand.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=SILVER>"OH  ...Its  OK Ian"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...Said Jeanie ...<FONT COLOR=SILVER>"This man bought  me  a 
Drink"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> (pointing over to around 6 guys sitting in the Bar)</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By  the  time we were reaching Edinburgh ...The FERRET was  not  a
happy bunny ...Spud was swallowing his Toddy in one go, and by the
Sound of Jeans voice she was well oiled as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RIGHT ..I though ...Some serious talking when we reach Edinburgh.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having  closed up the Catering Vehicle and arrived  at  Edinburgh
both  Jean  and  Spud appeared back in the Griddle  wearing  their
Coats.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">SPUD :- "I'm just off to the Bookies ...Can I put a bet on for  you
Ian?"</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">Jeanie :- "I'm away up to the Shops,  I saw this nice suit for  the
Grandson ...Can I get you anything ..IAN."</P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having  assured  them I neither wanted a bet  on  the  Horses  nor
childrens  clothes they left ...  I was left  to  get  the  Bloody
Stores again ...And clean up.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  couple  of minutes before our departure, to return to  Inverness
Spud  And Jean appeared ....SPUD must have found the only  Bookies
in Britain that sold booze,  And Jeanie certainly hadn't spent all
her time in the Clothes shop.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However like True professionals,  they swung into their  roles  as
soon as the train left the Station.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jeanie  was having a great time with the Bar customers,  and  Spud
was  laughing  and  joking with people at the Food  counter  ..The
Toddies  continued  ...But  at   least  he  stopped  coughing  over
everything.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">30  minutes  prior  to arrival in Inverness the catering  vehicle
closed and I started to tally up the Paperwork and Takings.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Steward  and Chief Stewards rely on tips from satisfied customers
to raise their wages to a reasonable level. I knew we had taken in
around  £20  Tips at the Dining area ...  add this to the  various
other bits and pieces and it should have been a good day.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NO  CHANCE  ...When I tallied up the cash there was only  £2  left
over.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  could see the hostility in Spud and Jeans faces,  as  we  re-
counted  the stock,  Hopefully we would find a mistake  ...But  no
they were spot on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  our arrival back at Inverness,  Spud and Jean shot off to  the
Station bar (for a quick drink after work ...<B>HUH?</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was mulling around the Cafeteria (fuming Mad)  when I got a call
from Mr. Pollock (The Station catering Manager)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In  Mr.  Pollocks office he asked me what was Wrong ..  I told  him
about the Money being short ..</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>To  be honest ..I'm not concerned about the Tips</I>" ..  he said, " <I>How
did you get on with the CREW.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not wanting to drop Spud or Jean in it ..I just replied "OK."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>Remember  Son</I>"  ..Said Mr. Pollock ..  "<I>YOU wear the  Chief  Stewards
Jacket  ...  You decide how the Catering runs ..And I'll back  you
should you need it.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Following Morning,  I arrived at the Train early (Before Spud
of Jean had arrived in the Station.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When  they eventually arrived,  "Right you two ...Down and get  the
Stores!"</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">"Eh ..We need to set up the Shelves"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ...They replied.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Done it!</B> ...Go get the stores."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten  minutes later they returned,  I made myself busy sorting  out
the Dining tables while they humped all the good on board.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By this time Spud was Wheezing and clutching his chest.</P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>Cough!.. Cough</B> ..Dammed cold it right into my lungs!"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ..he said.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"If your not fit for the Job.. SPUD ...Go see Mr. Pollock and tell him
to send up the Spare man to take your Place."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A look of Horror came over his face ...<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"NO.. I'll be alright
...Ian"</font></P><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"You better be .. Cause you'll get no friggin medicine on this
Trip"..I said.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jean by this time had changed into her uniform and was heading for
the BAR.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"HOI JEAN" ... She stopped in her tracks ..."Where are you going?"</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"To the BAR"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ..she said.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"NOPE ..Your on the Cooking today ...I'm doing the BAR."</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"But I always do the Bar ...I'm the Bar Stewardess"<FONT COLOR=AQUA> ..she stammered.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NO  ..Your a Stewardess and you'll either do what your told  ...OR
..You'll get the Hell off my catering vehicle ..Please yourself."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well no need to Bore you with the Details on this Journey, Suffice
to  say it became pretty lonely for me (nobody talking to me)  But
Spud and Jean worked their little socks off.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Come  the end of the Trip ...I tallied up the Cash ..."Mm Tips  are
good ..Over £30 left" I said.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"However as you two got pissed as Newts yesterday ...and  drank  my
share ...You can have a fiver each ..I'll have the rest."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  worked  many  time with this and other Crews in  my  career  as
Relief  Chief Steward,  But because of this occasion,   It  became
common  Knowledge  that  I was a hard but  fair  taskmaster,   And
although  some  tried to pull the Wool over my  eyes,   it  seldom
worked.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  Young ferret had learnt a very important lesson in life,   When
YOU are in charge of Others ...You can't always be popular.</P>
