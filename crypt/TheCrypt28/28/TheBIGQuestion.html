<P ALIGN="LEFT">A young boy went up to his father and asked him, 
"<B>Dad, what is the difference between potentially and realistically?</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The father thought for a moment, then answered, "Go ask your mother if she 
would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then ask your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million 
dollars, and then ask your brother if he'd sleep with Keanu Reeves for a 
million dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the boy went to his mother and asked, "<B>Would you sleep with Robert 
Redford for a million dollars?</B>" The mother replied, "Of course I would. I 
wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that." </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The boy then went to his sister and asked, "<B>Would you sleep with Brad Pitt 
for a million dollars?</B>" The girl replied, "Would I? I would just love to do 
that! I would be nuts to pass up that opportunity!" </P>

know how much a million could buy?" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The boy pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad. His father 
asked him, "Did you find out the difference between potentially and 
realistically?" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The boy replied, "<B>Yes, dad. Potentially, we're sitting on three million 
dollars, but realistically, we're living with two sluts and a poofter.</B>" </P>
