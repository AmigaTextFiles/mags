<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIke (<B>I dare say</B>) a lot of you, When I saw the Adverts for the Amstrad E-mailer Telephone, I smiled a little and thought to myself .... Who would want that?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well after all most people Now-a-days have mobile phones, Computers etc. Why would they also want this little creation. Retailing at around £99 (Currently half Price at around £50) It is certainly affordable, But still quite a bit of cash to spend IF you already have Internet access.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However my Wife has a love of Gadjets and the E-Mailer had caught her attention, Plus we really needed a new Telephone.
So off we went and Bought the E-mailer, Now after exploring it for a few months, I have to admit I am quite taken with it, It is 
an all in one Communications centre, Lovingly displayed in our living room.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Amstrad E-Mailer Plus comes in a Brushed Aluminium Design case, Slightly Larger than a standerd Dest top telephone. Of course the Extra is the LDC screen at the Top of the Base unit. The Telephone handset is confortable to hold and use. As seen in the Photo above a Small "qwerty" keyboard slides in and out  of the Front of the Base unit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Amstrad E-mailer comes with a lot more buttons than your standard Telephone unit (More about these later) and also has a "Cut down" version of the "qwerty" Keyboard along the Botton end of the Base unit.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As I have already said the handset is light and comfortable, Apart from your standard Telephone, E-Mailer also incorperates</P><BLOCKQUOTE>

(a)  Answer machine<BR>
(b) Mute Button<BR>
(c) Last Redial<BR>
(d) Hands free setting<BR>
(e) Caller display (if your telephone company has this feature)<BR>
(f) Call logs<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the fisrt four of these are pretty standard in telephones, The Call log is an excellent Function (If you have Teenagers) Allowing you to display the last 12 Calls "Either" Received or Transmitted.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The E-mailer telephone unit comes equiped with an In-built modem, Press the e-mail button and the modem starts dialing and you go on-line to send/receive emails. To write e-mails you use the small "qwerty" keyboard under the base unit.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can send various attachments with your e-mails, Including "gif" ,bmp & "jpg" pictures, Or Voicemail.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Users can set up seperate e-mail accounts for the Family, and instruct the E-mailer to check for mails on a daily basis, or not at all (if you prefer to check yourself)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Note:-</B> If you are typing an e-mail and the telephone rings, the mail message you were typing is saved until you answerthe call, so you can start where you left off.</P>

The Costs.<BR>
Each time you go on-line with your e-mailer, you pay a flat rate of 12p + the standard local call rate for your telephone service.<BR>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the e-mailer you can surf the Internet, However the mailer is designed to view <B>"WAP"</B> web-sites, and various graphic intense sites might not display properly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example of this ...I tried the <B>CRYPT</B> website, The lefthand selection of "link" buttons did not show up, however I was able to enter the latest issue of the <B>CRYPT</B> and view and read the various pages (Including "gif" animations). Problem site might be better displayed if you configure the E-mailer, not to display graphics.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your e-mailer you can go to the web-site and download a varied selection of Spectrum "<B>Classic"</B> games (Space invadors/Pacman etc)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that in fact, you <B>HIRE</B> these games at a cost. Anygame selected can be downloaded ( up to 16 games) the current cost is 25p for 1 hour OR 50p for 3 days .. After the time has lapsed the game is automatically deleted from your mailer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Games are viewed on the small LDC screen, and controled via the "qwerty" pull our keyboard. The games run well and the graphics are clearly visable on the small screen.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Note:-</B> once downloaded there is no extra cost for playing the game, and should the telephone ring while you are playing, the game automatically pauses to allow you to answer the call.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the Amstrad E-Mailer you can store up to 700 peoples details (phone number/address/e-mail). The address book function of the E-mailer is excellent. You enter the persons name ...Phone numbers (Home-Mobile-Office). Their postal address and their e-mail address.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A small point here ...You MUST include an e-mail address before the entry will be saved, Now if the person doesn't have an e-mail address, You have to fabricate one :- JohnSmith@John.com - Will allow you to save the details (Even although it is a non existant address)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have a persons details logged in the Address book, Life becomes very simple, For an Example say you wanted to contact "John Smith" ..simply type in (Phone body keyboard) "Jo" ...All the entries starting with this 2 letters will appear on the screen ...Using the keyboard scroll through them until you find John Smith ...Then select From HOME-MOBILE-OFFICE, The Mailer will then dial the relevent number and connect you.</P>

<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Printer</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BR>
A  well  featured B/W printer is available,  so you can print  all
your  messages for safe keeping.  There is no complicated set  up,
just  connect  the  printer cable (which comes with  the  printer)
into  the  back of the e-mailerplus,  connect the power  lead  and
youre ready to print.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Pocket Dock-it</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BR>
The  Pocket Dock-it is a handy-sized electronic address  book  and
calculator  which can be purchased for use with the  e-mailerplus.
When  plugged  into the docking station at  the  side  of  the  e-
mailerplus,  the names,  phone numbers and email addresses  stored
in  the e-mailerplus Address Book memory can be transferred to the
Pocket  Dock-it  for  you  to   take   out  and  about  with  you.
Additionally,  when you're on the move,  you can  use  the  Pocket
Dock-it  to take down new names,  numbers and email addresses  for
later transfer back to the e-mailerplus.<BR>
<BR>
The  Pocket Dock-it also protects against the accidental  deletion
of  Address  Book*  entries   on   the   e-mailerplus  -  in  such
circumstances  you can simply transfer the data  back  to  the  e-
mailerplus  from the Pocket Dock-it.  What's  more,   if  your  e-
mailerplus ever needs to be replaced by another unit,  you can use
the  Pocket  Dock-it  to  transfer  your  existing  Address  Book*
entries (as well as email account details)  to the replacement  e-
mailerplus.  *Postal addresses are not transferred to  the  Pocket
Dock-it from the Address Book Databank<BR>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Smart Media Cards</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BR>
Smart Media is digital solid state (no moving parts)  memory,  and
is  used  as  a  data  storage medium in  items  such  as  digital
cameras.   It  enables the user to add to the existing  memory  of
certain  digital devices.  By inserting a Smart Media card  in  to
the side of the e-mailerplus,  the user can store more email,  fax
and VoiceMail messages for later retrieval or archiving.  Received
and  sent  messages  actioned  whilst  the  smart  media  card  is
inserted  will  automatically be stored on the  Smart  Media  card
instead of the internal memory of the e-mailerplus.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><B>SmartCard</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BR>
A slot is provided at the side of your e-mailer to insert a Smartcard, (New generation of Bankcard) This allows you to Shop on-line or access your accout on-line.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=RED><B>Camera</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BR>
Amstrads e-sn@p Digital Camera (soon to be released) will interface with the Mailer, allowing you to send Digital Photos via the Internet.<BR>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well to be honest we have just scraped th surface of the functions of the e-mailer, Almost everything can be "tweeked" or set up to your liking. However is it a worthwhile Purchase?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well if you do not already have internet/e-mail access then <B>YES</B> a very simple way to get on line and have e-mail, But slightly costly (12p a session + your local calls per minute ..Although you do not have the hastle of ISP's ..setting up accounts ...Monthly standing charges)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you already have an on-line PC, Then of course you would use that for most internet work (browsing-mail). However the Amstrad e-mailer is a fantastic little gadjet to have in the home, An excellent telephone unit (with all the extras) and a very handy back-up, Should (a) your PC decide to die (c) Your ISP suffers problems.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At the special price (offer) of £50 it is an excellent buy and well worth concidering.</P>
