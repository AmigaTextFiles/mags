<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tired  of  constantly  being  broke,   and  stuck  in  an  unhappy
marriage,   a  young  husband decided to solve  both  problems  by
taking  out a large insurance policy on his wife (with himself  as
the beneficiary), and arranging to have her killed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  "friend  of  a  friend"  put him  in  touch  with  a  nefarious
underworld figure, who went by the name of "Artie."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Artie  explained to the husband that his going price for  snuffing
out  a spouse was 5,000 quid.  The husband said he was willing  to
pay that amount,  but that he wouldn't have any cash on hand until
he  could  collect his wife's insurance money.  Artie insisted  on
being  paid  SOMETHING up front.  The man opened  up  his  wallet,
displaying  the  single  pound coin  that  rested  inside.   Artie
sighed,   rolled his eyes,  and reluctantly agreed to  accept  the
quid as down payment for the dirty deed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  few  days  later,  Artie followed the man's wife to  the  local
Sainsbury's.  There,  he surprised her in the produce  department,
and  proceeded to strangle her with his gloved hands.  As the poor
unsuspecting  woman  drew her last breath,   and  slumped  to  the
floor,   the   manager   of   the   produce   department  stumbled
unexpectedly  onto  the scene.  Unwilling to leave  any  witnesses
behind,   Artie had no choice but to strangle the produce  manager
as  well.  Unknown to Artie,  the entire proceedings were captured
by hidden cameras and observed by the store's security guard,  who
immediately  called  the police.  Artie was  caught  and  arrested
before he could leave the store.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under intense questioning at the
police  station,  Artie revealed the sordid plan,   including  his
financial arrangements with the hapless husband.  And that is why,
the next day in the newspaper, the headline declared:
