<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jake was on his deathbed.  His wife Susan, was maintaining a vigil
by his side.  She held his fragile hand,  tears ran down her face.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her  praying roused him from his slumber.  He looked  up  and  his
pale  lips  began  to  move  slightly.   <B>'My  darling  Susan,</B>'  he
whispered.  'Hush,  my love,' she said.  'Rest. Shhh. Don't talk.'</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  was insistent.  '<B>Susan</B>,' he said in his tired voice.  <B>'I  have
something  I  must confess to you.' 'There's nothing to  confess,'</B>
replied the weeping Susan. 'Everything's all right, go to sleep.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">'<B>No,  no.  I must die in peace,  Susan.  I slept with your sister,
your best friend and your mother</B>.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">'I know,' she replied.  'That's why I poisoned you.'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An  Englishman an Irishman and a Scotsman were in a pub,   talking
about their sons.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"My son was born on St George's Day," commented the Englishman. "So we 
obviously decided to call him George." </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"That's a real coincidence," remarked the Scot.  "My son was  born
on  St Andrew's Day,  so obviously we decided to call him Andrew."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"That's  incredible,   what  a coincidence,"  said  the  Irishman.
"Exactly the same thing happened with my son, Pancake."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  woman walked up to a little old man rocking in a chair  on  his
porch.   "I couldn't help noticing how happy you look," she  said.
What's your secret for a long happy life?"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day," he said.  "I also do  a
gramme of charlie a day,  a spliff every night,  a case of whiskey
a  week,   eat junk food,  never exercise,  and do  pills  on  the
weekend."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"That's amazing," said the woman, "how old are you?'</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For all of you out there who've had to deal with an 
irate customer, this one is for you. It's a classic! </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent 
in Denver for being smart and funny, while making her 
point, when confronted with a passenger who probably 
deserved to fly as cargo. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A crowded United Airlines flight was cancelled. A 
single agent was rebooking a long line of inconvenienced 
travellers. Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way 
to the desk. He slapped his ticket on the counter and 
<B>"I HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS." </B></P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The agent replied, "I am sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to 
help you, but I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure 
we'll be able to work something out." </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The passenger was unimpressed. He asked loudly, so that 
the passengers behind him could hear, <B>"DO YOU HAVE 
ANY IDEA WHO I AM"</B>? Without hesitating, the agent 
smiled and grabbed her public address microphone, saying: </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"May I have your attention please, " she began, her voice 
heard clearly throughout the terminal. "We have a passenger 
here at Gate14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If anyone can help him find his identity, please come to Gate 
 14." </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man 
glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore <B>"F*** You!"</B>. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Without flinching, she smiled and said, "I'm sorry, sir, but  you'll 
have to get in line for that too." </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A couple attending an art exhibition at the National Gallery were 
staring at a portrait that had them completely confused.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The 
painting depicted three very black and totally naked men sitting on 
a park bench.Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in 
the middle had a pink penis.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The curator of the gallery realized 
that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered 
his assessment. He went on for nearly half an hour explaining how it 
depicted the sexual emasculation of African-Americans in a 
predominately white, patriarchal society. "In fact," he pointed out, 
"some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the 
cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in 
contemporary society."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After the curator left, a Scottish man 
approached the couple and said, "Would you like to know what the 
painting is really about?" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Now why would you claim to be more of an 
expert than the curator of the gallery?" asked the couple."</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">"Because 
I'm the guy who painted it," he replied. "In fact, there's no 
African-Americans depicted at all. They're just three Scottish 
coal-miners. The only difference is that Donald, in the middle, went 
home for lunch." </P>
