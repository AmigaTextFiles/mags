<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vodun  (a.k.a.  Vodoun,  Voudou,  Voodoo,  Sevi Lwa)  is  commonly
called  Voodoo by the public.  The name is traceable to an African
word  for  "spirit".  Vodun's can be directly traced to  the  West
African  Yoruba people who lived in 18th and 19th century Dahomey.
Its  roots  may  go  back  6,000 years in  Africa.   That  country
occupied parts of today's Togo,  Benin and Nigeria. Slaves brought
their religion with them when they were forcibly shipped to  Haiti
and other islands in the West Indies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vodun  was  actively  suppressed  during  colonial  times.   "Many
Priests  were  either  killed or imprisoned,   and  their  shrines
destroyed,   because   of   the   threat   they   posed  to  Euro-
Christian/Muslim dominion.  This forced some of the  Dahomeans  to
form  Vodou Orders and to create underground societies,  in  order
to continue the veneration of their ancestors,  and the worship of
their  powerful  gods."  Vodun was again  suppressed  during  the
Marxist regime.  However,  it has been freely practiced  in  Benin
since  a democratic government was installed there in 1989.  Vodun
was  formally recognized as Benin's official religion in 1996-FEB.
It  is  also followed by most of the adults in Haiti.  It  can  be
found  in many of the large cities in North America,  particularly
in the American South.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today  over 60 million people practice Vodun worldwide.  Religions
similar  to  Vodun can be found in South America  where  they  are
called Umbanda, Quimbanda or Candomble. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Today, there are two virtually unrelated forms of the religion:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the  actual  religion,   Vodun   practiced  in  Benin,   Dominican
Republic,  Ghana,  Haiti,  Togo and various centers in  the  US  -
largely where Haitian refuges have settled.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  evil,  imaginary religion,  which we will call Voodoo.  It has
been  created for Hollywood movies,  complete with "voodoo dolls",
violence,  bizarre rituals,  etc.  It does not exist  in  reality,
except in the minds of most non-Voduns.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Slaves  were  baptized into the Roman Catholic Church  upon  their
arrival  in Haiti and other West Indian islands.  However,   there
was  little Christian infrastructure present during the early 19th
century  to  maintain the faith.  The result was that  the  slaves
largely followed their original native faith.  This they practiced
in secret, even while attending Mass regularly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  inaccurate and sensational book (S.  St.  John,  "Haiti or the
Black  Republic")  was written in 1884.  It described Vodun  as  a
profoundly  evil  religion,  and included  lurid  descriptions  of
human  sacrifice,  cannibalism,  etc.,  some  of  which  had  been
extracted  from Vodun priests by torture.  This  book  caught  the
imagination  of  people   outside   the   West  Indies,   and  was
responsible  for much of the misunderstanding  and  fear  that  is
present  today.   Hollywood found this a rich  source  for  Voodoo
screen  plays.   Horror movies began in the  1930's  and  continue
today  to  misrepresent Vodun.  It is only since the  late  1950's
that accurate studies by anthropologists have been published.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other religions (Macumba,  Candomble,  Umbanda and Santeria)  bear
many similarities to Vodun.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vodun,  like Christianity,  is a religion of many traditions. Each
group  follows a different spiritual path and worships a  slightly
different  pantheon  of  spirits,  called  Loa.   The  word  means
"mystery" in the Yoruba language.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yoruba  traditional belief included a chief God  Olorun,   who  is
remote  and  unknowable.  He authorized a lesser  God  Obatala  to
create  the  earth and all life forms.  A battle between  the  two
Gods led to Obatala's temporary banishment.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are hundreds of minor spirits.  Those which originated  from
Dahomey  are  called Rada;  those who were added later  are  often
deceased leaders in the new world and are called Petro.   Some  of
these are</P><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There  are  a  number  of  points   of  similarity  between  Roman
Catholicism and Vodun:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both believe in a supreme being.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Loa resemble Christian Saints,  in that they were once people
who  led  exceptional  lives,  and  are  usually  given  a  single
responsibility or special attribute.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both believe in an afterlife.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both  have,   as  the centerpiece of some of their ceremonies,   a
ritual sacrifice and consumption of flesh and blood.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Both believe in the existence of invisible evil spirits or demons.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Followers of Vodun believe that each person has a met tet  (master
of the head) which corresponds to a Christian's patron saint.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Followers  of Vodun believe that each person has a soul  which  is
composed  of two parts:  a gros bon ange or "big guardian  angel",
and  a  ti bon ange or "little guardian angel".  The latter leaves
the  body during sleep and when the person is possessed by  a  Loa
during a ritual.  There is a concern that the ti bon ange  can  be
damaged or captured by evil sorcery while it is free of the body.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  purpose of rituals is to make contact with a spirit,  to gain
their  favor  by offering them animal sacrifices  and  gifts,   to
obtain help in the form of more abundant food,  higher standard of
living,   and  improved health.  Human and Loa  depend  upon  each
other;  humans provide food and other materials;  the Loa  provide
health,   protection from evil spirits and good fortune.   Rituals
are held to celebrate lucky events,  to attempt to escape a run of
bad  fortune,   to  celebrate   a   seasonal  day  of  celebration
associated with a Loa, for healing, at birth, marriage and death.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vodun priests can be male (houngan or hungan),  or female (mambo).
A  Vodun temple is called a hounfour (or humfort).  At its  center
is  a  poteau-mitan  a pole where the God and spirits  communicate
with  the  people.   An altar will be elaborately  decorated  with
candles,  pictures of Christian saints,  symbolic items related to
the Loa, etc. Rituals consist of some of the following components:</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">a feast before the main ceremony</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">creation of a veve,  a pattern of flour or cornmeal on  the  floor
which is unique to the Loa for whom the ritual is to be conducted</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">shaking  a  rattle and beating drums which have been cleansed  and
purified</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">chanting</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">dancing  by  the  houngan and/or mambo and the  hounsis  (students
studying  Vodun).  The dancing will typically build  in  intensity
until one of the dancers (usually a hounsis)  becomes possessed by
a  Loa and falls.  His or her ti bon ange has left their body  and
the spirit has taken control.  The possessed dancer will behave as
the  Loa  and is treated with respect and ceremony by  the  others
present.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">animal sacrifice;</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">this may be a goat,  sheep,  chicken,  or  dog.
They  are usually humanely killed by slitting their throat;  blood
is collected in a vessel.  The possessed dancer may drink some  of
the  blood.   The  hunger  of the  Loa  is  then  believed  to  be
satisfied.   The  animal  is usually  cooked  and  eaten.   Animal
sacrifice  is  a  method of consecrating food for  consumption  by
followers of Vodun, their gods and ancestors.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  houngan and mambos confine their activities to "white"  magic
which is used to bring good fortune and healing.  However caplatas
(also  known  as  bokors)  perform acts of evil sorcery  or  black
magic,  sometimes called "left-handed Vodun".  Rarely,  a  houngan
will  engage in such sorcery;  a few alternate between  white  and
dark magic.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  belief unique to Vodun is that a dead person can  be  revived
after having been buried.  After resurrection,  the zombie has  no
will  of their own,  but remains under the control of others.   In
reality,  a zombie is a living person who has never died,  but  is
under  the  influence of powerful drugs administered  by  an  evil
sorcerer.   Although most Haitians believe in zombies,   few  have
ever seen one.  There are a few recorded instances of persons  who
have claimed to be zombies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sticking  pins  in "voodoo dolls" was once used  as  a  method  of
cursing  an individual by some followers of Vodun in New  Orleans;
this  practice  continues  occasionally  in  South  America.   The
practice became closely associated with Voodoo in the public  mind
through the vehicle of horror movies.</P>
