<CENTER>I<B>'m not a pheasant plucker, I'm a pheasant plucker's son</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I'm only plucking pheasants 'till the pheasant plucker comes.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Me husband is a keeper, he's a very busy man</CENTER>
<CENTER>I try to understand him and I help him all I can,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But sometimes in an evening I feel a trifle dim</CENTER>
<CENTER>All alone, I'm plucking pheasants, when I'd rather pluck with him.</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>I'm not a pheasant plucker, I'm a pheasant plucker's mate</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I'm only plucking pheasants 'cos the pheasant plucker's late !</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>I'm not good at plucking pheasants, at pheasant plucking I get stuck</CENTER>
<CENTER>Though some pheasants find it pleasant I'd rather pluck a duck.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Oh plucking geese is gorgeous, I can pluck a goose with ease</CENTER>
<CENTER>But pheasant plucking's torture because they haven't any grease.</CENTER>

<CENTER>You have to pluck them fresh, if its fresh theyre not unpleasant,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I knew a man in Dunstable who could pluck a frozen pheasant.</CENTER>
<CENTER>They say the village constable had pheasant plucking sessions</CENTER>
<CENTER>With the vicar on a Sunday tween the first and second lessons.</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>I'm not a pheasant plucker, I'm a pheasant plucker's mum</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I'm only plucking pheasants 'till the pheasant plucker's come.</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>My good friend Godfrey is most adept, he's really got the knack</CENTER>
<CENTER>He likes to have a pheasant plucked before he hits the sack.</CENTER>
<CENTER>I like to give a helping hand, I gather up the feathers,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's really all our pheasant plucking keeps us pair together.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>I'm not a pheasant plucker, I'm a pheasant plucker's friend</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I'm only plucking pheasants as a means unto an end !</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>My husband's in the forest always banging with his gun</CENTER>
<CENTER>If he could hear me half the time I'm sure that he would run,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For there's fluff in all my crannies, there's feathers up my nose</CENTER>
<CENTER>And I'm itching in the kitchen from my head down to my toes.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>I'm not a pheasant plucker, I'm a pheasant plucker's wife</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And when we pluck together it's a pheasant plucking life !</B></CENTER>
