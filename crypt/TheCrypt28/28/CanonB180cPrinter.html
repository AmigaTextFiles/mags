<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  the  <B>B180C</B>  you  can have affordable fax  communication  and
convenient colour printing from the desktop.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Replacing  the popular B155,  the B180C is a fully featured  entry
level fax that can also colour print via a USB connection to  your
PC.   Using  Canon's reliable Bubble Jet print  engine  the  B180C
delivers high image quality,  a print resolution of 720x360dpi, 64
shades  of  grey halftone,  and a speed of 5ppm (mono)   and  2ppm
(colour)   -  meaning  you can have a versatile,   affordable  and
convenient solution for your small or home office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fax  features include a full 14.4Kbps modem for a  fast  6  second
per  page  transmission speed that saves communication  costs  and
time.   The enlarged fax memory enables 42 pages to be  stored  if
the  unit runs out of ink or paper,  and facilitates advanced  fax
features  such as sequential transmission - so you  can  send  the
same fax to multiple destinations. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For added convenience,  the B180C comes with a push button handset
and  an inbuilt fax/tel switch.  12 one touch and 100 coded  dials
can  be  stored  for  quick dialling,  and the B180C  incorporates
automatic  and manual redial,  and an on-hook key.  You  can  also
choose to connect an answer phone to your B180C.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reliable  paper  handling  features  include  a  100  sheet  paper
capacity  -  reducing the need to add paper so often,   and  a  20
sheet  auto  document  feeder for added convenience  when  sending
multiple page documents.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  B180C  uses either the BX20 or BC21e cartridges -  which  are
quick  and easy to replace,  and operate in conjunction  with  the
B180C's ink saver mode so that you can keep costs at a minimum.</P>
