<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fresh smelling home is a pleasant home to be in; it lifts spirits and can 
make you feel better even on rough days.  Unfortunately, daily life can leave 
your home smelling not so fresh.  Fried foods and pets are just a couple of 
things out of many that keep your home from smelling fresh and these smells 
can make a person irritable, so it is worth it to rid the odors and bring in 
the aromas.  Here are a few tips to help you rid unwanted odors and get your 
home smelling fresh<B>:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~</B> If it's not too cold outside, open the front and back door of your home to 
air out any stale air.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~</B> Soak a cotton ball with essential or aroma oil, perfume or vanilla and put 
it into your clean vacuum bag or canister.  When you vacuum, it will release 
the scent.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~</B> Dab essential or aroma oil onto light bulbs; when they are turned on, the 
heat of the bulb will release the aroma.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~</B> If you have odors from cooking lingering, be sure to clean up the cooking 
mess as soon as possible; this will help the odors to dissipate sooner.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~</B> Candles nowadays can be richly scented.  I like the ones in jars because 
you can simply remove the lid to release the aroma of the candle rather than 
burn it.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>~ </B>Car air fresheners aren't only for cars... hang them from lamp switches, 
kitchen cupboard knobs or other hangable places.</P>
