  Crypties, Steve Hyde here again, y`know, I was sitting at my computer the other 
  night, just after doing one of my fav things (no Zola, I don`t know the 10 year 
  old lad who`s called John Bates, formerly known as Master Bates), anyway, as 
  I was saying, I was at my computer, and seriously thinking that it was about 
  time I got my preverbal finger out of my preverbial arse &amp; wrote an article, 
  but what could I write about? God I wish Dr Jekyll was here, he`d help me out, 
  he`s a bit of a clever sod in the article writing area sometimes, but alas, 
  he wasn`t here, he was at his fortnightly meeting of the local “I Used To Love 
  Kylie Minogue, But I`m Getting Over It Now” counseling service…shame though.</span></i></font></b></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>  <font size="+1">  
  </font></span><font size="+1">This particular night when I was sitting at my 
  computer, I remember it well, it was the very same night that my shrink had 
  increased my medication from 6 tablets twice at day to 8 three times a day before 
  meals, and before having sex with a female or myself, and sometimes I see Tangerine 
  trees and Marmalade Skies, and imagining I was at the Seaside I could see Newspaper 
  Taxi`s that appeared on the shore, ready to take you away (hmmm, those tablets 
  are a bloody lot stronger, I just imagined something else strange &amp; horrible, 
  Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell from Eastenders) in a Basque, Stockings &amp; 
  <span class=SpellE>sussy`s</span>, <span class=SpellE>crutchless</span> leather 
  pants &amp; a leather peep-hole bra, holding a whip……yuk, scary, I hate whips.</font></i></font></b></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>Anyway, as per usual, I digress from the semi-normality of life &amp; 
  venture in the inner-most dark realms of my own very disturbed mind, where, 
  “ANYTHING” is possible, such as me being normal, tall dark &amp; handsome, but 
  one out of 4 isn`t too bad, or Boy George just announcing that he had stopped 
  being gay, or Michael Jackson announcing that in fact the real Michael Jackson 
  had disappeared up his own anus some years ago with all the cosmetic lifts &amp; 
  tucks he was having done, and in fact it was really “Bubbles” who had taken 
  his identity over.</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>So, there I was this particular night, sitting at my computer, after 
  a hard days night, sorry, a hard days work, eating my broken glass &amp; banana 
  sandwich, which is very strange really folks, because I used to hate banana`s, 
  but I know a young girl who does, but that`s a totally different story, and 
  one you`ll most probably never hear from me.</i></font></b></font></p>

  </span>Right, enough of this none-sensible crap, on with the matter at hand, 
  my article, so, for the 15<sup>th</sup> million time, I was sitting at my computer 
  thinking of what to write my next article about, when I hear this little voice 
  (no, my tablets hadn`t quite kicked in yet, well, I don`t think so anyway), 
  I thought this little voice was possibly kids playing football in our flats 
  private car park, then I suddenly realized “You Prat, it’s 9.15 pm, it’s as 
  dark as a black-mans <span class=SpellE>arse</span> out there”, so I soon realized 
  that this little voice wasn’t kids, I listened again when this little voice 
  spoke, and it seemed to be coming right from in front of me, and sounding silly 
  now, but it sounded as though it was coming from my Logitech <span
class=SpellE>iTouch</span> internet keyboard.</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>Now you prat I thought, those tablets must have kicked in by now, so 
  I slapped my face a bit to hopefully bring myself out of this pre-maddened state, 
  then this voice said “What’s the matter Steve, don’t u believe in US”, “US? 
  I said, and who is US? not fairies? yep I do believe in fairies, one of my old 
  school classmates was a fairy, but a different sort of fairy”, “No, we’re not 
  fairies, we’re your computer family,”!</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>“My computer WHAT?”, I said, “Your computer family”, the voice replied, 
  “Ok, so, who are you”, I asked very cagey, “Well, you might know us only in 
  the past-tense of the items u paid for over the past few months, keyboard, monitor, 
  floppy drive, joystick, BT broadband modem, etc, but really Steve, we are a 
  family”, “Yeah, sure”, I replied, “Ok then, if you’re a computer family, what 
  are your real names?” I asked….</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>“Do you really want to know then Steve? asked the little voice”, “Yep 
  I do”, “Ok” it replied, “I’m Kevin Board, but you can call me <span class=SpellE>k.board</span>”, 
  and after saying this, two little eyes opened up on the ESC &amp; Pause/Break 
  keys on the keyboard, and a long slender grin appeared on the wrist rest, “Shit 
  I thought, I’m getting madder by the minute”, “So, <span class=SpellE>k.board</span>, 
  who’s the rest of your family” I asked sounding like a madman”.</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>“Well, there’s <span class=SpellE>Joy.S.Tick</span>, but she prefers 
  to be called <span class=SpellE>j.stick</span>, then there’s our Greek friend 
  <span
class=SpellE>Mon.Itor</span>, then there’s <span class=SpellE>Mo.Dem</span>, then 
  a lad that we’ve all know for ages, but he’s got a sexual medical problem, so 
  we simply call him “Floppy”, Joy knows more about that”.</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>Then there’s, <span class=SpellE>Ugene</span> Sebastian Bartholomew the 
  3<sup>rd</sup>, which is a bloody big mouthful, so we’ve shortened to just USB, 
  then there’s our brainy Russian friend of our family who’s called <span
class=SpellE>Cecil.Peter.Ustinov</span>, again, we’ve shortened it to just CPU, 
  then there’s a m8 who you hold every day in your left hand (please, no rude 
  remarks Zola or Ferret or Ian U or anyone, I’ve cut down to only 3 times per 
  week now, I was getting a little short-sighted), I asked <span class=SpellE>k.board</span> 
  who this other person was, “<span class=SpellE>Maddison.Ouse</span>, we think 
  he’s Dutch, but like the other two, we’ve shortened it to Mouse for your benefit”.</i></font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><span>    
  </span>“Then there’s our Asian friend called “RAM”, but I reckon he’s got medical 
  <span class=SpellE>probs</span> <span class=SpellE>cos</span>` he stays in every 
  day, there’s also <span class=SpellE>David.Vincent.Devere</span>, but for obvious 
  reason’s, Steve we all simply call him DVD, and apart from the “BIG BOSS”, of 
  which we’ve never known his real name, but has told him to call him XP, that’s 
  our computer family………………….</i></font></b></font></p>
