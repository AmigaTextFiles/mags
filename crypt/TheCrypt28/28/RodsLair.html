<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  name is Rod Shelley,  and I am an artist & photographer  based
in  the  Kansas  City,  Missouri area.  I enjoy  most  aspects  of
photography,  and have done commercial,  landscape,   and  glamour
photography.   I have been actively involved in photography  since
1987.  I served as Chairman and was a founding member of the  K.C.
Metro  Photographer's  Assn.  (formerly  Northeast  Photographer's
Assn.). </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I retired from chairing the KCMPA at the end of 2001.   I
am  also  a  past  board  member of the Society  for  Contemporary
Photography.  In addition to photography, I enjoy creating artwork
with  many  other  tools.  When I have  time,   I  enjoy  airbrush
painting,   watercolor painting,  drawing & sketching  in  various
media,  and of course,  computer based art. I also enjoy traveling
and collecting insulators.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These  images  are  the result of 8 years in the  retail  computer
industry  - 8 years that are thankfully behind me.  After  working
as  a  technician in a retail store for a famous computer  company
(think  cows),  I was let go in August of 2002 because I  believed
it  was  better to do a quality repair job rather than just format
& reload no matter what the real problem is. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I didn't know at the
time what a great favor they did me by letting me go.  Now I  have
a  good job that pays at least as well,  and I don't have to  work
weekends! But..... I digress......</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At any rate,  there probably won't be any further images added  to
this gallery,  since I have no intention of getting back into  the
computer/retail industry.  I'll soak my clothes in gasoline,   and
march  through hell first!  I had considered taking  this  gallery
down,  but it seems that many people get a lot of enjoyment out of
it  <B>-</B>  so here it shall stay!  I want to thank all of you who have
written me about the photos <B>-</B> I am glad you enjoyed them!</P>
