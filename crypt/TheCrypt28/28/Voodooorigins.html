<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly this vision that has stuck in all our minds, Is actually a fabrication from America's Hollywood (The home of fiction and movies). What people do not realise is VOODOO is actually a recognised Religion, Not a method of Cursing the Dammed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voodoo is probably the best example of African syncretism  in  the
Americas.   Although its essential wisdom originated in  different
parts  of  Africa  long  before the Europeans  started  the  slave
trade,  the structure of Voodoo,  as we know it today, was born in
Haiti during the European colonization of Hispaniola.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ironically,   it  was the enforced immigration of  African  slaves
from  different  tribes that provided the  circumstances  for  the
development  of  Voodoo.   European   colonists  thought  that  by
desolating  the  tribes,   these could  not  come  together  as  a
community.   However,  in the misery of slavery,  the transplanted
Africans found in their faith a common thread.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They  began  to invoke not only their own gods,  but  to  practice
rites other than their own.  In this process,  they comingled  and
modified rituals of various tribes.  The result of such fusion was
that  the  different  religious groups integrated  their  beliefs,
thereby  creating  a  new  religion:  Voodoo,   an  Afro-Caribbean
religion that mixed practices from the Fon,  the Nago,  the  Ibos,
Dahomeans,  Congos,  Senegalese,  Haussars,  Caplaous, Mondungues,
Mandinge, Angolese, Libyans, Ethiopians, and the Malgaches.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  strength  that  the  Africans  in  Haiti  gained  from  their
religion  was  so  strong and powerful,  that they  were  able  to
survive  the  cruel  persecution  of  the  French  rulers  against
Voodoo.   When  the  French realized  that  the  religion  of  the
Africans was a threat to the colonial system,  they prohibited all
African    religion   practices   and   severely   punished    the
practitioners of Voodoo with imprisoments,  lashings and hangings.
This  religious struggle continued for three centuries,  but  none
of  the  punishments could extinguished the faith of the  Africans
who kept their religion in secret.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  was  in  the  midst of this struggle that the  revolution  was
conspired.  The Voodoo priests consulted their oracle and  learned
how  the  political battle would have to be fought  in  order  for
them  to be victorious.  The revolution exploited in 1791  with  a
Petr  ritual  and continued until 1804 when the Haitians  finally
won indepedence.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today  the system of Voodoo reflects its history.  We can see  the
tribal  mixture  in  the  names of  different  rites  and  in  the
pantheon  of gods which is composed of deities from all  parts  of
Africa.</P>
