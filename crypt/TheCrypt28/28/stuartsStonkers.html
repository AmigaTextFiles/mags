<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sheila was having a shower and slipped over on the bathroom floor. Instead
of slipping over forwards or backwards, she slipped, did the splits and
suctioned herself to the floor.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She yelled out for her husband Bruce. "<B>Bruce! Bruce!</B>" she yelled.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bruce came running in. "<B>Bruce, I've bloody suctioned myself to the floor</B>"
she said. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Strewth!</I>" Bruce said and tried to pull her up. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>You're stuck fast girl. I'll go across the road and get Bluey</I>" (his mate). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They came back and they both tried to pull her up. "<I>No way. We can't do it</I>"
Bluey said "Lets try Plan B." </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Plan B?" exclaimed Bruce. "What's that"? </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>I'll go home and get my hammer and chisel and we'll break the tiles under
her.</I>" "Spot on" Bruce said. "While your doing that, I'll stay here and play
with her tits."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Play with her tits</I>"? Bluey said, "<I>Not exactly a good time for that mate</I>"?</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"No" Bruce replied, "But I reckon if I can get her wet enough, we can slide
her into the kitchen where the tiles aren't so expensive!"</P>

What's the difference between a penis and a prick? <BR>
A penis is fun, sexy and satisfying.... A prick is the bloke who owns it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Why do men masturbate?<BR> 
It's sex with someone they love. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Men are like ....... <BR>
<B>Placemats</B> - they only show up when there's food on the table. <BR>
<B>Mascara</B> - they usually run at the first sign of emotion. <BR>
<B>Bike Helmets</B> - handy in an emergency, but otherwise they just look silly.<BR> 
<B>Parking Spaces </B>- the good ones are taken, and the rest are too small. <BR>
<B>Photocopiers </B>- you need them for reproduction, but that's about it. <BR>
<B>Lava lamps </B>- fun to look at, but not all that bright. <BR>
<B>Bananas</B> - the older they get, the less firm they are. <BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A husband and wife were staying in a hotel, and after a romantic evening
wining and dining they go off to bed. However, as soon as they settle down
the man leans over and whispers softly, <B>"Hey snuggle boopy boops, your
lickle hubby wubby isn't quite ready for bye-byes yet."</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wife take the hint and says, "OK, but I have to use the bathroom first."
Off she goes but on her way back she trips over a piece of carpet and lands
flat on her face. Her husband jumps up and exclaims in a concerned tone <B>"Oh
my little honey bunny, is your nosey-wosey all right?" </B>No harm is done, so
she jumps into bed and they have mad passionate sex for three hours.
Afterwards, the wife goes off to the bathroom again, but on her way back
she trips over the same piece of carpet and again land flat on her face on
the floor. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Her husband looks over and grunts "<B>Clumsy bitch.</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Two 90 year olds had been dating for a while, when the man told the woman, 
"<B>Well tonight's the night we have sex!</B>"</P> 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">And so they did.</P> 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As they are lying in bed afterwards, the man thinks to himself, 
"My God, if I knew she was a virgin, I would have been much more gentle with
her!" </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">And the woman was thinking to herself, "My God, if I knew the old git could
actually get it up, I would have taken off my tights!" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well documented that for every minute that you exercise, you add one
minute to your life. This enables you at 85 years old to spend an
additional 5 months in a nursing home at $5000 per month. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. Now she's
97 years old and we don't know where the hell she is. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only reason I would take up exercising is so that I could hear heavy
breathing again. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks. Haven't lost a
pound. Apparently you have to go there. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to exercise early in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm
doing. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.</P> 



<P ALIGN="LEFT">And last but not least:    I don't exercise because it makes the ice jump
right out of my glass. </P>
