<CENTER>This is the story of David Mc. D,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who was in a hurry to get home for tea,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Despite all the teachings of <B>"The Green Cross Code"</B></CENTER>
<CENTER>Regretfully ran out straight into the road.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/bus.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="84" HEIGHT="60" ALT="Bus.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>From the on-coming bus he had no escape,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Even tho' the bus driver did rapidly brake,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A quick glancing blow,  sent him over the road,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There to be found like a little black toad.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/hippiedrunk.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="drunk.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And then up he got,  and ran straight back to home,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The coach driver following;  he wasn't alone,</CENTER>
<CENTER>An ambulance summoned,  by some means or other,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Whoever you are,  well, our thanks to you, brother.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/paramedic.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="110" ALT="ambulance.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>To the nearest hospital to deal with such things</CENTER>
<CENTER>We shot off in haste like we all had got wings,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With him apologising for the blood on his shirt,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We were far more concerned about "where did it hurt?"</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Despite his injuries he was in a jovial mood,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Even though he hadn't eaten a  scrap of food,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With stitches in his top lip,  he was then heard to say,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Another Michael Jackson we do not need today."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/nurse.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="100" ALT="nurse.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And then a crooked smile appeared on his face,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Any chance of having a good wheelchair race?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>With so many X-rays to be undergone,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's a wonder he wasn't glowing like the Sun !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Then on to be plastered;  before Christmas too,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And then came the worry of what we should do.</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Solid food is out, he's too tender by far,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Guess it's nowt more than drinks", as we got in the car.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And as we went homeward all tuckered and rent,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With t'lad whose face was now incredibly bent</CENTER>
<CENTER>More trips to the hospital there'll be for sure,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Prevention is better by far than the cure.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>This poem's intention is not to lose face,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But a wee safety measure to put into place,</CENTER>
<CENTER>About how it's so easy to suffer such pain,</CENTER>
<CENTER>That's one thing that young <B>David</B> just won't do again !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>At one stage he asked this not be put in print,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But later has realised teaching from his stint-</CENTER>
<CENTER>The one way to stop a bus is with your arm,</CENTER>
<CENTER>That method's guaranteed to keep you from harm !!</CENTER>
