<CENTER>Our generation grew up to respect the Golden Rule,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The present one can never ever be found at school,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Disruptive and law-wise are they, and know these off by heart,</CENTER>
<CENTER>God knows how humans will behave, when they play their part!</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>They drink, take drugs, and rob folk of whatever they can sell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A night of senseless vandalism they do very well;</CENTER>
<CENTER>Illegalities know no bounds, for them it's just a laugh,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The British Justice system just makes me want to barf.</CENTER>

<CENTER>A Judge called Wilfred Pickles, would meter justice well,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The gibbet in the courtyard knew of him, you could tell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The morale of his summing up was clear for all to see,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Don't break the Law or otherwise you'll be  in front of me.</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>But nowadays, the Law has changed; it's terribly gone crass,</CENTER>
<CENTER>They may as well congratulate the down and outing class,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For being thieves or rapists, or something even worse,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Society lacking discipline - is worse than any curse !</CENTER>
