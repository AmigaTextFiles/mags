<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man is lying in bed in a Catholic hospital with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young auxiliary nurse appears to sponge his face and hands. "<B>Nurse</B>," he mumbles from behind the mask, "<B>Are my testicles black?</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Embarrassed the young nurse replies, "<I>I don't know sir, I'm only here to wash your face and hands.</I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He struggles again to ask, "<B>Nurse, Are my testicles black?</B>"  Again the nurse replies, "<I>I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands.</I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The ward sister was passing and saw the man getting a little distraught so she marched over to inquire what was wrong. "<B>Sister</B>," he mumbled, "<B>Are my testicles black?</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Being a nurse of longstanding, the sister was undaunted.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">She whipped back the bedclothes, pulled down his pajama trousers, moved his penis out of the way, had a right good look, pulled up the pajamas, replaced the bedclothes and announced, "Nothing wrong with them!!!" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At this the man pulled off his oxygen mask and asked again, "<B>Are my test results back???</B> </P>
