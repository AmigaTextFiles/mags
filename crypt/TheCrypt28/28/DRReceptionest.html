<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The receptionist replied, "<B>You've obviously caused some
embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is
something wrong with your ear or something and then discussed the problem
further with  the doctor in private.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, "<B>Yes?</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>There's something wrong with my ear,</I>" he stated.</P>

advice. "<B>And what is wrong with your ear, Sir?</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>I can't piss out of it,</B></I>" the man replied.</P>
