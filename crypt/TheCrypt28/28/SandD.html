  <h1><center><font color=red> Search and Destroy </font></center></h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As you know, I tried out Ad-Aware some time ago, and a boon it has proved 
    to be.</p>
<p>However, the reference update file hasn’t been updated for quite a while.</p>
<p>This has meant that more (and newer ) spyware can’t be detected at present 
  by Ad-Aware. So what to do now?</p>
<p>Well, there are a number of other programs that do the same job. I had a look 
  around and came up with  Search and Destroy.</p>
<p> <img width=501 height=383
src="Images/SandD1.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
<p>Search and Destroy has no evil surprises when installing…………and, a nice touch, 
  the programmer dedicates his software to the most wonderful girl on Earth. Lucky 
  girl <span>J</span></p>
<p> <img width=417 height=319

<p> <img width=384 height=293
src="Images/SandD3.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>Search and Destroy has quite a few other features apart from detecting spyware.</p>
<p> <img width=331 height=122
src="Images/SandD4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>It has a function to check for an update, for instance. S&amp;D isn’t using 
  a reference file but has it coded internally.</p>
<p>It has tools built in …………</p>
<p> <img width=456 height=411
src="Images/SandD5.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>such as the “secure shredder” for files that you would rather weren’t  able 
  to be brought back.</p>
<p>The tools also include letting you see the tasks in your startup……..and helps 
  explain what they are and if you need them. </p>
<p>It has a recovery option as has Ad-Aware, so you can remove files and then 
  restore them if they upset your machine.</p>
<p> <img width=469 height=333
src="Images/SandD6.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>S&amp;D has lots of little popups that help explain the program and help with 
  options and program files it will let you delete.</p>
<p>The program also comes with its help system .</p>
<p> <img width=550 height=450
src="Images/SandD7.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>It is a very useful program and will happily delete all those nasty spyware 
  programs on your drive.</p>
<p>Another handy little thing it does is remove your tracks on the drive e.g. 
  the most recently opened files listings in programs.</p>
<p>This will clean last opened directory, files etc from most programs.</p>
<p>Its as well to double click on a file that it gives the option to delete, the 
  information it gives may well help stop you having to recover files…….</p>
<p> <img width=553 height=392
src="Images/SandD8.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
  <p>You can also disclude something that S&amp;D would rather destroy simply by 
    going through its extensive lists and marking them as excluded.</p>
  <p>How well does the program work? Well, its fast, and most informative when you 
    run it. It does get rid of a vast list of spyware, but I would check for updates 
    regularly. All these programs are like virus checkers, they are only as good 
    as the latest version……and spyware like virii are always getting updated.</p>
<p>Give this one a go and see if its to your taste.</p>
