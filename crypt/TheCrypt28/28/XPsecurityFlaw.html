<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows  guru  <B>Brian Livingston</B> reports that inserting  a  Windows
2000  CD  into  an  XP  system allows one to bypass  all  password
protection  and  manipulate any  part  of  the  machine  at  will.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>Anyone  with a Windows 2000 CD can boot up a Windows XP  box  and
start  the  Windows 2000 Recovery Console,</I>" says Livingston.   The
intruder has Administrator privileges even if he or she  does  not
provide a password,  and can also assume the identity of any other
user of the machine.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>I  notified four Microsoft executives of the XP flaw  weeks  ago,
but  haven't   yet   received   an   official   response,</I>"  writes
Livingston.   "<I>There's no Knowledge Base article  about  it,   and
there may not even be a good solution to the problem.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While one does need physical access to the machine to exploit  the
flaw,   this  will  be  little comfort to  the  administrators  of
academic  computer laboratories and other facilities  where  users
can easily pop a CD-ROM into a computer.</P>
