<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>We're  in  a  recession,  and perhaps your  business  is  slightly
slower  than usual.  But it's always a good time to take stock  of
what's working for you,  and what needs some attention - including
your Web site!</I></P>




<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Here  are my suggestions for a great tune-up audit - take a  fresh
look  at  your  site  and  your promotional  strategy  with  these
pointers</I>:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1.. Is your site appealing to all your markets?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do  you  have different potential buyers for different aspects  of
your  products and services? Is there content on your site  that's
designed for each of these? Have you considered whether  your  Web
audience might be different from your traditional markets,  and if
so, whether you can exploit that?</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2.. Does your content engage your visitors?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your  site  should be written from your visitors' point  of  view,
not  yours.  Does your home page clearly recognize why the  reader
might be there - what's in it for them,  and why they should care?
What  are  the problems or issues that they might have,   and  how
will you solve them?</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3.. Can you make your case?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you claim that your products or services achieve results,   do
you  have clear content on your site that substantiates  this?  Do
you have case studies,  sample client lists, and testimonials from
happy customers? Third party endorsements are worth far more  than
your  own  promotional text,  and they should be spread throughout
your  site,   not relegated to a separate page that  few  visitors
will go to.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.. Do you position yourself as an expert?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  of  the  most effective ways to get exposure  is  to  publish
articles,  and white papers around your area of expertise. Even if
you  sell widgets,  you can help people get the most out of  using
them!   Articles  on your site will be picked  up  by  the  search
engines,   and you can also offer them to publications  that  your
target  markets read - always with a link back,  or  reference  to
your site, of course.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5.. Do you ask for the business?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the outcomes that you want from your site,  you  need  to
ask for it.  Too many Web pages end weakly, with no clear calls to
action.  Don't make your visitors have to work to decide  what  to
do  next  -  they won't!  Every page on your site  should  have  a
strategy - invite the visitor to interact with you,  or go to  the
next page, but make it easy and obvious.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>6.. Do you have a diversified promotional strategy?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't  depend on free search engines to get you traffic.  Are  you
exploring other ways of promoting your site - such as  using  your
content  and  articles,   advertising  in  e-zines,   appending  a
signature file to your e-mail,  regularly sending updates to  your
database,   and  ensuring  that   your  traditional  marketing  is
integrated with your online activities?</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>7.. Are you reviewing your traffic analysis?</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last,  but really key - your Website traffic reports will tell you
what's  working and what isn't.  Without this information,  you're
really  shooting in the dark - what if you were to find  that  the
majority  of your hard-earned visitors never go beyond  your  home
page?</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This isn't an exhaustive list,  but it's a good start. I hope that
your Web site passes the test!</P>
