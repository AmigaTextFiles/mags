<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New  illumination feature and sleek flip-screen design  making  it
the  most distinctively stylish,  compact and portable Game  Boy
system  ever.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW YORK,  Jan. 7, 2003  The biggest star in the history of video
games is getting even brighter. Nintendo of America Inc. today 
announces the introduction of Game Boy® Advance SP, a redesigned 
version of the wildly popular Game Boy Advance.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system has  a
new  illumination feature and sleek flip-screen design making  it
the  most  distinctively stylish,  compact and portable Game  Boy
system  ever.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Game Boy Advance SP will become an  instant
"must-have" gadget  when it launches in North America  March  23,
2003,  for an estimated  retail price of $99.95.  It will  launch
in two colors:  cobalt (metallic)  and platinum. </P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Building on
the  significant improvements and refinements already  introduced
in  the current Game Boy Advance,  the new Game Boy Advance    SP
features a revolutionary Front Light Screen making game play  easy
in  any  lighting  condition.</P>

   <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  system  is  powered  by  a
rechargeable    Lithium-Ion battery good for about  10  hours  of
game  play  and takes  only three hours to recharge.   Amazingly,
the  battery  life  increases  to  approximately  18  hours  of
continuous play when the Front Light  Screen is turned off. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  current and future Game Boy Advance games are compatible with
the new system.  And, similarly, Game Boy Advance SP is backward
compatible,   allowing   use   with  virtually  all  games  and
accessories  previously released in the Game Boy line.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Both  Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP reflect  the  best
the   video game market has ever seen in hand-held gaming,"  says
Peter    MacDougall,   executive   vice   president,   sales  and
marketing,  Nintendo  of America Inc.  "For those who  must  have
the  latest in technology  and edgy design,  Game Boy Advance  SP
delivers the ultimate in  portable gaming."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nintendo  will continue to manufacture and market its current,   
successful  Game  Boy Advance system,  which has now  sold-through
more    than 11.5 million units in North America alone since  its
launch a  little more than a year ago. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since its introduction in 1989,  Nintendos portable Game Boy line
has sold more than one-half billion games worldwide,  delivering
a   depth and quality of game play far beyond that offered by any
other    portable  electronics device,  such as Personal  Digital
Assistants  (PDAs) or mobile phones.</P>
