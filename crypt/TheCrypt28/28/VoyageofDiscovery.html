<CENTER>One day back in 16- you know when,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There gathered a small group of men,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To prove the world indeed weren't flat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>They hired a ship, complete with cat.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Provisions they were sought and found,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All went to plan, all safe and sound, </CENTER>
<CENTER>Until they tried to get a crew,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who said "Not likely; not with you!"</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>"But riches could be vast!" we said,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Get lost; I'm going to me bed!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>We then employed a cunning plan,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To obtain each and every man.</CENTER>
<CENTER>A drug for wine and beer we sought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Two gallons of it then we bought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A hurried dash down to the pub,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Before we start, lets get some grub.</CENTER>

<CENTER>A bloke hanging round with a cart, </CENTER>
<CENTER>Charged us two bob to take a part,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"We'll bring you back some good house wine"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"O.K." he said.  That gives us nine!</CENTER>
<CENTER>Three drunken louts gave a helping hand,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And we gave them a brave new land,</CENTER>
<CENTER>About riches, well we were right,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But forgot 'bout injuns out at night.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>We found all sorts of plants about,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then someone gave up such a shout,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"T' Indians smoke these as well,"</CENTER>
<CENTER>A crop of poppys was raised to hell.</CENTER>
<CENTER>We weren't so sure 'bout what to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>'Till someone tried it on the crew,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And every man was each one's brother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As cannabis we did discover.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>No need for rigging any more; </CENTER>
<CENTER>They hover, six feet off the floor!!!!!</CENTER>
<CENTER>"And that is why" a seaman said,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"The need for rigging's nearly dead!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>And as we docked, down at the port</CENTER>,
<CENTER>With folk to witness what we'd bought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A furtiveness used to conceal,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The stuff that made life quite unreal!</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>"We'll show some of this stuff at court,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And tell them where it can be sought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As shipping agents to the masses,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With cash enough for beer and lasses!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>But it didn't go as we'd suppose,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The wards of court turned up their nose,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"And have you anything instead?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Just poppys that are white, not red!"</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>"Of houseplants, Windsor has a few,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Most of them mainly down to you,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And now you dare to bring us more!</CENTER>
<CENTER>So tell us; just what is the score?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"The natives of that land do tell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When dried and smoked, they make you well."</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Do you think it would help my gout?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"There's only one way to find out!"</CENTER>
