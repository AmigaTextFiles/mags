<blockquote>
  <p><font color="AQUA" size="+2">It`s amazing what you learn reading the magazine. 
    I thought Vampires where just a scary story made up from someone who ate to 
    much cheese before going to bed, but reading the article &quot;Living Vampires&quot; 
    makes you wonder if there really could be something in the tales we hear. 
    I`ll leave you to read and make up your own mind about it, but as always we 
    present you with the facts, it`s up to you to whether you believe it or not.</font></p>
  <p><font color="AQUA" size="+2">Do you think your computer is safe to use? There 
    is a flaw in Windows XP (Surprise, surprise). Wouldn`t you think they test 
    these things out before they release them? Talking about releasing software, 
    the Amiga browser IBrowse 2.3 is finally out. What is it like? We tell you. 
    And we don`t forget the many PC users who regularly read the magazine.We bring 
    you reviews of Mozilla, Search and Destroy and others, so there is plenty 
    for everyone no matter what OS you use.</font></p>
  <p><font color="AQUA" size="+2">Once again thanks to the many readers who send 
    in stuff for inclusion, we are over whelmed with all you contributions, but 
    we always have plenty of space for more.</font></p>
  <p><font size="+2"><br>
    <FONT COLOR=AQUA>If an article catches your eye, or there`s something that 
    you disagree with in the </font></font><font color="red" size="+2">Crypt</font><font color="AQUA" size="+2"> 
    then write to us and let us know, we like to hear from you and will reply 
    to all of them. </font></p>
