<P ALIGN="LEFT">For those visiting a steam preservation railway, here are a few tips on keeping safe 
around engines and yards.  It is potentially a very dangerous place, but perfectly 
safe if you always stick closely to a few simple rules and apply a lot of common 
sense.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Applicable to all visitors:- </B></P>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  You must take reasonable care for your own health and safety.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  You must take reasonable care for the health and safety of anyone else who 
may be affected by what you do or not do.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  You must co-operate in all matters of health and safety, and do only what you 
are asked to do by the engine crew or staff.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  As you will now appreciate, a locomotive yard is full of potential dangers by it's 
very nature.  Never increase that danger by leaving things lying about where 
someone might trip over them.  If you see anything lying around which may be a 
hazard, report it to a member of the railway staff.  Fire irons, for instance, live 
either on engines or on the rack provided - they do not live on the floor or the 
ground!</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>5. </B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> The first and most important thing of which you must be aware is that only 
competent, authorised staff may have anything to do with moving any locomotive 
or vehicle.  Only a qualified person may drive a locomotive, act as a fireman/second 
man on a locomotive, couple or uncouple vehicles and give hand signals to a 
driver.  If you have not been examined and passed as competent in any of these 
duties, you must not attempt to carry them out.  When vehicles or engines are 
being moved, keep well clear and remember not to move out of the way of one 
movement into the path of another!
</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>6.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  Never, ever remove a <B>NOT TO BE MOVED</B> sign from a vehicle unless you 
personally put it there and you have ascertained that no one else is relying on it's 
protection.  It may be someone's protection against serious injury or death should 
someone else try to move the vehicle.

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>7.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  It goes without saying that an engine in steam is hot - very hot!  Until you have 
experience to know what is hot and what is not, assume that everything is hot and 
act accordingly.  Remember too, that a pipe that was cold two minutes ago might 
suddenly get hot if steam starts going through it because someone has opened a 
valve somewhere.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>8. </B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> Never interfere with the controls of a locomotive until you are competent to do 
so, you may not necessarily know what is going to happen!</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>9.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  Never open the firedoor in a cab - you might find yourself accompanied on the 
footplate by six foot long flames!</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>10.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  Engines and engine sheds are full of heavy bits and pieces - be they large 
lumps of coal or large lumps of engine.  None of these large lumps will improve 
the shape of your toes or feet if they fall on them, so remember to wear protective 
footwear.  Whatever you are doing, someone else may drop something on your 
toes. If a locomotive is being coaled, it is possible for large lumps of coal to fall 
from a considerable height if the tender is overfilled for instance, or if the aim is 
misjudged.  This happens daily, so never stand in a position where you could be 
struck by coal falling off a tender or bunker.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>11.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  Before a locomotive is moved, the driver should sound the whistle.  If you 
hear a whistle, always assume that an engine is about to move and stand clear 
immediately, keeping well clear of the front of the engine in case the cylinder drain 
cocks are open.  Once an engine's crew have arrived at their engine, do not do 
anything on or around it at all without informing them of what you wish to do.  
Never start to climb up on the back of a tender without telling the crew - they 
might just have checked that they are clear to move back and be totally unaware of 
your presence!  The crew can see very little immediately in front or behind the 
engine, or the top of the boiler, on some engines they cannot see below the 
running plate.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>12.</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  Never walk between two vehicles which are parked on the same line unless 
there is at least 10 feet between them, unless you have made ABSOLUTELY 
CERTAIN that there is no means of moving them.  Over the years many 
experienced railwaymen have been crushed between two vehicles through 
neglecting to take this precaution.  Act safe and walk the long way round.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
