<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Oh, I'm just 29 . again.</I>"</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  a harmless game,  denying our age,  right? We play sensitive
about our age as we get older,  as we get further away from  birth
and  closer  to  death.  It's just a way to share  our  unease  of
growing older with people around us.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try  as we might,  time marches on and we get older just the same.
I  was  reminded about this when I recently read that we  are  now
seven  million years old.  That's at least a million  years  older
than we were just one year ago.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of  course,  that does not mean you or I personally aged a million
years  in the past 365 days.  That would be either a horror  movie
or the work of a genius.  An early human skull found in the Sahara
Desert  is  7  million years old,  pushing  "<B>the  start  of  human
evolution back at least another million years</B>."</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For  you  and me,  age is important.  Denying one's age,  or  even
being sensitive about it,  can be disabling. Our years, our lines,
our  scars  are part of who we are.  They should be  a  matter  of
comfort  and pride.  Happiness eludes us when we feel embarrassed,
guilty, or shy about who we are.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  time  for  each of us to take pride again in  everything  we
are.   Try  saying  something like this:  "<B>I  am  pushing  40 </B> (<I>or
whatever  age  applies to you</I>).  <B>I have lived 40  years.   I  have
survived  40 years.  I have experienced 40 years.  I have  learned
from 40 years. </B> (<I>I have much more to learn,  so God, please let me
live another 40</I>!)  <B>I have thrived,  mostly, during 40 years. And I
am proud of every one of those years.</B>"</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  upon a time,  the elders of the village were revered.   They
bore both knowledge and wisdom.  Now we settle for just knowledge.
The  elders carried traditions down from generations.  Now we just
create brand new "<B>traditions</B>".  The elders were our leaders.   Now
we downsize them.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Youth has its own beauty,  its own advantages,  its own reasons to
be  admired.  So,  too,  does middle age.  In fact,  every age  is
important and every age is beautiful.  How old are you right  now?
(<I>Really,  I don't mean "29 again".</I>)  Whatever age you are,   right
now that is the perfect age -- and the perfect age to be proud of.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oh sure,  it is sort of harmless to kid about one's age.  And many
people joke about it harmlessly.  But many of us also have a  deep
unease  about  our age and our aging -- an unease  that  can  hold
back our self-esteem.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  recall sitting in my pew when it suddenly dawned on me why  one
member  of  the all-female choir looked so different.  Every  lady
was at least 40 years old,  but the other heads were jet black  or
honey  brown or sandy blonde or some other artificial tint.  White
Top Lady packed a loaded bundle of white hair.</P>



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  is  not  a sin to dye one's hair,  as long as we don't  do  it
during  the  service.   It is just  one  of  many  ways  we  adorn
ourselves.   But  the sight of a dozen elderly  ladies  with  hair
colors  impossible for their age made me want to  laugh  out  loud
right there in church.  (<I>I resisted.</I>) All the heads would probably
have  looked  normal  if  White  Top  Lady's  hair  had  not  been
screaming out,  "<B>I'm proud of my color.  I'm proud of my age.  I'm
not going to hide.</B>"</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's  time  to be proud of everything about ourselves,   including
our age. So to everybody reading this, <FONT COLOR=RED><B>"Happy Seven Millionth!"</B></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED>
