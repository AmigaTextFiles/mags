 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Police Officer was waiting along the side of a highway waiting 
to catch speeding drivers. There weren't as many violators this
day as usual. The State Police Officer sees an old car puttering 
along at 22 MPH. He thinks to himself, "This driver is just as dangerous 
as a speeder!"  So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approaching the car, he notices that there are five elderly ladies
-two in the front seat and three in the back-wide eyed and white 
as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, "<I>Officer, I
don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems 
to be the problem?</I>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>Ma'am</B>," the officer replies, "<B>you weren't speeding, but you should 
know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to 
other drivers.</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>Slower than the speed limit</I>? <I>No sir, I was doing the speed limit exactly
...twenty-two miles an hour</I>!" the old woman says a bit proudly.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her 
that "<B>22</B>" was the route number, not the speed limit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for 
pointing out her error. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to ask... is everyone in this 
car OK? These women seem awfully shaken and they haven't muttered 
a single peep this whole time,</B>" the officer asks with concern.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. We just got off Route 215</I>."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An old man gets on a crowded bus and no one gives him a
seat. As the bus shakes and rattles, the old man's cane
slips onto the floor and he falls. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As he gets up, Little Johnny, sitting nearby, turns to him
and says, "<I>If you put a little rubber thingy on the end of
your stick, it wouldn't slip.</I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old man snaps back, "<B>Well, if your dad had done the same
thing seven years ago, I would have a seat today.</B>"</P>

 <CENTER> <B>WRONG ONE</B></CENTER>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just 
  returned from several weeks of intense action on the 
  German front lines. He had finally been granted R&R 
  and was on a train bound for London. The train was very 
  crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, 
  looking for an empty seat. </P>
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well 
  dressed middle-aged lady and was being used by her little 
  dog. The war weary soldier asked, "<B>Please, ma'am, may 
  I sit in that seat?</B>" </P>
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, 
  sniffed and said, "<I>You Americans. You are such a rude 
  class of people. Can't you see my little Fifi is using that 
  seat</I>?" </P>
  
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to 
  rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found 
  himself again facing the woman with the dog. </P>
  
 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Again he asked, "<B>Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very 
  tired.</B>" </P>
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "<I>You 
  Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. 
  Imagine</I>!" </P>
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked 
  up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat 
  down in the empty seat. </P>
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that 
  someone defend her and chastise the soldier.</P> 
  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, 
  "<I><B>You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant 
  for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the 
  wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the 
  road. And now, sir, you've gone and thrown the wrong bitch 
  out the bloody window.</B></I>"</P>
