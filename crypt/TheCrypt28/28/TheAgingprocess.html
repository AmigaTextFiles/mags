<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to get 
old is when we're kids?&nbsp; If you're less than 10 years old, you're so 
excited about aging that you think in fractions. How old are you?.... 
"<B>I'm four and a half</B>" .... You're never 36 and a half .... you're 
four and a half going on five! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's the key. You get into your teens, now they can't hold you back. 
You jump to the next number. How old are you? "<B>I'm gonna be 16.</B>" You 
could be 12, but you're gonna be 16. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then the greatest day of your life happens .... you become 21. 
Even the words sound like a ceremony .... you <B>BECOME 21 ... YES!!!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But then you turn 30 .... ooohhh what happened there? Makes you sound 
like bad milk .... He <B>TURNED</B>, we had to throw him out. There's no fun 
now. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What's wrong?? What changed?? You <B>BECOME 21</B>, you <B>TURN 30</B>, then you're 
<B>PUSHING 40</B> ..... stay over there, it's all slipping away ........ </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You <B>BECOME 21</B>, you <B>TURN 30</B>, you're <B>PUSHING 40</B>, you <B>REACH 50</B> ..... 
and your dreams are gone. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then you <B>MAKE IT to 60</B> ..... you didn't think you'd make it!!!! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So you <B>BECOME 21</B>, you <B>TURN 30</B>, you're <B>PUSHING 40</B>, you <B>REACH 50</B>, you 
<B>MAKE IT to 60</B> ...... then you build up so much speed you <B>HIT 70!</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After that, it's a day by day thing. After that, you <B>HIT</B> Wednesday .... 
You get into your 80's, you <B>HIT</B> lunch. My grandmother won't even buy 
green bananas .... it's an investment you know, and maybe a bad one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And it doesn't end there .... into the 90's you start going backwards 
.... I was <B>JUST 92 </B>... </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then a strange thing happens. If you make it over 100, you become a 
little kid again .... "I<B>'m 100 and a half!!!!</B>" </P>
