<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dell  Computer  will  begin phasing out  the  floppy  drive  as  a
standard feature on selected Dimension desktops,  beginning at the
end of this month.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beginning  with the Dimension 8250,  a high-end PC  using  Intel's
3.06-GHz  Pentium  4  processors,  Dell will offer  customers  the
option of using a USB memory key instead.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dell  tipped its plans last year,  when the company began offering
its  own  branded 16-Mbyte and 64-Mbyte USB keys for use with  its
Inspiron  notebook  line.    Dell   then  began  phasing  out  the
Inspiron's  floppy,  replacing them with a branded  Dell  USB  key
that  maintains the "look and feel" of Dell products.  Over  time,
Dell  expects  to phase out the floppy on other Dimension  desktop
models as well, Dell officials said.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>The  floppy  drive's   popularity   is   declining</I>,"  said  David
Schwarzbach,  a Dimension product marketing manager.   "<I>There's  a
percentage  of  our user base that can't remember  the  last  time
they've used them.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schwarzbach  said  the  USB  drives  "act  just  like  a  floppy",
including the ability to drag and drop files,  but not the ability
to boot from them.  IBM's memory keys,  by contrast, are bootable.
Recovery  "disks"  under  Microsoft's   latest  Windows  operating
systems, however, have tended to be CDs.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>There's  not  a  set  standard on a USB boot  protocol</I>,"  a  Dell
spokesman said. "<I>When there is one, we'll support it.</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  a  consumer  orders a Dimension 8250,  he  or  she  will  be
presented with three options,  according to Shannon Baxley, a Dell
product  marketing manager:  to exclude a floppy,   to  include  a
floppy, or choose either of the USB memory keys.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dell hopes to keep the price of a desktop floppy option and a  USB
memory key relatively comparable,  Schwarzbach said.  Currently, a
Dell modular floppy drive for the Inspiron notebook PC costs  $30,
while a 16-Mbyte memory key costs $20 and a 64-Mbyte key $59.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  customers  tend  to  prefer the higher-capacity  64-Mbyte  USB
keys,  Dell will consider moving to higher-capacity models in  the
future, Schwarzbach said.</P>
