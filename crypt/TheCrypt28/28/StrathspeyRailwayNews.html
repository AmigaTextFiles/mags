<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  Strathspey  Railway's   plans   to  extend  their  line  from
Broomhill  to  Grantown on Spey were approved by    the  planning
committee of Highland Council at their meeting on 27th January.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broomhill,   the present terminus of the line from Aviemore,   was
opened  by  the  railway only last year and is  approximately  3½
miles  from  the site of the former West Station in Grantown.   On
leaving Broomhill the route of the line lies,  initially,  on  the
valley  floor of the Spey,  crosses the River Dulnain and  shortly
after  begins the climb,  eventually at 1:  80,  towards Grantown.
Three  major  civil engineering obstacles have to be  overcome  in
completing the rebuild of the line.  Firstly,  the bridge span has
to  be  replaced over the Dulnain,  secondly the  A95  Trunk  Road
crossing  followed  immediately by restoration  of  a  section  of
embankment  that was removed when the road was first realigned  in
the seventies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crossing  the  A95  was  thought to be  the  obstacle  that  might
scupper  the  entire project but plans now prepared  for  the  new
realignment of the road have made provision for a short tunnel  to
allow the line to gain the original formation. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">News  that  the Council had approved the plans for the  rebuilding
of  the  line  and provision of the new station have  been  warmly
welcomed  by  members of the Railway's Board of Directors  and  by
the  lines  many supporters.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Company Chairman,  Doug Scott said, <B>"It's a great step forward and
evidence  of  the  enthusiasm  of the  Grantown  Community    and
Highland  Councils  for the railway's redevelopment."</B>  Ron  Black,
the  railway's Marketing Director said,  <B>"The approval means  that
we  can  now  begin,   with confidence,  the process  of  detailed
planning and costing of the project."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reopening of the route will not come cheap.  While details of what
this  will be can now be obtained the cost involved in getting  to
Broomhill,  £460,000 in round figures,  is something of  a  guide.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However,  this part of the route was relatively uncomplicated  and
did  not  require any of the major civil engineering  work  to  be
undertaken on the last lap to Grantown.  Sourcing of  funds  and
materials  for  the  project  will take  some  time  to  complete,
although  the  railway  already has  a  considerable  quantity  of
sleepers in stock,  so evidence on the ground will not be  visible
in the immediate future.</P>
