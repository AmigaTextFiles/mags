<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the MV5, Canon has utilised digital camera technology and know-how to improve still image reproduction. Colour signal processing has been corrected on the premise that image recorded on tape will be viewed on a TV monitor and that images recorded on the memory card will be printed out or viewed on a PC. By making separate signal processing possible for both movies and still images the parameters for image quality adjustments have been substantially extended.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the conventional digital effects, the MV5 offers a variety of digital effects such as those available with PC editing. Now users have more opportunity to show their creativity with the 9 new digital effects (flip, tide, puzzle, etc.) as well as a range of colour tones from sepia to black and white and multi image screen.
As all (DV, AV, LANC, USB, MIC, DC and S video) terminals are located on the camera body, the new MV5 has no need for a docking unit as with previous models.
