<P ALIGN="LEFT">More  myth  than fact.  Vampire bats do feed on blood,   but  they
won't attack a human and suck blood from the neck.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Myths  and legends from all over the world portray bats as  blood-
sucking  demons.  Vampire bats really do exist,   but  only  three
species in Central and South America.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  vampire  bats (<I>Desmodus rotundus</I>)  have a wingspan  of  about
eight  inches and a body about the size of an adult's  thumb.   If
not  for their diet,  people would not pay much attention to these
small  bats.   Vampire  bats feed on the  blood  of  large  birds,
cattle,  horses,  and pigs.  However, they don't suck the blood of
their "victims".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using their sharp teeth,  the bats make tiny cuts in the skin of a
sleeping animal.  The bats' saliva contains a chemical that  keeps
the  blood  from clotting.  The bats then lap up  the  blood  that
oozes from the wound.  Another chemical in their saliva numbs  the
animal's skin and keeps them from waking up.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A vampire bat finds its prey with echolocation,  smell, and sound.
They  fly about one meter above the ground.  Then they use special
heat  sensors in their noses to find veins that are close  to  the
skin.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scientists have discovered that vampire bat saliva  is  better  at
keeping blood from clotting than any known medicine.  Vampire bats
may  one day help prevent heart attacks and strokes.  Vampire bats
are  one  of the few bat species that are considered a  pest.   In
Latin America,  cattle raising is a growing business, and sleeping
cattle attract vampire bats.  In ranching areas,  control programs
have  been  started.  However,  millions of  beneficial  bats  are
destroyed by people who mistake them for vampires.</P>
