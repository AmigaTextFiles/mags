For those of you who prefer still images to the moving kind, weve also added even more hi-res screenshots of the game in action, almost 30 of them,
in fact.  Give em a gander at:<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you rushed off to download the trailer as soon as you read about it, then youve already heard a sample of the next surprise I have for you all -
Samples of the Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown soundtrack!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Cinemaware games are know for their great presentation and unique mix of genres, who can forget the classic music that goes along with them?  We
knew we needed to get something special to live up to DotCs musical legacy, so we searched and searched to find a composer who was up to the task.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We finally found the man for the job in Troels Folmann of Deffmute.  Troels did an amazing job by busting out over 45 minutes of fantastic music that
really captures the spirit of high adventure and drama of Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown.  Deffmute recently updated their homepage with a ton of
samples of the music: http://www.deffmute.com/diary/diary.html Give it a listen!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Troels has also been kind enough to do a few interviews with the press about the experience of working with Cinemaware and composing music for Robin
Hood.  Check out his interview with The Electric Playground at: <A HREF="http://www.elecplay.com/interview.html?article=10564">http://www.elecplay.com/interview.html?article=10564 </A> and another with Gamescore:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, the game has made its way out of our offices and into the eager hands of the press all over the world.  The feedback so far has been GREAT,
and were sure youll be more excited than ever when you start reading the previews.</P>
