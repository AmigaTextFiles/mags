  <p>I thought I would try yet another browser, just to see what I was missing. 
  </p>
<p>The browser this time…………. Mozilla.</p>
<p> <img width=390 height=262
src="Images/mozilla02.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"> </p>
<p> <img width=1028 height=798
src="Images/mozilla04.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
<p>You tend to hear this browser mentioned quite frequently on the net, so I wondered 
  if it lived up to the hype.</p>
<p>The version I downloaded was version 1.1 . There are newer versions, but when 
  I went to the Mozilla site  ( <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">http://www.mozilla.org</a> 
  ), this was the one that was considered the most stable.</p>
<p>Not actively wishing to be a beta tester for it, I thought I’d use this and 
  then decide if I wanted to upgrade to a newer version.</p>
<p>            The download isn’t that bad, and shouldn’t take you too long  . 
  Installation is straight forward and a few minutes later, you can be using Mozilla.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=744 height=581
src="Images/mozilla06.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>As you can see, the browser displays as well as any other. It does suffer from 
  the problem that all alternatives to Internet Explorer do……more and more sites 
  are written specifically for I.E. …………..</p>
<p>However, it very seldom falls over.</p>
<p>Considering its closeness to Netscape, I was prepared to hate this browser, 
  but over the weeks I have found myself using it more and more.</p>
<p>It is easy to use, while not the fastest at displaying (will anything ever 
  beat Opera for raw speed?), it isn’t particularly sluggish either.</p>
<p>The display is usually good and formatting is preserved nicely.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=556 height=684
src="Images/mozilla08.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p>It has lots of things to recommend it.</p>
<p>As you can see, it has a cookie manger. This is a very handy tool , if you 
  desire to get rid of a specific cookie, or are just plain nosey to see what 
  you’ve actually picked up on your travels.</p>
<p>This is something that I think should be used in all browsers and made as easy!</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=1159 height=402
src="Images/mozilla10.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Of course, it also has a download manager. The download manger works well………..though 
  not as well as Opera’s. For instance, when I downloaded the Open Office archive 
  ( which was quite large, by narrowband standards), this failed to restart after 
  after I had redialled, whereas Opera’s did. </p>
<p>However, it is still useful, although don’t rely on it to resume <span>J</span></p>
<p> <img border=0 width=504 height=418
src="Images/mozilla12.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>It has a form manager as well. Another useful little tool , which allows you 
  to save and retrieve forms that you have come across.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=516 height=459
src="Images/mozilla14.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
<p>I haven’t mentioned the Java console either, although this is more for techies.</p>
<p>The browser comes with Java as standard, so you don’t require to download anything 
  extra.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=924 height=816
src="Images/mozilla16.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
<p>Take a look at the Window menu shown, lets  have a very quick glance at the 
  ones listed.</p>
<p>As with Opera, it comes with its own mail client and newsgroup reader.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=660 height=444
src="Images/mozilla18.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>IRC chat (alias Chatzilla)</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=554 height=432
src="Images/mozilla20.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
<p>Since I don’t use IRC in any form, I couldn’t tell you if this is any good, 
  but I’d expect it to be up to the standard of the rest……which means it will 
  work …..and probably well.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=674 height=505
src="Images/mozilla22.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>You even get composer, which can write some HTML for you and, of couse , check 
  the validation of it.</p>
<p>Not bad for a free browser, is it.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=948 height=864
src="Images/mozilla24.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
<p>I suppose I should give you a peek at the password manager……….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=553 height=421
src="Images/mozilla26.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
<p>I’ve left the Warblade one in, just to show I do have one <span>J</span></p>
<p>Be very careful of this, remember that if your browser is storing passwords 
  for you, anyone else using the computer could get access to them!</p>
<p>This is where I should tell you that you can set profiles in Mozilla.</p>
<p>As I said, anyone using the browser could use the password manager, so if there’s 
  that chance, you should really set up your own profile. This will set your email 
  address, address book etc and prevent anyone else accessing it.</p>
<p>Another very useful part to Mozilla.</p>
<p>Another handy little tool is the image manager……..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=283 height=381
src="Images/mozilla28.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037">  </p>
<p>You can use this to manage images or decide which sites you don’t want to load 
  images from automatically. Something that could speed up your browsing considerably.</p>
<p>From all the grabs, you might think I was impressed by Mozilla……..and I am.</p>
<p>It is a relatively fast browser. It has loads of nice touches. It isn’t a finished 
  product by any manner of means, but it does have enough for you to want to use 
  it and keep on your drive. It is constantly being updated and improved………..and 
  it isn’t Microsoft’s, so it does have quite a few things in its favour.</p>
<p>I haven’t even touched on the extensive help file for the browser which will 
  tell you how to set the browser up, how to use the tabbed windows , email, composer 
  and the like, but its all there. If that fails you, you can go straight to the 
  Mozilla site and search there for an answer to a question as well as download 
  the latest version.</p>
<p>Anyone who has used a browser before will get to grips with this quickly and 
  customising the sidebar and look and feel of the browser is easy and painless.</p>
<p>It won’t really let you down badly and if you want a browser with all the addons 
  as can be seen above, you’d better try it out!</p>
