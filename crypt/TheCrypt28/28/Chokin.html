<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who has been 
eating a sandwich, begins to cough.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">After a minute or 
so it becomes apparent that she is in real distress, 
and the cowboys turn to look at her.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Kin ya 
swaller?"</B> asks one of the cowboys.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>No</I>", signals the 
woman, desperately shaking her head.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Kin ya 
breathe?"</B> asks the other.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The woman, beginning to turn 
a bit blue, shakes her head "<I>No</I>" again.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The first cowboy walks over to her, lifts her 
skirt and slowly runs his tongue up and down her left 
butt cheek.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, 
the obstruction flies out of her mouth and she begins 
to breathe again.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The cowboy walks back to the bar and proudly 
takes a sip of his beer.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His partner says in 
admiration.... <B>"Ya know, I'd heard of that there 
Hind Lick Maneuver, but I ain't never seed nobody do 
it "</B></P>
