<FONT COLOR=AQUA> <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> Even though it is indicated throughout the novel that he is to be destroyed with a wooden stake, this is not how it happens. In the final scene, Harker and Morris dispatch the Count with knives.</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>



 <FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.<FONT COLOR=SILVER> There is nothing in Stoker's novel to indicate that the vampire can be destroyed by sunlight. Count Dracula moves about freely in the daytime, though with a reduction in his supernatural powers. (The "sunlight" motif entered the legend as a result of the 1922 film "Nosferatu".)</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
