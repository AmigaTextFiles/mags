 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This week, our phones went dead and I had to contact the Telstra
 repair people. They promised to be out between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00p.m.
 When I asked if they could give me a smaller time window, the pleasant
 gentleman asked, "Would you like us to call you before we come?" I
 replied that I didn't see how he would be able to do that since our
 phones weren't working. He also requested that we report future
 outages by email. (<B>Does YOUR email work without a telephone line?</B>).</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the
 clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card.
 She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the
 card was signed. When I asked why, she explained that it was necessary
 to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt. So I signed
 the credit card in front of her. She carefully compared the signature
 to the one I had just signed on the receipt. As luck would have it,
 they matched.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I live in a semi-rural area. We recently had a new neighbour call
 the local township administrative office to request the removal of the
 Koala Crossing sign on our road. The reason: too many Koala's were
 being hit by cars and she didn't want them to cross there anymore.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport
 employee asked, "Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your
 knowledge?" To which I replied, "If it was without my knowledge,
 how would I know?" She smiled knowingly and nodded, "That's why we ask."</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it's safe to cross the
 street. I was crossing with a co-worker of mine when she asked if I knew
 what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when
 the light is red. Appalled, she responded, "What on earth are blind
 people doing driving?"</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear co-worker who is leaving
 the company due to "downsizing," our manager commented cheerfully,
 "This is fun. We should do this more often". Not a word was spoken. We
 all just looked at each other with that cow-in-the-headlights stare.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When my wife and I arrived at a car dealership to pick up our
 car, we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service
 department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the
 driver's side door. As I watched from the passenger side, I
 instinctively tried the door handle and discovered that it was
 unlocked. "Hey," I announced to the technician, "it's open!" To
 which he replied, "I know - I already got that side."</P>
