><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>The guy who wrote this is a genius.  The letter to a bank below is
an  actual letter sent to a bank in the United States.   the  bank
manager thought it amusing enough to have it published in the  New
York Times.</I> </P></FONT>
<FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Dear Sir:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  am  writing  to thank you for <B>bouncing</B> my check  with  which  I
endeavoured to pay my plumber last month.  By my calculations some
three  nanoseconds must have elapsed between  his  presenting  the
check  and the arrival in my account of the funds eeded to  honour
it.  I refer,  of course,  to the automatic monthly deposit of  my
entire salary,  an arrangement which,  I admit,  has only been  in
place for <B>eight</B> years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  are  to  be  <B>commended</B>  for  seizing  that  brief  window  of
opportunity,  and also for debiting my account by $50  by  way  of
penalty  for  the  inconvenience   I  caused  to  your  bank.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has
caused me to rethink my <B>errant</B> financial ways.  You have set me on
the  path  of <B>fiscal righteousness</B>.  No more will our relationship
be blighted by these unpleasant incidents,  for I am restructuring
my affairs in 2002,  taking as my model the procedures,  attitudes
and conduct of your very <B>bank</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  can  think  of  no greater compliment and I know  you  will  be
excited and proud to hear it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  this end,  please be advised of the following changes  I  have
noticed  that whereas I personally attend to your telephone  calls
and  letters,  when I try to contact you,  I am confronted by  the
impersonal,  ever-changing,  pre-recorded,  faceless entity  which
your  bank has become.  From now on I,  like you,  choose only  to
deal with a flesh-and-blood person.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My mortgage and loan repayments will,  therefore and hereafter, no
longer  be  automatic,  but will arrive at your bank,   by  check,
addressed  personally and confidentially to an  employee  at  your
branch whom you must nominate.  You will be aware that  it  is  an
offence under the Postal Act for any other person to open such  an
envelope.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please find attached an Application Contact Status which I require
your  chosen  employee to complete.  I am sorry it runs  to  eight
pages,  but in order that I know as much about him or her as  your
bank knows about me, there is no alternative.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please note that all copies of his or her medical history must  be
countersigned  by a Notary Public,  and the mandatory  details  of
his/her  financial   situation   (<B>income,    debts,    assets  and
liabilities</B>)   must be accompanied by documented  proof.   In  due
course  I will issue your employee with a <B>PIN</B> number which  he/she
must quote in dealings with me.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but,  again,  I
have  modelled  it  on  the number of button presses  required  to
access  my  account balance on your phone bank service.   As  they
say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Let me level the
playing  field even further by introducing you to my new telephone
system, which you will notice, is very much like yours.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My  Authorized Contact at your bank,  the only person with whom  I
will  have  any  dealings,  may call me at any time  and  will  be
answered by an automated voice service: <B>Press buttons as follows:</B></P>

<B>1.</B> To make an appointment to see me. <BR>
<B>2.</B> To query a missing payment. <BR>
<B>3.</B> To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there. <BR>
<B>4.</B> To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping. <BR>
<B>5. </B>To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature. <BR>
<B>6. </B>To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home.<BR> 
<B>7.</B> To leave a message on my computer, a password to access my computer 
is required.   Password will be communicated  at a later date to the 
Authorized Contact. <BR>
<B>8. </B>To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through 7. <BR>
<B>9. </B>To make a general complaint or inquiry. The contact  will then 
be put on hold,  pending the attention of my  automated answering service. <BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While this may on occasion involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music
will play for the duration of the call.  This month I've chosen  a
refrain  from "The Best of Woodie Guthrie":  "Oh,  the  banks  are
made  of marble,  With a guard at every door,  And the vaults  are
filled with silver, That the miners sweated for."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On  a  more serious note,  we come to the matter of cost.  As your
bank  has  often  pointed  out,  the  ongoing  drive  for  greater
efficiency  comes at a cost which you have always  been  quick  to
pass on to me.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let  me  repay  your kindness by passing some costs back.   First,
there  is  a matter of advertising material you send me.   This  I
will  read  for  a  fee  of  $20  per page.   Inquiries  from  the
Authorized  Contact will be billed at $5 per  minute  of  my  time
spent in response.  Any debits to my account,  as, for example, in
the  matter  of  the penalty for the dishonoured check,   will  be
passed  back to you.  New phone service runs at 75 cents a minute.
You  will be well advised to keep your inquiries brief and to  the
point.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an 
establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">May I wish you a happy, if ever-so-slightly less prosperous, New 
Year? </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Your Humble Client, </P>
