<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An  elderly woman bought a parrot.  The woman asked  if  it  would
behave  if  she took it to church with her on Sundays.  The  store
owner  said it shouldn't be a problem and that she could  put  him
on her shoulder and he would stay there.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She  bought  the  parrot and the next week  she  put  him  on  her
shoulder  and went off to church.  Just as everyone  quieted  down
and  the sermon began,  the parrot looked around,  squawked,   and
said, <B>"It's goddamned cold in here!"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Everyone  turned to look at her,  she ran out  of  the  church  in
total embarrassment!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  next  day  she  returned to the pet store and  explained  the
embarrassing situation to the owner.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  store  owner offered the following solution:  <B>"If the  parrot
does that again,  grab him by the legs and swing him around 5 or 6
times and return him to your shoulder."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So,   the  next  Sunday she took the parrot to church  and,   sure
enough,   just  as the sermon started the parrot squawked,   <B>"It's
goddamned cold in here!!"</B>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without  any hesitation,  the woman grabbed his legs,   swung  him
around 5 or 6 times and placed him back on her shoulder.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  parrot  shook  his feathers back in place  and  said  "<B>Pretty
fucking windy as well!"</B></P>
