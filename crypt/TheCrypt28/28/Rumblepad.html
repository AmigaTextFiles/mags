<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because  top  gamers  need to immerse themselves  totally  in  the
action,   Logitech  engineers have created the Logitech  Cordless
Rumblepad,  designed to help you keep your mind 100  per  cent  on
the game.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  sophisticated,   free-ranging  pad  uses  2.4  GHz  cordless
technology  to keep you on top of the action up  to  a  full  five
metres from the receiver.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two  robust motors in the base,  operating independently  of  each
other,   respond  instantly and realistically  to  everything  the
creative  minds  of  the  original games makers  intended  you  to
experience  - adding dramatically to the totality of  the  playing
experience.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  your  mind  100 per cent on the game and Logitech  Cordless
Rumblepad  'alive and kicking' in your hands - here lies  the  way
to true invincibility.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4  GHz  cordless  technology   for  more  reliability  and  less
interferences  Powerful vibration feedback  from  two  independent
motors  let you feel every explosion,  collision,  and recoil  Get
all the control you need:  dual analog mini-sticks,  eight-way  D-
pad, 11 programmable buttons, and a slide throttle</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
