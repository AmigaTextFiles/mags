<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My family went on a mini vacation a few years back which included a stay at a 
very nice hotel. During our stay, I admired how clean the room was and wished 
my home could be that clean. We had a long drive home and I thought about how 
I could start keeping my home that clean or close to it. The reason my house 
wasn't as clean as I liked was because I didn't do everything that needed to 
be done when it needed to be done'in other words, I didn't have a system. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What I came up with was a chore schedule list. I started out by writing down 
every chore that needs to be done for each room in the house, then I labeled 
them with either a <B>D</B> (for daily), a <B>W</B> (for weekly), an <B>M</B> (for monthly) or <B>1-3 
x a year</B>. Then I went to the computer and opened up 4 new documents and saved 
them as Daily, Weekly, Monthly and 1-3 x a year. On each of these documents I 
listed each chore that needs to be completed in that time frame and left an 
area for checking off each chore on each day, week or month when completed. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a while since I created these chore schedules and since then, I'
ve come up with an excellent way to get my family to help.  Here's what I 
did:  I made the chores schedules into tables with spaces to write in whoever'
s initials completes the chore.  At the end of the week, we tally up initials 
and we come up with <B>1st</B>, <B>2nd</B>, <B>3rd</B> and <B>4th</B> place winners (4 people in my 
family).  First place is the one who has the most initials and so on.  We 
give $10 to 1st place, $7.00 to 2nd, $5.00 to 3rd and a giant candy bar to 
4th.  To even be considered for a prize, a family member must have at least 7 
chores completed. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This method has members of my family racing to get as many chores done as 
possible within a week trying to win 1st place!  The house has been much 
cleaner and my kids are learning housecleaning skills while having fun trying 
to win.  Of course it has been much less work for me so it is well worth the 
money paid for prizes.  If you don't agree with paying money for chores, then 
you could give other types of prizes such as time spent with mom or a day at 
the park, etc.</P>
