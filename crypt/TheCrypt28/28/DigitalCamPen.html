<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  trouble  with many of the very small digital cameras  on  the
market  at  the  moment  is that they don't  look  very  smart  or
sophisticated.  With its brushed steel casing,   this  Pen  Camera
won't look out of place in the pocket of a business suit.  Indeed,
it's a high-quality writing instrument in its own right.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One  reason why so many so-called "pen cameras" don't  look  quite
right is that they have to incorporate a visual display.  This one
gets  round  that  problem  by  using  audio  rather  than  visual
instructions.   Yes,  it talks to you.  with a  slightly  Oriental
accent!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like almost all digital cameras,  you download pictures onto a PC.
The Pen Camera is different from many others,  however, in that it
uses  the  RS232 COM port,  which is present on just  about  every
computer rather than the USB port which is not quite as common.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  connected to a PC the Pen Camera operates as a sophisticated
Web  Cam so you can use it to send live pictures to friends across
the  Internet.  As a stills camera it will store up to 36 pictures
in its 2MB of built-in memory.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other  vital  statistics are that it weighs just over  two  ounces
including  batteries.  Power comes from  two  AG13  "hearing  aid"
batteries,   which are good for at least 500 shots.   Replacements
are easy to find, and fairly inexpensive.</P>
