<P ALIGN="LEFT">There  was  once a sheep farmer who needed help with the difficult
task  of  castrating some of his inferior male sheep to keep  them
from  breeding with the females.  He hired a French guy who didn't
speak English, but was a very good worker.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After the first day,  they had successfully castrated 14 sheep and
his  French worker was just about to throw away the 'spare parts',
but the sheep farmer yelled,  "<B>No! Don't throw those away! My wife
fries them up and we eat them.  They're delicious and we call them
'sheep fries'.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Later  that  day,  the French hired hand came in  for  supper  and
indeed, the 'sheep fries' were tasty.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The next day,  they castrated 16 sheep,  and the next evening they
all  settled down to another supper of 'sheep fries'.   The  third
day,  however,  when the sheep farmer came home, he asked his wife
where the French hired hand was.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She said,  "You know,  it was the weirdest thing! I told him since
there weren't very many 'sheep fries' this evening,  we were  also
going to have French fries. <B>Then he screamed and ran like hell.</B>"</P>
