 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The very first appearance of "Count Dracula" is in Bram Stoker's novel
DRACULA (1897).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But Stoker did not make up the name "Dracula".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a Dracula in the 15th century:  Vlad the Impaler. Stoker
didn't know much about him (at least I don't think he did)  but he
came  across  his  name in a book he was researching  entitled  AN
ACCOUNT  OF  THE PRINCIPALITIES OF WALLACHIA AND MOLDAVIA  (1820).
This  book  has  a very short section on a "Voivode  Dracula"  who
fought against the Turks.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  attracted  Stoker to the name "Dracula" was  a  footnote  by
Wilkinson  which  stated that "Dracula in the Wallachian  language
means devil".  Not quite accurate, but that is what Stoker saw and
copied into his notes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> He was originally  going to call his vampire "Count Wampyr"  but  changed
it to "Count  Dracula."  This change is clearly  made  in  Stoker's  own
notes for DRACULA which are located at the Rosenbach Museum in Philadelphia.</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  real  Dracula (about whom we know much more than Stoker  ever
did)   was  NOT a Count,  nor was he a vampire (or ever associated
with vampires).  The two Draculas have become greatly confused  in
many people's minds.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my contention that Stoker was not,  as many think,  inspired
by accounts  of  Vlad  the Impaler to create the character  of  Count
Dracula. There  is  no  evidence for that view.  </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Count Dracula,  of course, was not the first vampire. Vampires had
existed  in  folklore and legend for hundreds of years,   back  to
ancient times.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stoker  came  across  some information about  vampire  beliefs  in
Transylvania  which he used in the novel.  He  was  also  familiar
with  earlier  vampire literature written in  English  during  the
19th century.</P>
