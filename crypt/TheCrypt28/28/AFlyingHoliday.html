<CENTER>The winter passed, it's time to seek vacations in the sun,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Within the Travel Bureaux the hunt has now begun.</CENTER>
<CENTER>To find a most convenient spot, convivial to all,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Teenage kids vote 18 / 30; yeah, we'll have a ball.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Mauritius seems a nice place, for all of us to go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But then the kids scupper the plan by loudly saying "No!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Well how is Amsterdam?", I say; "If only for the week?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>The missus sets a stony look, and gives my ear a tweak.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>Belgium, Brussels, and gay Paris all get the elbow too,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Jamaica, Turin and Egypt - there's not a lot to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We have exhausted brochures, from here and there worldwide,</CENTER>
<CENTER>So with foreboding and dismay, we let t'agent decide.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>And on the bus on our way home, there's a tremendous din,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The missus giving it "Why did you leave it up to him?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"We were there for three hours, and still hadn't got a clue,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And he's the piggin' expert, to make our dreams come true!"</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>A telephone call later, late the following week,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The agent says "I've found one, that's totally unique,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The most totally different holiday, that you've ever had,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I've booked you for two months in .......<B>THE CENTRE OF BAGDAD!!!!</B>"</CENTER>
