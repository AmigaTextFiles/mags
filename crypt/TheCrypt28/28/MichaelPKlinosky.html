<P ALIGN="LEFT">Btw  -  you  can  call  me Mike,  and the P.   is  for  Pius  (I'm
Lithuanian; that was my maternal Grandfather's name.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was born in Bethlehem,  PA on 2 Jun 64,  and grew up in Reading,
PA.   From the time I was 10 or so,  I tinkered with all sorts  of
mechanical   devices,    and   electricity   drew   my  curiosity.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electronics was the next logical step,  then came computers. Fresh
out of Governor Mifflin High School,  I tried for a BS in Computer
Science  at  PennState/Berks,  but spent  too  much  time  in  the
computer lab.  So,  I took a break for a year, then served 6 years
in  the  US  Navy  as  an Electronic Technician (and  received  an
Honorable  discharge as an E5).</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a forgone conclusion  that
I'd  get  a  Bachelor's  degree,  and I was always  interested  in
scientific  concepts.  So,  during my last year in  the  Navy,   I
decided  to  immediately re-enroll at PennState  for  Physics.   I
graduated in May '97 (from Behrend,  the Erie campus). For about a
year,  I volunteered for Habitat for Humanity.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For almost 2 years,
I  was  an  electronic technician for a small company that  worked
with  local  industries.  I then enrolled at Penn State's  nanofab
for the Spring semester of 2001,  where I got experience with thin
films (e.g.  semiconductors). We used a class 10/100 cleanroom and
various  equipment to create and characterize  structures  at  the
micrometer scale.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> My main interests involve science:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>*</B>  physics (of course!),  astronomy,  geology,  and geophysics<BR>
<B>*</B> technology:  'high tech'  components  or  end products<BR>
<B>*</B> mechanics:   how  things  work<BR>
<B>*</B> computers: using and programming<BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beside these,  I have a few hobbies.  I recently began researching
my  genealogy (most of my Grandparents came from Lithuania in  the
early  20th century).  I still dabble in electronics.   Doing  any
kind of car or house maintenance interests me.  Finally, I collect
succulents (I have about 80),  and have a few investments. Most of
my  knowledge comes from being self-taught:  I talked  to  people,
read  books and magazines,  experimented,  and watched educational
tv.   I  am  a  charter-subscriber to Discover (I  even  keep  the
issues).   My favorite TV channels are The Learning Channel,   The
Discovery  Channel,   and  The  History  Channel.   My  spare-time
activities include working on a few tech/sci projects and  setting
up this site.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one sense,  the Internet is a way to make an idea available  to
the world.  Similar concepts have existed for a while (e.g. books,
newspapers,   television),  but the Internet puts  an  interesting
spin on things.  As you might surmise,  I have something to say  -
and  I  think  it  will  be very interesting!   As  noted  at  the
entrance,  this site could change daily.  I intend to add  several
sub-pages (most will pertain to life and society).  I also  intend
to promote it (such as on search engines).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  have a few intentions with the design of this site.  Of course,
one  is  to  give  a  surfer  a  glimpse  of  my  personality  and
lifestyle.  Another,  and probably more important,  is to  mention
social  issues.  To that end,  I've commenced writing my  'society
pages'.</P>
