<P ALIGN="LEFT">When I first learned about horses, all I knew about them was
the flies, the smell, and the sore rear-end after spending
time in the saddle.  My wife has always been interested in
them (<I>as the line in the movie goes, "What's the deal with
chicks and horses</I>??") so I thought I'd at least give it a
try.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm glad I did.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I first got acquainted with them at a ranch not far from our
home.  On one of my first rides we were with Joyce, the
owner of the ranch, and we could hear an off-road motorcycle
in the distance.  My horse started to get nervous and was
prancing around, which made <B>ME</B> pretty nervous because I had
no idea what I was doing and the last thing I wanted to do
was get off the horse <B>"unintentionally"</B>, if you know what I
mean.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As the motorcycle got closer and the horse got more nervous,
I thought it would be best to turn the horse away from the
sound so he wouldn't be frightened when it came into view.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>WRONG.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Joyce yelled out, "<I>Turn the horse TOWARD the noise.  Face
the danger; when he sees what it is he'll be okay.</I>"  I did,
and he was.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Face the danger."</B>  Think about that; there are some words
for all of us to live by.  When there is something we are
afraid of it is critical that we face it head on; trying to
ignore it will only make things worse.  No matter how
frightening it may seem at the time, the more you know about
a problem the easier it is to deal with.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Let's say you're worried about your cash flow.  (<I>If you're
in business for yourself, you probably <B>ARE</B> worried about
cash flow</I>!)  The more you think about it and all of its
ramifications, the scarier it seems.  "<I>All of these bills to
pay I've got to get these invoices out when will they pay
me I have to wait for their checks to clear maybe I can
get one of my vendors to give me a little more time</I> " and
on, and on.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's way too easy to say to yourself, "<I>I'll deal with this
tomorrow</I>" but then you have a gut-wrenching day worrying
about it.  Don't do that to yourself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Face the danger.  Make a cash flow spreadsheet.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>BINGO!</B>  You now have a cash flow, and you can see which
months you will be short, and by how much.  It's a funny
thing; no matter how bad the news is it isn't as scary when
you can look at it in black and white.  And, the more
detailed you make the cash flow the less scary it gets.  You
can download a free sample cash flow worksheet <B>(Microsoft
Excel format)</B> at<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Face the danger.  It works for the horse; it will work for
you too.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Regarding those other things:  the flies can be controlled,
the smell is actually quite pleasant when you begin to enjoy
the horses, and the sore rear-end isn't so sore after you've
done it a few times.  Hmmm... there are a few more lessons
right there...</P>
