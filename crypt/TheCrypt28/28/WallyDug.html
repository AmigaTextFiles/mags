<P ALIGN="LEFT">Disciples of Wally Dug can access his full, unadulterous biography, printed within these hallowed pages for the very first time.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is also the chance to read all of the award-winning, earth-shattering articles that appeared in <B>JAM magazine</B>, plus some that were never published due to the astounding nature of them.</P>



<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can even email the great man himself and quickly get that solution that you have been unable to work out for yourself for the past two years.</P>

<CENTER>So, sit back and relax and enter the wonderful world of Wally Dug.</CENTER>
