<CENTER>The freezer, fridge and larder don't contain very much,</CENTER>
<CENTER>So off to town we set ourselves in search of such and such,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Along with us we take our son to see what's to be had,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Not a clever idea is that;  we must be raving mad !</CENTER>

<CENTER>The supermarket car-park is a hellish sort of place,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Cars being used as dodgems against the human race,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All curses and hand signals, and tempers sorely frayed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Just to get in the parking spot for which you've dearly paid.</CENTER>

<CENTER>A trolley's a requirement to contain what you've in mind,</CENTER>
<CENTER>One that moves in a straight line is quite a unique find,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then laddie says "I'll push it!", and grabs hold of the cart,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You seize the thing back before he rips the store apart !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Idle hands make the Devil's work, or so most people say,</CENTER>
<CENTER>No-one is proof against this, when shopping in this way,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For off-spring has decided on a few more bargain buys,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As parents show a strange look of red mist in their eyes.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>The stock is moved about the store randomly once a week,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And those with impaired vision play a game of hide and seek,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For what was on the shelf right there is somewhere else instead,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Why did we even bother in getting out of bed?</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>And so off to the check-outs we fervently do go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To find a pretty young thing, on a constant <B>"Go-slow"</B>,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We bear the scars of battle from a thousand shopping carts,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And as we bag the produce, our young 'un loudly <B>farts</B> !</CENTER>

<CENTER>Embarrassment is hard to hide;  it's time for us to go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But youth has further on his mind - <B>"They've got a cafe,  I know"</B>.</CENTER>
<CENTER>We look outside at carnage,  and where we parked the car,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And both decide the dash to be just a little too far !</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Now I've been asked why most men just don't like shopping trips,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Well in this little poem you may just find some tips,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'd much prefer a quiet stroll,  with everything to hand,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Than all in one shop wrestling, with a basket in each hand !</CENTER>
