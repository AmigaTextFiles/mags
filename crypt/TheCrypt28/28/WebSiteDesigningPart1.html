<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a hot opinion that <B>"its the words that sell, not a
design" and that "</B> you should invest all your money into
writing a good sales copy and what is left (<I>if anything</I>)
into web-site". I can give you 99 out of 100 that authors of
these claims are copywriters, web-designers usually dont
write articles. It is like asking football player what game
he enjoys more: football or hockey? <B>:0)</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dont want to argue that statement about the importance of
copywriting, on the contrary, I think that it is totally
true, but under one condition  your Web-Site (<B>WS</B> <I>hereafter</I>)
is already implied to make your visitors feel, at least,
comfortable.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could never be counted, how many times I closed down the
browser without reading a single word, just because of the
amateurish and clumsy look those WSs had.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No need to emphasize on importance of the professional WS.
It is obvious, at the same time you wont read there, that
web-design is everything and that professional sales letter
or text message is nothing, because it is like answering the
question  what is better to have skin or heart cancer? To
my mind, it is better to be totally healthy.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Business WS usually plays the role of virtual office, shop,
informational dep., marketing dep. and service dep. It is a
main representative and the core of your business  the
final proof, the image of your company is based on.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The target is set  to make your WS as good as it can
possibly be. Here I pointed the crucial pillars of designing
a professional looking WS. You will not find there basic
HTML teaching or how to use particular web-editor. The
knowledge of HTML will help, but is not compulsory, as
<B>WYSIWYG </B>(<I>What You See Is What You Get</I>) editors will make all
HTML coding work behind the scene for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You require general understanding of what HTML is and
ability to use one or several WYSIWYG web-editors, that is
three hour learning process. The feeling of style and taste
is also advisable; otherwise you will have to consult a
designer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with design How to.. is that WS design is 90%
creative work, where is no two identical WS (<I>unless copied</I>),
that is why there cannot be any step-by-step study, the same
way there is no step-by-step study on how to paint a
masterpiece paint.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we can teach is how to hold a brush, but it is you,
who should paint Mona Lisa and become Leonardo da Vinci.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=RED><B>+</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> Stylish. Consider it as an exterior and interior of your
whole off-line business premises, starting from hall
(<I>main-index web-page</I>) and ending with your personal office
(<I>about me web-page</I>). It has to have its unique feel and
style. Dont also forget about branding features your WS
represent.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=RED><B>+</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> Clear structure. Imagine a shopper who wants to make a
purchase at your offline store, but in order to enter it, he
has to go through warehouse, service department and all
kinds of office premises. Dont allow your web visitor feel
like that shopper.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=RED><B>+</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> Harmonically allocated design elements like graphics and
text. The WS is united entity and your brand. Every element
on the WS is to be blend with exterior, no separated
elements or graphics like a number of flashy banners.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=RED><B>+</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> High usability standards and complete WS optimization
including clear HTML code and optimized web graphics that
are similar to clear shop. The more dirt your web-pages
contains, the more time it will take to load them, the more
potential errors it may show in different browsers, and the
harder it will be for Search Engine spiders to index your
WS. We will discuss these issues later on.
Pay also attention to broken links, as it is similar to wall
behind the door of your off-line shop. Let your visitors
find good resources with your help, rather than an Error
404 Page not found.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR=RED><B>+</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> Absence of grammatical errors. It concerns grammatical
correctness of textual information. The importance of
correct grammar is clear, no one wants to deal with
uneducated people, especially if they represent businesses.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<BR>
<CENTER>TASKS DEFINING.</CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You next step after setting up the appropriate web-design
program is to set the list of tasks your site should solve.
You should answer the following questions:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>1.</B> Are your WS a sales letter or a content rich project?
Depending on your answer you have or dont have to pay
attention to the structure and flexibility of navigational
menu, as it may bring new challenges, as your content-rich
WS will grow. Consider to reserve WS space to future
informational blocks like announcements, exclusive offers,
visitors voting, polls, that you may like to include
sometime in future. Dont make the page layout look too
tight, as you will require redesigning the whole page just
to insert a small table for visitors voting.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>2.</B> What kind of integrated services you are planning to use?
Whether it is going to be shopping cart, discussion board,
chat or separate section totally devoted to the WS
newsletter, it should fit overall site layout and design.
Think in prospective, as it will take several hours now, but
avoid several weeks of headache in the future. Make sure
that the foundation of your online empire will bear all
possible additional storeys, without need of demolishing the
whole building and strengthening the foundation.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>3. </B>What market sector your WS belongs to in general and what
product/service you are going to offer in particular? If
your WS is an entertainment portal, full of flash games,
casino offers and reviews of upcoming PC games, it is
obvious that design and layout plays extremely important
role as a representative of more than 50% of all
information. Be sure that boring graphics in that case would
cut the roots of your WS growth. If, on the other hand, you
are working at corporate business-to-business online sector
(B2B), there is absolutely no need in complex graphics
elements or flashy stars in the top-left corner. Online
businesses always experience lack of time, therefore, they
need quick answers of who you are, what you are and why are
you, rather than waiting till your welcome 300Kb flash clip
will load. The answer to efficient finding partners among
businesses is textual and to the point information that is
easy to access and that is, usually, represented in business
white-gray-black color scheme.</P>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><CENTER>VISUALLY FINISHED.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anybody can do that, although the broader imagination you
have, the simpler it will be. What you need is comfortable
seat, paper and a pen. Put your feet on the table, close
your eyes and imagine your WS.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me only tell you one of my favorite jokes concerning
technique mentioned above.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>There was a group of foreign visitors coming to see a very
prosperous and profitable company</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>At the end of their excursion one of the visitors asked
their guide</I>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>You know, your company is really perfect, with the best
technology Ive ever seen, everybody is working very hard,
but, tell me, who is that man in the biggest room on the top
floor doing nothing but relaxing on the soft armchair with
his feet crossed on the table, sipping Cola and listening to
music</I>?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Oh, that man came up with the idea last year, that earned us
$1.000.000, and, as far as I remember, during that time he
was also sipping Cola with his feet on the table</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So follow this man and don't allow anybody disturb you
during this work!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't make any mistakes about it. You may be surprised, but
it is the most challenging and crucial part of your WS
creation. The brighter efforts you put into your paper, the
more beneficial result you will get. No need for degree in
painting, just basic elements on paper as a background of
your future WS building, the rest in mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dont be afraid to experiment! Its a pleasant time spending
anyway. Remember  all great works of all times are
considered to be masterpieces, only because they, firstly,
perfectly reflect the depth of their creators souls and,
secondly, they are unique in their nature. There is no
masterpiece based on well-known standards. They are good in,
lets say, decreasing production costs, but they are not
welcomed in the art creation process, which the design
surely is.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, you should always keep in mind that the
experiment ends exactly when the web-surfer disappointment
starts.</P>
<BR></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><CENTER>ELEMENTS.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key point, while visualizing your full color WS, is to
decide what and where will you place 3 basic elements:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>1.</B> Header.<BR>
<B>2.</B> Navigational menu.<BR>
<B>3.</B> Space for main text.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following list represents possible WS elements that you
consider to have as a result of previously conducted Task
Defining. Designer should also reserve a proper place and
harmonically blend them with the rest of WS elements:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>1.</B> Banner ads;<BR>
<B>2.</B> Menu mirror at the bottom;<BR>
<B>3. </B>Additional text for news column, announcements,
testimonials etc.;<BR>
<B>4.</B> Email forms, visitor polls, questionnaire etc.;<BR>
<B>5.</B> Any other items you consider to include.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be stressed that all the main elements of the WS as
well as any other WS items, which should be added at your
sole discretion ought to be put in mind while visualizing,
and therefore written down on paper to be sure there is no
forgotten element left behind. If it occurs at the next
stage you will have to start from the very beginning as
there is no way to move further. So don't quadruple your
work with your own hands. Make sure you have put every
present into the box you want to receive on Christmas. <B>;0)</B></P>
<BR>
</font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><CENTER>WS STRUCTURE AND LAYOUT</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Draw the scheme of your WS structure. How you are planning
to arrange, link and create logically relations between
sections or stand alone web-pages. It is easy to navigate
four-page sales letter WS, but everything changes when we
are exploring 100 spontaneously linked WS. It is easier to
get out of Sahara desert rather than to find what you need.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your navigational structure could be linear or functional.
There are unlimited number of variations, just pay close
attention and follow one simple rule:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The more difficult for you to write a WS structure, the
more difficult it will be for potential user to navigate
 it!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It doesnt depend on number of web pages rather then logical
sequence and connection of different parts or sections of
your site.</P>
<BR></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<FONT COLOR=BLUE><CENTER>COLORS</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ive also read numerous times, that Headlines is what the
visitor sees first, when comes to your site. Wrong! The
first thing a surfer sees on the WS, while it loads, is the
color and, sometimes, design appearance. Dont underestimate
the importance of color influence. With the help of color
play you can easily create a feeling of excitement or grief
even before s/he will see the first letter of your Headline.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One note should be also mentioned: try, if possible, to
avoid main colors  green, red, yellow, blue. They are very
Day-Glo and very annoying while using them in the company
Logo sometimes considered to be enticing.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dont use aggressive color scheme, make it to be "polite"
to your customer's perception. By doing so, you don't, at
least, make your visitor be irritated. Just experiment with
hues and brightness and you will get the color you need.
Follow this rule if you are not intend to sell clown noses
in the circus tent. <B>:0)</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Text color is also ought to match the background color.
Please, avoid red text on green color, dark blue on black
etc.</P>
