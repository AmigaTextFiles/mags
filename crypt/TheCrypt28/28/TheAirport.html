<CENTER>The farmer, wife and children, stand outside in the sun.</CENTER>
<CENTER>To welcome the beginning, of a new day just begun,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Surveying green and pleasant land, with trees and grass and lakes,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Before the county planners add just a few mistakes.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>An airport is the very thing we need to let us grow,</CENTER>
<CENTER>With hundreds of new domiciles, all lined up in a row !</CENTER>
<CENTER>Not to forget new motorways; the airport for to feed,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And bring with them pounds sterling, to satisfy our greed.</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>But when the plans were published, there came a mighty shout,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's obvious you beggars don't know what you talk about -</CENTER>
<CENTER>T' airport'll be the aquatic type; normally three feet under,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Are passing Tench the only things that you will have to plunder?"</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Councillors, clergy, mums and dads raised forth a clear objection,</CENTER>
<CENTER>That's such a crazy location for such a fine erection,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To do that you'll bulldoze the homes of many local folk,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We certainly don't take this as a certain type of joke !</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Your plan is just plain lunacy; we think you've lost the plot,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And if you think we're impressed, we most surely are not.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Too much of England's countryside has been built on already,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's time you took inventory, and went a little steady !</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>We do not need incessant noise, and showers of paraffin,</CENTER>
<CENTER>If you don't mind those side effects, you put up with the din,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We like our rural setting, it's just the thing for us,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As for the airport, and your plans; well guess who's missed the bus !</CENTER>
