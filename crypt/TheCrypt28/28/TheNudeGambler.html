<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two bored casino dealers were waiting at a craps table. A very attractive blonde woman arrived and bet $20,000.00 on a single roll of the dice.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She said, "<B>I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm completely nude.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and yelled, "<B>Mama needs new clothes!</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then she hollered..."<B>YES! YES! I WON!</B>" She jumped up and down and hugged each of the dealers. She then picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dealers just stared at each other dumbfounded. Finally, one of them asked, "<I>What did she roll</I>?"</P>

The other answered, "I don't know I thought <B>YOU</B> were watching!"
