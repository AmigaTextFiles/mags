<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's exciting this.  We have decided to make this into a bigger experience, and get 
value for money.  After much discussion, and trying to hold me down, the days 
have been spent getting equipment together, to allow us to make a full record of 
the whole experience, and to attempt to capture something of the excitement of 
the day for all to share.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We thought it would be interesting to hear other trainees views on the course which 
they will be attending with me and also hear from the railway staff regarding their 
views on the day.  For those of you tempted to try the course, you will be able to 
see what it entails and know what is expected from you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We have purchased a couple of dictaphones for interviewing purposes and 
hopefully to capture some sounds, and will be taking cameras for a pictorial record.  
A video will be made, primarily for a keepsake, but who knows?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The car has had it's tank filled, the youngster has been accommodated with friends 
for the evening, and we await the sound of the alarm to wake us at the crack of 
dawn.</P>
