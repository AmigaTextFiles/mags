<BR><BLOCKQQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<CENTER>One day I took up a weird notion, to take a trip to Northern France,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All due to a good friend's suggestion, "Let's see what's to do there, by chance!"</CENTER>
<CENTER>So tickets were purchased,and ready we made, and departure day, it came around,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We boarded the coach, and set off for the south, for to set our feet on French ground.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>The coach ride were dead long, and I composed a song, as we rolled down t'motorway.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It was raining like heck and dead miserable, just the right way to start off the day.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Now, I've never been one, coach trips to rely upon; put up with it reluctantly,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But the silence were deadly from all those old folk, as we headed down to the sea.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>Then we boarded the ferry, and things brightened up, folk in high spirits were there,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And the spirits got higher, as we set sail, with Vodka and Gin everywhere!</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then all too soon, we arrived at port, then back onto a coach, to take us to a shopping mall,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A day of excitement, and laughter to boot- I really do not think so pal!</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>But inside the mall, my very good pal, saw several lassies ahead,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And accounted exactly what he'd like to do, as the idea took form in his head!</CENTER>
<CENTER>With thoughts such as those, most would keep rather quiet, but evidently not so he,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"<B>Safe as houses</B>" he mused, "<B>They don't understand!</B>" and that comment was directed at me.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>"I would not be so sure" was my cautious reply, "We aren't t'only English in here,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'll admit that yon lass, posseses what's called class", wishing I could just get out of there!</CENTER>
<CENTER>The cat-calling continued, and as we got near, her agitation I could tell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then she just spun around and uttered a curse, and in Northern English as well!</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>Well, I laughed till I cried, I near split a side, "I had warned you now, didn't I",</CENTER>
<CENTER>He was red-faced and sombre for quite a long while, as I wiped the tears from my eye.</CENTER>
<CENTER>When we left the mall we went6 down to the town, as French as a french town could be,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Clutching at a phrase book we first had a look, then we noticed a Patisserie.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>"I right bloody starving"</B> stated my pal; I thought "This'll be good for a crack",</CENTER>
<CENTER>So through the French Phrase Book he thumbed, till he found the said phrase at the back,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I thought that my French vocabulary wasn't much, until with the language, he spoke,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The lady in the store did something I adored, and in <I>Manchunian</I> said to t'bloke,</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>"Excuse me for t'laughter, now what are you after?, our filled croissants are very good,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But get rid of your phrase book, it's telling you wrong, you'll never be well understood",</CENTER>
<CENTER>At this he was flummoxed, and set all to odds, and I explained carefully to him,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"English here's taught at school, and that is the rule, for a profit from the English to make!"</CENTER>
