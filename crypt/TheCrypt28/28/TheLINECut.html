 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A woman from Oklahoma has a slight accent. When she lived in
 the south, she would take her cats to the groomers and have what is
 called a <B>Line Cut</B>.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To her...a <B>line cut</B> is when all of the fur hanging down below
 the cat's  tummy is taken off (because it gets matted or snarled). When she
 moved Chicago, one of the cats fur got all
 tangled up during the move so she took it in for a<B> line cut</B>. She was
surprised when she heard the price was twice as much as down south.</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She confirmed with the groomer that he understood what a <B>line cut</B> was and he said "yes, I
 know what a <B>LION cut</B> is." It seems her accent came out sounding like <B>LION</B>
not <B>LINE</B> and this is how her cat was returned to her.</P>
