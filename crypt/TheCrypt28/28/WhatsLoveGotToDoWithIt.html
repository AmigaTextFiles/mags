<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The perfect card, the perfect gift, the perfect date . . . Isn't there 
enough pressure in relationships without having to live up to some 
romantic ideal on Valentine's Day?  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not how the celebration of February 14 started out.  Its origins 
stem from Pagan and Christian history. Back then there were feasts 
celebrating fertility, and later there was recognition of St. Valentine 
(<I>whose actual existence is questioned by some experts</I>) who secretly 
performed marriage ceremonies for soldiers when the emperor had 
forbidden it.  But there were no TV commercials depicting models with 
perfect bodies and perfect teeth giving each other chocolates and back 
rubs. Valentine's Day back then was not a test of how good a lover you 
were.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modern relationships are difficult enough without having to stage a 
major performance on a designated day.  Men agonize over the 
greeting card racks, hoping that they can choose a card that is not too 
funny, not too mushy.  And the gift: how will she interpret it?  If I buy 
her chocolates will she think I want her to get fat?  If I don't buy her 
chocolates will she think I assume she is fat? Is the gift too 
extravagant?  Is it too impersonal? Are roses too predictable?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not what love is all about.  Love is much more complex than 
flowers and chocolates.  Social psychologists have been studying 
interpersonal attraction and love for almost four decades, and they still 
haven't figured it out completely.  What is known, however, is that love 
relationships are multi dimensional.  Sexual attraction, or what some 
people call <B>"chemistry"</B> is only one ingredient of a love relationship, and 
often not even the most important one.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distinctions have been made between passionate love and 
companionate love.   Passionate love is an intense longing for the other 
person.  It is accompanied by extreme feelings: ecstasy when things are 
going well, and despair when things are rocky.  Passionate love is also 
characterized by physical sensations, such as rapid heartbeat and 
<B>"butterflies"</B> in the stomach.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Companionate love does not have the fire and the heat that passionate 
love does, but it can more than compensate in the form of closeness, 
trust and affection.  Furthermore it lasts much longer than passionate 
love, which subsides relatively quickly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another way of defining love is in terms of three components: <B>passion</B>, 
<B>commitment</B> and <B>intimacy</B>.  These interact with one another in various 
combinations, so that no two relationships are alike.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Long-term satisfaction in relationships does not depend on material 
wealth or success.  Nor does it depend on physical attractiveness.  A 
recent study of middle-aged college graduates indicated that good 
looking people, on average, were no more satisfied with their marriages 
or with their lives, than were plainer people.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what does constitute long-term contentment in relationships?  
Psychologists have found that a feeling of equity is important.  That is, 
the partners feel they are each getting about as much as they're 
giving.  Not that they keep score, but over the long run things even out.  
This is similar to just being good friends to one another, supporting one 
another, laughing at each other's jokes even though you've heard them 
dozens of times. Another ingredient in long-term relationships is 
investment.  This refers to material possessions, time and emotional 
investment.  The greater the investment, the more likely the couple will 
stay together. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what does all this have to do with Valentine's Day?  If you wish, buy 
that card or those flowers, but keep in mind that this is not a maker or 
breaker of a relationship.  Better yet, show your partner love and 
consideration on the other 364 days in the year.  It will make a greater 
impact than doing so according to the calendar.</P>
