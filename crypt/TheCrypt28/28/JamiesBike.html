<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Little Jamie came into the kitchen where his mother was 
dinner. His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good 
time to tell his mother what he wanted. '<B>Mum, I want a bike for my 
birthday.</B>' </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Jamie was a bit of a troublemaker. He had gotten into 
trouble at school and at home on many occasions. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jamie's mum asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his
 birthday.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Jamie, of course thought he did. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jamie's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted Jamie to reflect on 
his behaviour over the last year. '<I>Go to your room, Jamie, 
and think about how you have behaved this year. Then write a letter to God 
and tell  him why you deserve a bike for your birthday</I>.'</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Jamie stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write God a letter. </P>

<B>Dear God: </B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a

Your friend, <BR>

Dear God: <BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have been an 'OK' boy this year. I still would really like

<P ALIGN="LEFT">God, I know I haven't been a good boy this year. I am very 
sorry. I will be a good boy if you just send me a red bike for my 
birthday.</P> 
Please! <BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jamie knew, even if it was true, that this letter was not 
going to get him a bike. By now, he was very upset. He went downstairs
 and told his mum that he wanted to go to church.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Jamie's mother thought her plan had worked as 
Jamie looked very sad.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> '<I>Just be home in time for dinner</I>,' Jamie's mother told him. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jamie walked down the street to the church on the corner. He 
went into the church and up to the altar. He looked around to see if 
anyone was there. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jamie bent down and picked up a statue of the <B>Virgin Mary</B>.</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">He slipped it under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street, 
into the house, and up to his room. He shut the door to his room and sat
 down with a piece of paper and a pen. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Jamie began to write his letter to God.</P>
