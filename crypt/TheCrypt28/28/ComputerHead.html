<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't open attachments that you didn't ask for,  even if you think
you know who's sending them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If something asks to install itself on your computer, just say no.
If  it's  something you really really want,  call  or  email  your
local computer geek and ask how to proceed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sign  up  for  a computer class.  It's a proven fact  that  family
members are terrible at teaching the basics.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Do  not give out credit card information to anybody through e-mail
or an instant messenger, no matter how official it sounds.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Do  not  eat  or  drink  near  your computer  system  unless  your
hardware is coffee compatible (most aren't).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">CTRL+Z  will  usually reverse the last thing you did,   no  matter
where you are or what you're doing.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If  something doesn't easily fit into one of those  plugs  in  the
back,  don't force it;  chances are,  it's not supposed to  go  in
there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Memory is not the same thing as a hard drive; memory is also known as RAM, 
which is where programs and open documents are loaded. The hard drive is 
where your files sit, waiting for you to put them into memory. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Here's a good analogy:  your hard drive is your filing cabinet and
your  desk  drawer that's where your files and  your  tools  (like
your pen and stapler)  are kept.  Memory is your desktop when  you
want  to  work  on a project,  you take a file out of  the  filing
cabinet  and  a  tool out of the desk drawer and  put  it  on  the
desktop.  On the computer,  you take a program and a file  out  of
the hard drive and put it in memory.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There's  more  than one way to complete a  task.   If  you  ask  a
question of 10 computer geeks,  you will more than likely  get  10
different answers and they' ll probably all be right.  Don't let
this  confuse  you    just keep plugging  away  and  eventually
you'll find your own favorite way of doing things.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't  get mad at the computer when something doesn't work;  don't
get  mad  at  yourself when something doesn't work.  The  computer
won't always work the way you want it to;  what you're  trying
to  do  won't always work the way you want it to.  That's  the
nature of the beast.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You're probably not going to get hacked;  if you're worried,   ask
your computer geek how to protect yourself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Forwarding joke emails is not funny.  It may be new to you, but be
assured that anyone who's been using the Internet and email for  a
while has seen that joke at least several times already.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Internet  doesn't always move as fast as you'd  like  it  to.
Your  computer doesn't always move as fast as you'd  like  it  to.
That doesn't mean there's something wrong. Be patient.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't respond to special offer emails if you didn't ask for them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Keep  all  of  your  saved  files,    word  processing  documents,
spreadsheets,  emails,  pictures, etc. in the My Documents folder.
Whenever a program asks you to save something somewhere,  save  it
in there.  This way,  you'll always know where to look when you're
trying to find something.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There's  more  on  your computer than email and  Solitaire.   Look
around, try things you'll be amazed at all you can do!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  won't need to upgrade everything tomorrow;  your system  will
not be obsolete until it can't do something you need it to do.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Your computer can hold mountains of programs,  files,  emails  and
whatever else you want to save. You don't need to erase files yet.
Remember,  you cannot kick off the next world war by pressing  the
wrong key.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Have fun!  If you take this activity too seriously, you won't want
to play with the computer too often.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  desktop  can  become cluttered with shortcuts  to  often-used
programs  that we always open when we turn the computer  on.   You
can  have  Windows automatically open these for you by  placing  a
shortcut to the program in your startup folder.  You'll  find  the
startup folder in the Start button menus.  Click the Start button,
point to Programs,  and then point to Startup.  Everything you see
in  there automatically opens when you turn your computer on.  (If
you  don't recognize everything in there,  note that some programs
run behind the scenes and you'll never see them)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An  easy way to add a program to the Startup is to first  place  a
shortcut to the folder on your desktop this way:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Right click on Start and select Open</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Left click on Programs (you may have to double click, depending on your 
version of Windows)</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Point to the Startup folder.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Right click on it and left click Send To from the resulting menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Click on Desktop (Create Shortcut). </P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">From  now  on,   when you have a program you want to automatically
startup,   drag the shortcut to the Startup icon on your  desktop.
The  next  time you restart your system,  that program  will  open
automatically.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you just got a new computer this holiday season and you donât like the new 
look of Windows XP, this tip is for you!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can go back to the Windows Classic Desktop (the one youâre used to if you 
used 95, 98 or ME) with just a few clicks.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Right-click on your desktop, and then click Properties.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Click the Appearance tab.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On the Windows and Buttons menu, select Windows Classic and click OK.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now you can feel right at home with the old Windows look.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you don't, you should, it's a great way to discover new shortcuts. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you right click on an icon, a context menu will pop up filled with 
actions that you can do with that object. The context menu will be different 
depending on where you right click.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Go ahead, try right clicking on everything you can see. Even a blank spot on 
your desktop has a useful context menu when right clicked.</P>

<FONT COLOR=RED><CENTER><B><U>Internet Explorer Keyboard Shortcuts</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Here are a few Internet Explorer shortcuts that you may find useful.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- To search for a particular word or phrase on a web page just press CTRL + F 
to open the Find dialog.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Hold down the shift key when you click a link to have it open in a new 
window. If you plan on returning to that page, a new window is faster to open 
and close than backing up through pages.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press the Backspace key on your keyboard to go back a page, or press ALT + 
the Left Arrow. ALT + the Right Arrow goes forward a page, and ALT + Home 
take you to your home page.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press the Spacebar to move  down the page one screen length. Hold the shift 
key down as you press the Spacebar to jump UP the page. Use the Up and Down 
Arrows to scroll slower.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- In IE 5.5 and above, in most cases you can just type "domain_Name.com" 
instead of typing the "www" first. IE knows to search for it on the web. 
Works for most sites, but a few can't be found without the www â thatâs a 
problem with that site and not Internet Explorer.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press the F11 key to open your browser into full screen mode. This hides 
all the other stuff that can get in your way of viewing things. Press it 
again to leave full screen mode.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- CTRL + O opens the dialog to type in a web address. Useful for full screen 
mode surfers.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Right-click the tool bar and select Auto-hide. This hides the tool bar for 
true full screen surfing. To use the hidden tool bar, just move your mouse to 
the top edge of the screen. Move your mouse away and it disappears again.  
(Note:  You can do this with your taskbar too, by clicking the Start button, 
pointing to settings, and clicking Taskbar & Start Menu. Then place a check 
by the Autohide feature and click Apply.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press the F5 key to reload the page. Press F4 & F5 at the same time to have 
the page reloaded at the page top instead of wherever you had scrolled to.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press the Esc key to stop the current page from loading.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Press CTRL + N to open the current page in a new window.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- All the usual shortcuts work as well. CTRL + P opens the print dialog, CTRL 
+ A highlights everything on the page, CTRL + C copies what you have 
highlighted.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- To get a drop-down list of recently-visited pages, click F4.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- To highlight (select) the address, click F6.  Then just type in the address 
of the web page you want to go to.  </P>

 <FONT COLOR=RED><CENTER><B><U>Use Two Browser Windows At Once</U></B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ability to use a browser, and understand that multiple browser windows 
can be opened, can work wonders for you. One example is shopping on the 
Internet: comparing items and prices at two different websites. Another 
example, doing research: what does one website say about your topic as 
opposed to the other website? It's easy to compare information when you call 
up two web sites with two browsers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here's how you can use two or more browsers: Start one browser. Type in an 
address, and while the page is loading, start up another browser instance. 
(Each time you click to start your browser is an instance of that browser.) 
To start another browser, either open it up from the Start button menu, or 
use the keyboard shortcut, ctrl + n.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that you've got your second browser window open, type another address. 
That second page loads. Now, you can switch between the two pages by clicking 
on the buttons on the taskbar or by using Alt+Tab or Alt+Esc. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There really is no end to the number of browsers you can have running, but of 
course, there is a practical limit. All the browser does is request 
information from a server computer. Once that info is displayed, it just sits 
there. The browser has done its job; but after you're done with the 
information, that window, and taskbar button, may just be getting in your 
way.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you're done, you may want to close all but one of the open browser 
windows. Keep one open but move it out of your way by clicking on the 
minimize button in the top right corner of your screen. This moves the window 
down to your task bar, where it sits waiting to be opened again by simply 
clicking on it.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Question:</B>  <I>Somehow I have lost my task bar at the bottom of my screen.  It 
shows up when I am at my desktop though. </I> </P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">Answer:It sounds like your taskbar (that gray area at the bottom of the screen) is 
either set on auto hide, or it is not set to always be on top. Either way, 
you can fix it by following these directions:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">1. Right click on your taskbar and click Properties.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">2. Make sure there is a check mark in front of Always on top (or in XP it 
will say Keep the taskbar on top of other windows)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">3. While you are there, make sure there is no check mark in front of Auto 
Hide.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">4. Click OK and you will be done.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Note:</B>  Always on top does <B>NOT</B> mean that the taskbar will appear at
the top of the screen;  it will be on top of other windows,  still
at the bottom of the screen.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  can use this feature to add space to your desktop.  If  you'd
like to have a larger area to display program windows,  change the
taskbar  to  Auto  Hide (follow steps above.  When  you  need  the
taskbar,  point the mouse at the bottom of the screen; the taskbar
will  display.  When the mouse is not at the bottom of the screen,
the taskbar will hide behind the active window.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Question:</B> <I>I  bought  an Audio CD,  which I would like to copy to my harddisk,
in order to backup the CD,  also I want to copy,  and convert the
Tracks to MP3.</I></P>

<I>Is   there a way to get around this new Copy Control,  so  that  I
can copy the CD, to the hardisk etc.</I> ?

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>It is important to know that,  I will only copy, use  the Audio CD
for  private  purpose.</I></P>
 <BR>
<BR> 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Answer:</B> You can take a black felt tip pen and go around the outer edge  of
the CD and that will disable the Copy Control.   However,  do  not
do  this with the original CD.  Make a copy and try it out on  the
copy.   You  need good lighting and a steady hand to  put  a  line
through the data track on the CD.  Again I would like to emphasise
this is for your personal use. <B>; )</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Question:</B>  <I>At the bottom of my screen,  the task bar is twice  the
size  it  should be,  as in twice as deep as the Start button  and
the clock. How can I change it back to the original size</I>?</P>
<BR>
<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Answer:</B> It's easy to change the height of your taskbar.  You might have to
try  this  a  couple of times,  but once you get the hang  of  it,
it's pretty simple.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Point  your  mouse  to  the top edge of  your  taskbar  until  the
pointer turns into a vertical double-headed arrow.  Hold down  the
left  mouse  button and drag up or down.  The taskbar will  become
higher or lower.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you have quite a few programs open,  it can be very helpful  to
increase the size of your taskbar;  you'll then be able to  read
the  text  on  the buttons for the opened windows.  When  you're
down  to only two or three open programs,  then decrease the  size
of the taskbar to give yourself more room on the desktop.</P>
