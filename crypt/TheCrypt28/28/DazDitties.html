<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two race horses sat in a pub, one horse says to the other, "<B>You`ll never guess what happened to me today.!  I was racing in the 1.30pm at Redcar,  I hit a fence, fell and lost the race.!</B>".</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other horse says "<B>Funny you should say that `cos the exact same thing happened to me. I was racing in the 12.45pm at Cheltenham and I hit the fence, dismounted the jockey, fell and lost the race.!</B>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suddenly, a greyhound sitting next to them says "<B>Ok lads, I couldn`t help over hearing what you were saying but a similar thing happend to me today. I was racing in the 2.45pm at Doncaster and I took a bend too fast, skidded off and lost the race.!</B>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The two horses looked at each other and said  "<B>Bloody hell.!!  A talking Greyhound.!</B>"</P>
