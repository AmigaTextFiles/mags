<P ALIGN="LEFT">I suppose the whole thing started when I was about 7.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1962, my parents took my brother, sister and I, on a caravan holiday
from Suffolk where we live, to Liverpool to visit Dad's relations.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After that, every year for a fortnight, they'd hire a caravan from a local
dealer, and we'd stop in a campsite in Cheshire, and dive through the
Mersey Tunnel, or board the ferry, to get to Liverpool.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway, the seed was sown.  I wanted to become a <B>caravanner</B>!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many moons later, I bought my first 'van!  It was only a little Sprite 400,
but it had an awning, and it was mine!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">About 4 years ago, when I got Internet access, I joined two groups.  One
was The Ripper, but after Baz went slightly doolally, I moved to the Crypt.
The other group was Clic, or Chat Line for Internet Campers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One member of Clic was Allen Hughes.  He, and his beloved Ann-Jean, and Mac
the dog, spent from Easter to late September at Roundhill, in The New
Forest.  Then they'd hitch up and go back home to Yorkshire for the winter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allen would send e-mails from his caravan, telling us of the antics of his
grandchildren, stories of his childhood, tales of friends old and new, and
also ideas that would pop into his head.  If anyone had a problem or query,
he'd do his very best to help them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sadly, in 2001, Ann-Jean passed away.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Clic as a community was upset.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At the end of the 2002 season, after a short illness, Allen joined her.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Clic was devastated.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was near Southampton in early summer of 2002, but I didn't think I had
the time to visit Allen.  How bitter I feel now for a wasted opportunity!</P>

Late last year, one of the Clicer's suggested an Easter Roundhill meet. <BR>
This was looked upon with approval by all.<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After a couple of hiccups, a list of potential attendees was drawn up, and
the plans were made.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I booked in from the Thursday to the Tuesday, and made other plans to
return in convoy with another Clicer.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ruth, my wife, told me she couldn't get time off work, Katie needed to
catch up with some school work, and Fiona doesn't like camping.  So it
looked like it was just young Adam and yours truly.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The week preceeding Easter was warm, dry and sunny, which boded well for
our trip.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A couple of days before the off, I gave our 'van, an Elddis Cyclone, a
final going over, and the day before, loaded up all the provisions for the
trip.</P>

escaped at 12:30!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After a relatively uneventful journey, apart from the horrendous jams on
the M25, I phoned Clicer John, and told him that I was just turning into
the entrance, and there was a huge queue in front of me.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As we waited, a mature-ish gentleman ambled towards us, and introduced
himself as John, and told us where he was parked.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Roundhill is a Forestry Commission site, situated just off the Brockenhurst
road, about 3 miles away from Brockenhurst.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The site is approximately square, with each side measuring 
    about a mile. There are 500 pitches, but parking is left up to the individual. 
    This means that groups can park closer together, and those that wish to remain 
    isolated can do so. The site is undulating, but there aren't any huge hills! 
    There are toilet blocks, stand pipes for fresh water, chemical disposal points, 
    and waste bins dotted around, but no showers or electric hook-ups.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two roads servicing the site, but no hard-standings.  Bread and
milk may be purchased from the wardens, and they offer an ice-pack freezing
service, <B>but that's your lot!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After we'd booked in, we followed John's directions.  Clic were in two
small areas separated by a bank of trees and gorse bushes.  John and his
good lady were parked more or less in the middle, with Clicers Nik and Sue
to his left, and another John and Betty to their left.  Gaynor and Graeme
had their big Dodge van in the clearing on the other side of the bushes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As I pitched, John and Nik helped level the 'van, and drop the legs.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Adam was quite upset that night; it was his first night away from Mum, so I
promised that if he was still unhappy, we'd up sticks and go home on
Sunday.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day dawned bright and sunny, and immediately after breakfast, John came
and tapped on the door. Presently, we were joined by Gaynor and Graeme.  We
adjourned to their van, a big American Dodge Ram, with a 5.7-litre V8!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were alerted by another powerful rumble, and we watched a very clean
Bedford CF pull an Avondale Kingfisher onto the pitch next door.  Christine
and Derrick hopped out.  In turn, we helped them level their 'van, and
erect the awning.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having had a chat with Derrick, we ascertained that this Bedford had a very
sweet Rover V8 propelling it!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After that, I was suddenly aware that I hadn't seen AJ for a while.  He
rode past on a bike.  Which I thought was odd, as we'd left his bike in the
garage.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I ambled over in the general direction that he'd gone in, and found Lindsey
and her tribe.  Apparently, Adam had helped them set their tent up!  Great
fun for AJ, and he's now in love with Sarah (who's 14!) and Sian (12). They
and their brothers Steve (10) and Sam (9) just sort of adopted him!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I missed Batch and his family arriving.  One moment there was a lump of
empty field, and the next it was full of Bailey Ranger and Bradcot awning.
Mrs Batch (Sharon) is really lovely, and as mad as the rest of us!!  Their
two, Sam and Sarah (it gets confusing!) joined in the antics with Linz's
group, Adam, and a couple of other kids.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Batch's Ranger is 5 metres long, and the awning is 7 feet wide!  This adds
up to a huge area for entertaining in!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, seeming to just appear out of thin air, was Edd and Emma, with
daughter Anya.  Their Toyota Avensis had brought them and their ABI Jubilee
Viceroy from the Midlands.  Anya is 18 months old, and I don't think she
stopped smiling all the time we were there!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night, there was such fun in there (so I've heard!) which involved
Gaynor, a can of squirty cream, and some lap dancing.  I was trundling back
to my own tin-tent with AJ, for an early night.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the way back from the toilet block, Adam told me that he might just stay
until Tuesday after all!</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was woken rudely at around 5:30am by a meandering bovine 
    giving voice about 6 feet from where I was peacefully sleeping. I have never 
    heard a cow sound like it! I'm damn sure it had swallowed a megaphone.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I eventually got back to sleep.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually, after brekkie, we venture forth.  This is when I was accosted
by several Clicers all wanting to know where I was the previous night, and
had I heard about the squirty cream/lap dancing?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There was going to be another get together tonight, bad behaviour
compulsory.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Actually there would be two get togethers, one was the barbeque, and the
second was a gathering to raise a glass in honour of Allen.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partway through the day, a Fiat Punto bearing two Northface tents and three
mad Irish backpackers appeared!  It was Sooosssaaannn, hubby Philip, and
beautiful daughter Katie.  The tents were set up in moments, and
Sooosssaaannn produced a rather large drinking vessel!</P>

More surprising was the fact that wine bottles kept topping it up! <BR>
  Surprising because Sooosssaaann was supposed to have been on the wagon!<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At around 6, everyone congregated near to 'Allen's Glade' and had a
barbeque, but the weather was cold and windy, so we retired to Batch's
awning.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a few minutes before 9, all the Clicers, braved the elements, and
toasted the memory of Allen and other Clicers gone to that great camp-site
in the sky.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Then back to The Batch's Arms for more drunken revelry!!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Adam helped me home, I made the beds up, got him into his sleeping bag,
sat on the bed, and broke it!!</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">At about 4 am, I was really thankful that we'd got a Porta-Potti!! 
    That Becks contains a vast amount of vitamin P!!</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After we'd got dressed, I looked to see what damage I'd done to the 'van. 
When making the bed up for the night, the table is unhooked from the wall
bracket, the leg folds up, and the table top is slid into two grooves, one
along each front edge of the seat.  Some manufacturers prefer a wooden
batten, routed into an 'L' shape, but, on our Elddis, these are plastic,
and along one side, 2 of the 3 feet of plastic has cracked!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaynor called earlyish on, and gave AJ a nice Easter Egg, so we went out
and delivered those that we'd brought.  I did wonder if we were going to be
held responsible for making the kids sick, but everything seemed OK.....</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I gave Katie an Egg, and she told me she'd love me forever!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We went into Lyndhurst to see if the caravan shop could offer anything to
effect even a temporary repair.  Sadly, nothing doing.  It's a lovely shop
to browse in though!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To cheer ourselves up a little, AJ and I went to Beaulieu.  I was a little
disappointed with the lack of commercial vehicles on display, and the
vehicles that were there seemed cramped.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AJ seemed to enjoy himself, and had a go on most of the rides!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you've never been to Beaulieu and want to, the Volvo display with the
crash test dummies is hilarious!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arrived back on site, Sian came galloping over and handed AJ a cereal bowl
full of mini-eggs and a couple of Creme Eggs.  They'd had an Easter Egg
hunt while we were out, and they'd saved a share for Adam!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At around 6:30 we all headed for Batch's awning and gave more of the booze
a bit of a seeing-to!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">AJ was a little down today; Edd is leaving for home in the morning, and
Batch is going after lunch.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Surprise!!</B> Howard Harbert has arrived!  He tried to get into Roundhill, but
was told it was full, so he went to another site about 10 miles away.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He's got a VW Transporter camper that he imported from Germany.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We help Edd pack up, and pull the ABI around so he can hitch up.  After
many hugs with Anya and Emma, we shake hands and they glide off.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Later that afternoon, we also help Batch dangle the Bailey on his Volvo. 
Again, hugs and kisses with the ladies, and we all wave them off.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm suddenly aware that we haven't seen much of Susie Pooh today.  It's
getting on for tea-time, and she hasn't done vertical yet!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adam and I have tea at ours, as Linz feeds her brood, we'll go back for a
while later.  We're leaving in the morning, so I decide to drink coffee. 
Linz is also leaving, so she decides to leave the alcohol alone.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Howard turns up, and we manage a nearly adult conversation!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Crypt</B> was discussed reasonably heavily, and at around 10, we say
goodnight.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AJ is really unhappy because we're going home.  He's told both Sarah's and
Sian that he loves them, and they've all got each others mobile numbers!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I've found two more campers that knew Allen, and had a chat with them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I've emptied the Porta-Potti and the waste tank for the last time.  We've
moved everything that can fall down, and it's time to lift legs.</P>

I heave the Xantia into reverse and get the ball under the hitch-head. <BR>
  Wind up the legs and drop the jockey wheel, so that the ball engages. Hook on 
  the breakaway cable and plug in the 12N and 12S. A quick check to see that all 
  the tail-lights are performing as they should, and ready to go.<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally remember to stick the towing mirrors on!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We walk around the site, saying goodbye to all our new friends, and
promising to be back next year.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A relatively uneventful journey home, and smiles, hugs and kisses from the
family Cuddles!</P>

After a chat with Mrs Cuddles, I decide that there's a bit of work to do
on the Cyclone, and I could spend quite a lot of time and money on it. <BR>
<B>But do I want to?</B><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In monetary terms, it isn't worth an awful lot, and I could spend £300 on
new upholstery and curtains.  That would add about 50 quid to it's price!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In realistic terms, it's dry, and it tows well. Yes, I could put some new
tyres on it, overhaul the hitch-head, service the corner-steadies and
replace the jockeywheel.  In fact I need to replace the jockeywheel, as the
tyre has disintegrated!  I could replace the fridge and the heater too, but
the old ones are still serviceable.  At the end of the day, all this work
wouldn't make it worth any more.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We've more or less decided to look for something a little newer.  We may be
offered a trade-in value on the Elddis, but I feel we'd be better off
selling privately.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm now looking for either a Sprite Musketeer, ABI Marauder, Avondale Leda,
or even a Monza.  I'd love a Bailey, but we can't run to one YET!!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We <B>WILL</B> be having an awning, and some outdoor furniture, and a radio in it!</P>
