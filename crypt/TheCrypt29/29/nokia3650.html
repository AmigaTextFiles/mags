<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nokia 3650 ($300 street),  a high-style, high-speed data phone
with  integrated  Bluetooth,  blurs the line between  feature-rich
phones and PDA/phone combos.  The 3650,  which functions primarily
as  a phone and camera,  is based on the Symbian operating system.
It  runs  the  Nokia  Series 60 graphical user interface  and  has
support for third-party applications.  The combination of an easy-
to-read  screen,   numerous  preinstalled  applications,   and  an
interface with icon navigation is a home run.  The plastic  phone,
with  its  minimalist  two-tone design and  circular  number  pad,
doesn't necessarily look like a business device,  but it's fun and
easy to operate.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  4.6-ounce  sculpted case measures 5.0 by 2.1  by  0.9  inches
(HWD)   and  is comfortable to hold.  You can buy the  phone  with
gray,  yellow, or dark blue top and bottom covers, each with white
trim.  You can also buy blue,  fuchsia,  and purple covers for $28
each.  One odd design feature-which we grew to appreciate in time-
is the phone's circular,  counterclockwise numeric keypad.  Having
the  numbers  in  a circle actually makes finding  them  fast  and
easy.   A  five-way navigation button,  smart keys,  and  software
icons make getting around in the interface simple.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  triband  GSM/GPRS phone supports voice  dialing  and  six-way
conference calling,  and a touch of a button lets you  access  the
impressive speakerphone.  Setting up unique ringers to distinguish
incoming callers is easy,  and you can record and store voice tags
for  speed  dialing.   Nokia  offers  several  attractive  headset
accessories for the 3650,  including the $120 Nokia HDW-2 Wireless
Bluetooth  Headset.   Nokia says the  phone's  battery  will  last
through 4 hours of talking or 8 days on standby.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Features  not  related  to   calling   abound.   The  3650's  most
impressive  extra is the integrated 640-by-480 resolution  digital
camera,  but the list goes on to include a video recorder, a voice
recorder,  a RealOne video player, and an XHTML browser. There's a
MultiMediaCard (MMC)  expansion slot and a 16MB MMC comes with the
phone.   You need to turn the phone off and remove the battery  to
access the card, though, which is a bit of a pain.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can take a photo from the main menu with two key presses.  The
relatively  large color display-1.6 by 1.4 inches (HW)-helps  with
image  composition and is equally legible indoors and in sunlight.
You  can select from three quality settings and three image  modes
(standard  landscape,  thumbnail portrait,   and,   for  a  longer
exposure,  night)  at resolutions up to the maximum of 640-by-480.
Printing  test photos transferred from the Nokia to an HP  Deskjet
995c via a Bluetooth connection was a snap.  Getting the phone  to
talk  to  the  printer  required no special configuration-possibly
the best feature.</P>
