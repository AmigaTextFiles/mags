<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been announced that the popular, and long running Amiga Magazine AIO is to close down later this year. AIO has been a faithful servant to the Amiga users for some 6 years, and will be sadly missed by many.</P>

<FONT COLOR=LIME>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>RIYAN Productions</B><FONT COLOR=BLACK> would like to 
    offer their thanks to all members of the AIO team, for not only their obvious 
    devotion to the Platform, but also all their hard work over the years.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We wish you all the best for the future.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>AMIGA  INFORMATION ONLINE</B> will sadly be closing with  the  release
of issue 71,  May 2003. After 6 years in production we feel we can
no  longer offer the Amiga market the kind of support it deserves.
With  the Amiga market getting smaller and smaller by the  day  we
can  no longer bring you as many reviews,  as much news or as many
articles  as we would like.  Instead of turning into a poorly  run
magazine we have decided to close from the May 2003 issue.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  will  be printing your goodbye comments in our last  issue  so
please  feel   free   to   send   your   goodbye   comments  to  :
