<CENTER>After a hectic week full of trouble and strife,</CENTER>
<CENTER>What you need is a day off that's spent with the wife.</CENTER>
<CENTER>With kids safely deposited at Sunday school,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You head off to the countryside to play the fool.</CENTER>

<CENTER><B>"I've heard of a market, a way out of town,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>That I'd like to see, as I've been a bit down!"</B></CENTER>
<CENTER>So toward the village you drive without sound,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To let your good lady have a look around.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>There's just one small thing she's forgotten to add,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Nowt but high class fashions; you won't be so glad.</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>"But 90% off is a pretty good price !"</B></CENTER>
<CENTER>~Till you look at a price tag that's not very nice.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>You look out of place, and so does the car,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The locals regard you from a distance afar,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's a motley collection of various bits,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Combined with the scars of two hundred odd hits.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>When parked up alongside Bentley and Ferrari,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It has the appeal of a phial of curare.</CENTER>
<CENTER>There's dents and rust spots here and there all over,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And designer bags, placed right next to the Clover!</CENTER>
