 <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>Hi All


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hi and welcome to issue 29 of the<FONT COLOR=RED> CRYPT<FONT COLOR=SILVER> on-line magazine (<FONT COLOR=LIME>Ghosts &
Ghouls<FONT COLOR=SILVER>)</font></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=LIME><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well regardless of your preference in computers, Whether you are
using a PC, a Mac or even an Amiga, we have a bumper selections of
articles for you this Issue.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within our pages you will find, help with computing problems,
reviews of software and more to satisfy every user.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All persons are catered for, so don't forget to check out our
Recipe pages, Steam corner and even the Domino Column (<I>A dogs eye
view on the latest war in Iraq</I>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving away for the Magazine for a brief moment, I have to say I
have been saddened and disturbed by a mail I read recently, on an
Amiga mailing list.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This poor unfortunate had decided that after all the years of
false hopes and promises, He had decided to sell his NEW AmigaOne
computer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main fact for this was his disappointment at having a BRAND
new machine (Amiga) but having to run Linux on it, because of the
unavailability of Amiga OS 4.0</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This poor chap has my sympathy. All my computing life I have been
an Amiga supporter and user. I have continued to use the platform,
while being plied with false hope after false hope. I have watched
the ending of the various Amiga magazines (CU Amiga Mag/Amiga
Format/AmigActive) ... and still I clung to my brief belief that
someday the Amiga might make a return.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strange thing was, that after each disappointment, the Amiga
users seemed to get stronger and support for the platform and the
user was still evident.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After waiting over 10 years for a New machine, they eventually
arrived in the shape of the AmigaOne. Companies like Eyetech etc.
who developed this new machine deserve a big pat on the back, as
do all those who bought the machine, without having the benefit of
professional reviews to assist them in their choice.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The release of the AmigaOne machine (minus the new operating
system OS 4.0) is understandable, These companies need to recoup
their expenditure in development/Production costs.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not one for listening to rumours on the grapevine, so let me
just say ... The hardware is here, So where is the Software
(surely a priority for the Amiga Company).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, like this other poor chap (and hundreds of others) feel we have
been badly let down by this. I am perhaps fortunate that I refused
to buy a machine without the OS being available (sorry Eyetech),
But currently my cash stays in my pocket.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>AMIGA</B> ...if you are out there ...</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>We don't want to buy an Amiga machine to run Linux ..We can do
that with a PC ...So Please get a grip, while you still have some
support from the user base.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Rant over :)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK back to the Magazine. We hope that you all enjoy this issue,
and please remember to visit our Guestbook and tell us what you
think of our site.</P>
