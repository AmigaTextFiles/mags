<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'm left handed, and, even though everyone tells me that most left
handed  people use their right hand for the mouse,  I'm  having  a
lot  of difficulty doing that.  Can I change this to a left handed
mouse?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  can  use  the  mouse  with your left  hand  and  just  switch
fingers:  click with your middle finger and use your index  finger
on the right button;  or,  you can change the clicking options. It
is  possible to change the clicking options of mice  so  that  the
click is driven from the left-hander's index finger.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  do  this,   click the Start button,  click control  panel  and
select  the  mouse  icon (if you're using Windows  XP,   click  on
Appearance and Themes,  then click Mouse on the left).  Under  the
buttons tab is the option to alternate your mouse buttons.   Since
the  option  will vary,  depending on your version of Windows  and
the  mouse software,  look for either Change Primary Buttons,   or
right-handed/left-handed.  Make the switch and then you can  click
with the index finger.</P>

indication that you're dealing with a hoax.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"> Look out for pseudo-technical discussions on the dangers of the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Images/star01.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" ALT="star.gif"> To create an impression of credibility,  a hoax often quotes  a
well-known  company  or agency,  such as Microsoft,   the  Federal
Communications Commission,  or an antivirus company. Check the Web
sites  of  the  sources  quoted (or see  your  antivirus  vendor's
site).  Remember also that Microsoft never posts virus alerts  via
e-mail.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you're finding that you are having to repeatedly double-click over and 
over to get Windows to perform an action, you may have your double-click 
timing too high.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go to the Control Panel and double-click the mouse icon. In 
    the resulting dialog box, select the Buttons tab and move the slider more 
    toward the slower end. You can test the speed by double-clicking the Jack-In-The 
    Box or Dolphin (depending on your Windows version) to get the right speed. 
    Click Apply and try again. If it's still too fast, or now it's too slow, adjust 
    it again.</P>

  <B><U>What is Virtual Memory?</U></B>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Virtual memory is nothing more than storing what Windows 
    cannot fit into the RAM (Random Access Memory) onto a temporary area of your 
    hard disk.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think  of  virtual memory as an alternate set of memory  addresses
(An address is a location of data,  usually in main memory or on a
disk.   You  can  think of computer memory as a group  of  storage
boxes,   each  of which is one byte in length.  Each  box  has  an
address - a unique number - assigned to it.).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  purpose  of  virtual memory is to enlarge the address  space,
the set of addresses a program can utilize.  For example,  virtual
memory might contain twice as many addresses as main memory.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Programs  use  these virtual addresses rather than real  addresses
to  store  instructions and data.  When the  program  is  actually
used,   or those particular instructions are needed,  the  virtual
addresses are copied into real memory addresses.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  virtual memory settings in Windows Me and 98 can be found  by
going  to the Control Panel and selecting the System Icon.   Click
the  Performance  Tab,  and click the Virtual Memory  button.   In
Windows  XP,   go  to  Control Panel,  click  on  Performance  and
Maintenance,  click on the System Icon. In the Performance Options
dialog box, click the Advanced tab.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's not a good idea to change these settings unless you 
    know exactly what you're doing!</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most  computers do a poor job of keeping time,  losing or  gaining
as  much as a couple of seconds a day.  That may not seem  like  a
big  deal,  but let it go on for a few months and it's  more  than
enough to put your PC's clock several minutes on the fast or  slow
side.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its  pretty  easy to adjust the clock:  double  click  on  it  and
you'll see a dialog box where you can make the necessary changes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windows  XP  users can solve this problem easily.   Simply  right-
click  the  clock  in  the  corner of the taskbar,   click  Adjust
Date/Time,   select  the   Internet   Time  tab,   and  check  the
Automatically synchronize with an Internet time server box.   When
your  computer  connects to the Internet,   it  will  periodically
check  in  with an atomic clock and make sure that  you  have  the
correct time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When  on the Internet, You seem to lose the connection frequently 
and then you have to sign back on again. Why does this  happen?  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you  have  call  waiting  and a call  comes  in,   this  could
interrupt your connection.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  can  disable  the call waiting option on your  computer  when
using  the modem.  You will need to check with your phone  company
to  find  out what your code is,  but usually it's something  that
starts with either * or # and then two numbers, usually #70.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To disable Call-Waiting, you'll have to access your sign-on 
    settings. This varies from program to program, depending on what you use to 
    access the Internet. This is done where you originally set up the phone numbers 
    for the computer to dial. Have your Internet dialup begin with #70 then the 
    phone number, for example #70555-1234.</P>  
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are using America Online, you can set up your sign-on 
    to automatically dial up to reconnect if the call is interrupted. Here's how:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.  On the Sign On screen, click Setup. On the Edit America Online
Setup window,  click Edit Numbers. 2. On the Edit Location window,
click Edit.  3.  On the Edit Number (Connection) window, click the
check  box  next   to   Automatically   reconnect  me  and  ignore
interruptions when using this connection.  4.  Click OK.  5. Click
Yes  when  prompted  to  change your reconnect  settings  for  all
numbers.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Click OK.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You  will  now be reconnected automatically whenever your  dial-up
connection is interrupted.</P>
