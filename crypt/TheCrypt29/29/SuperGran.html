<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An elderly Florida lady did her shopping, and upon returning to her car, found four males in the act of leaving with her vehicle.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She dropped her shopping bags and drew her handgun, proceeding to scream at the top of her voice, <B>"I have a gun and I know how to use it! Get out of the car!"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The four men didn't wait for a second invitation. They got out and ran as though they were possessed. The elderly lady, somewhat shaken, then proceeded to load her shopping bags into the back of the car and get into the drivers seat.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She was so shaken that she couldn't get her key into the ignition. She tried and tried, and then it dawned on her why. A few minutes later she found her own car parked four or five spaces down.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She loaded her bags into her car and then drove to the police station. The sergeant to whom she told the story nearly rolled in the floor with laughter.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He pointed to the other end of the counter, where four pale males were reporting a car jacking by a mad, elderly woman described as white, less than five feet tall, glasses, curly white hair, and carrying a large handgun.</P>
