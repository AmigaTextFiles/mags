<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A woman awakes during the night to find that her husband
is not in bed. She puts on her robe and goes downstairs to
look for him. She finds him sitting at the kitchen table
with a cup of coffee in front of him. He appears to be in
deep thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he
wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of his coffee.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>What's the matter, dear</B></I>?" she whispers as she steps into
the room, "<I><B>Why are you down here at this time of night</B></I>?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The husband looks up from his coffee. "<B>Do you remember 20
years ago when we were dating, and you were only 16?</B>" he
asks solemnly.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Yes I do</B></I>," she replies.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The husband pauses. The words are not coming easily. "<B>Do
you remember when your father caught us in the back seat
of my car?</B>"</P>

have gotten out today.</B>"</P>
