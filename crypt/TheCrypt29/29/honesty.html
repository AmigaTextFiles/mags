<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two old folks got married.  As they were laying in their wedding suite,
staring at the ceiling, the old man says, <B>"I haven't been completely
honest with you.&nbsp;  I think the world of you, but you are only number 
two to me.&nbsp; Golf is my first love.&nbsp; It's my hobby, my passion, my first 
love."</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They both stare at the ceiling for a bit then the woman said, <I><B>"While 
we're baring our souls, I guess I better tell you that I've  been a 
hooker all my life."</B></I></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The man jumps out of bed, looks at her a moment then says, <B>"Have you 
tried widening your stance and adjusting your grip?</B></P>
