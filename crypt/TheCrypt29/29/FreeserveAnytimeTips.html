  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having upgraded to FS Anytime from hometime a couple of weeks 
    ago, I got fed up with engaged tones, and searching the FS help pages gave 
    no alternative numbers - but in fact there are a good few, and I thought I'd 
    share how to get them <B>:o)</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If  you  use a PC - move on to the next message now - it's  of  no
consequence to you - you can just use the download.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OK.   Go to the FS help pages and find the link for the connection
kit.   Follow that link and you'll get a login screen where you'll
need  your FS login and password.  Once done,  follow the  initial
instructions to install.  At some point,  you'll get a  text  file
(<B>which  would be D/L and run on a PC</B>).  Scroll to  the  bottom  of
this file, and you'll find a line RUN=https://....</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Copy  the URL from this line and paste it into your URL box  (<B>It's
a link to a PC exe</B>) which should prompt a D/L of the file.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  a self extracting zip - which VoodooX (<B>and presumably Unarc</B>)
can  handle,   so  extract it all to RAM:  (<B>or anywhere  else  you
fancy</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now,   there should be four files extracted - 3 exes and  a  .dll.
Run  the exe's through a viewer (<B>the dopus built in one is  pretty
good,  but any hex reader that gives the ascii transalation should
do</B>),  and search for the phone numbers (<B>if your viewer supports  a
"Search"  function,  searching for "0808" should get  you  in  the
vicinity - they are all grouped together</B>),  then simply add  those
that begin (<B>1470</B>)0808 or (<B>1470</B>)161642 to your dialer.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>NB.</B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   There will be a few duplicated numbers in the various files,
so  ignore  the duplicates - and there will be at least  one  0845
number,   which  is  a  pay per minute number  (<B>used  as  a  final
fallback on the PC</B>) which you might also want to ignore.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now,   if  you  get an engaged tone,  you can use  an  alternative
number.   You might want to order the numbers so that the new  ones
are dialled first,  since they are likely to have less traffic  on
them.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I  know  no-one  asked,  but since I found it,  and  it's  a  huge
improvement over one number, I thought I'd share <B>:o)</B></P>
