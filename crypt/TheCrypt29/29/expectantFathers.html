<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three  men are sitting in the maternity ward of a hospital waiting
for  the  imminent birth of their respective children.   One's  an
Englishman,  one a Scotsman and the other a Jamaican. They are all
very nervous and pacing the floor.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All  of a sudden the doctor bursts through the double doors saying
"<I><B>Gentlemen  you  won't believe this but your wives  have  all  had
their babies within 5 minutes of each other.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The men are beside themselves with happiness and joy.  "<I><B>And</B></I>", said
the  doctor,   "<I><B>They have all had little boys.</B></I>"  The  fathers  are
ecstatic and congratulate each other over and over.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"  <I><B>However,  we do have one slight problem</B></I>," the doctor said.  "<I><B>In
all the confusion we may have mixed the babies up getting them  to
the  nursery and would be grateful if you could join us  there  to
try and help identify them.</B></I>"</P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">With that the Scotsman raced past the doctor and bolted to the 
nursery. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  inside  he  picked up a dark skinned infant with  dreadlocks
saying," <B>There's no doubt about it, this boy is mine!</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  doctor looked bewildered and said,  "<I><B>Well sir,   of  all  the
babies  I  would have thought that maybe this child  could  be  of
Jamaican descent.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>True</B>",  said the Scotsman,  "<B>but one of the other two is  f#*king
English and I'm not taking the risk</B></P>
