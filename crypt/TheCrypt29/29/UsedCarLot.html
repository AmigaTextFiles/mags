<CENTER>Caveat Emptor- let the buyer beware</CENTER>
<CENTER>Should be announced loudly on signs everywhere</CENTER>
<CENTER>Is this car a good deal, or is it not,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or is it a death-trap, filled full of rot?</CENTER>
<BR>

<CENTER>A nice little runner to go about town,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Or an old clapped out banger that will let you down?</CENTER>
<CENTER>A risk with each purchase the punter will take,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Get advice from a pro to avoid that mistake !</CENTER>
<BR>

<CENTER>Avoid Arthur Daleys and types just like that,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who would stop at nothing to skin an old cat.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And watch for the paintwork that doesn't seem right,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The back dull and lifeless, the front clean and bright.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>A magnet to check all the panels are well,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And not papier mache and rotted to hell.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Electrics that will work first time every time,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Stop you spending a dollar for every saved dime !</CENTER>
<BR>

<CENTER>Oil leaks on suspension, engine and gearbox found,</CENTER>
<CENTER>All clearly show you what's been run to the ground.</CENTER>
<CENTER>If these give-aways can be easily sought,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's high time somewhere else a vehicle be bought !</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>So be very cautious, I think you'll agree,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And take a quick hint from an old 'un like me.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And whilst I'm about it, insist you agree,</CENTER>
<CENTER>On a genuine car with a log book you see !</CENTER>
