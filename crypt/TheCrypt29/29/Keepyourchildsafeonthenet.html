<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet offers a tremendous amount of diversified information as well as 
communication with interesting people from all over the world.  Not all of 
it, however, is suitable for everyone.  Anyone with <B>children</B> or <B>grandchildren </B>
should be aware of the good and the bad on the Internet. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Use the Internet with your child. <B>Be involved</B> - get 
    to know the Internet and any services your child uses. If you don't know how 
    to log on, get your child to show you. Have your child show you what he or 
    she does on line, and become familiar with all the things that you can do 
    on line.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Learn about controls such as filtering software or AOL Parental 
    controls, where you can check and manage your child's activities on line.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Set rules for online behavior: <B>never give out personal information</B>, <B>don't 
talk to strangers</B>, <B>never send your picture to a stranger</B>.  Make sure your 
child tells you if someone or something online makes them feel uncomfortable. </P>
 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Put your child's computer in a family area of the house, and never in the 
child's room.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Be sure to report conduct or material that is offensive to your ISP; if it is 
threatening, report it to local Police. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Never</B> allow your child to arrange a <B>face-to-face</B> 
    meeting with another computer user without your permission beforehand. If 
    a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public place, and be sure to 
    accompany your child. Make sure your child tells you if he is asked to meet 
    someone off line.</P>
