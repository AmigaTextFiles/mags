  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This sign was prominently displayed in the window of a business in
  Philadelphia. You are probably outraged at the thought of such an
  inflammatory statement. One would think that anti-hate groups from
  all across the country would be marching on this business... And that
  the National Guard might have to be called to keep the angry crowds
  back. But, perhaps in these stressful times one might be tempted to
  let the proprietors simply make their statement . . . We are a
  society who holds Freedom of Speech as perhaps our greatest liberty</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">. . . And after all, it is just a sign. You may ask what kind of
  business would dare post such a sign?</P>
