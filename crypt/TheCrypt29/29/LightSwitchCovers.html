<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We remodeled our bathroom recently and when it was time to choose 
our switch plate covers, we were overwhelmed with the variety and 
prices of them. We wanted out-of-the-ordinary light switch covers but 
didn't want to pay the price -- and besides, we couldn't find any that 
matched our decor out of all that variety!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what we did was purchase plain, unfinished wood, switch and outlet 
covers and I painted them to match our decor. We did our bathroom 
decor in jewel tone colors with brass accents so I decided to paint the 
light switch covers in dark blue with gold stars. We love the `custom 
homemade' look of the covers and it was very easy to accomplish. 
<B>Below you'll find step-by-step instructions for how to do this.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before beginning this project, decide on the color and design of your 
covers. Try to include colors and design elements that are already in 
the room then go purchase your materials.</P>

<B>Instructions:</B><BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Prepare a work surface by laying newspaper down on a large area 
then...</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>1.</B>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLACK> Base coat the cover with the color of your choice. You will probably 
need at least a second coat, maybe a third. Let each coat dry before 
applying the next.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>2.</B>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLACK> Stamp on your design. First, plan your design, then practice 
stamping. To do this, using a small paintbrush, paint the acrylic paint 
onto the stamp then press onto paper firmly but being careful not to turn 
it to get a smudge. Once you are comfortable with the feel of it, then go 
ahead and stamp your design onto the base-painted switch cover.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>3.</B>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=BLACK> If desired spray with clear acrylic for protection and easy cleaning. 
This is best done outside on a piece of cardboard or newspaper. Let dry 
then put the covers on as usual <B>(a good job for hubby)</B>.
There are many other ways you can decorate these;&nbsp; sponge paint 
them, paint on free-hand designs, decoupage or whatever else may 
inspire you. This is just one idea to get your imagination going. Have 
fun with it.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
