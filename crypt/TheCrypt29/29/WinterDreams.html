<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">January is here in full force in the eastern part of the country
and from what I hear, in most of the United States. I live in
Virginia and today the high temp was 7 degrees. The wind chill
was below zero. I feel very blessed to have a warm home and the
means to keep my beloved family and pets warm and fed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking out the window, I see the bare garden and the snow all
over the ground. The trees bend and bow with the wind and my
thoughts turn to spring. I was so excited last week when the mail
came and low and behold, there were gardening catalogs there,
just for me.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take out pen and paper and start to figure what I will plant
once the frosty snow and ice is gone and how beautiful my garden
will be. I will of course, not make the same mistakes and things
will be even better than last year.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I love the flowers, veggies and fruits I see on all these
wonderful pages. I circle them and make notes. I remember the
beautiful daffodils and crocus that peak out before the chill is
even gone from the air. They must be as anxious as we are to see
Spring.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I admit, I love the first snow and the way Mother Earth looks
with the ice all about. I take tons of pictures and enjoy
watching the winter birds flock to the feeders.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had some mild winters over the last few years and I feel
that nature heard too many people bragging or complaining and
gave them what they wanted, a winter to remember.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard that the temperatures hit the lowest in history for our
area today. I am not surprised at all. We have the woodstove
stoked up and the wood stacked high, and we are toasty, now as
long as the wind leaves the electricity alone. Shhhhhh.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even as I write this, I hear the wind howling and the tree limbs
rubbing on my roof, which means they are really being blown
around quite a lot.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have plenty of candles, canned foods, water and blankets, but
life just isn't what it used to be when we were kids and this was
all fun and cool. Now we have to somehow keep pipes from freezing
and keep everyone warm and safe. <B>Pets included.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So of course, those seed catalogs and magazines heralding Spring,
look so nice. I have had enough of winter already. I do feel a
certain furry friend will see his shadow yet again this year, and
regardless we will have quite a bit more cold weather.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But alas, I still have my catalogs, the fire, hot chocolate and
luckily I don't have anywhere to go for awhile. I am seeing herbs
and veggies, flowers and bulbs dancing in my head.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Remember, February is just around the corner and I saw in the
Farmer's Almanac only 56 days until Spring!</P>
