<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using leftovers not only saves money by using up foods that you have 
on hand, therefore decreasing shopping trips, but it can also save time. 
The most obvious way you can save time using leftovers is that the dish 
is already cooked and all you have to do is warm it up the next evening 
for a meal. This, however, can get boring.  Another, more exciting way 
to use leftovers is to <B>plan your leftovers.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To plan your leftovers means to plan on cooking more of something in 
your current meal to use for an upcoming planned meal. For example, if 
you are having roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, and roasted 
vegetables for dinner tonight, you could plan on cooking double the 
amount of roast beef that your family normally eats so you can use the 
extra in tomorrow night's dinner which is planned to be open faced, hot 
roast beef sandwiches and green salad. You could even go the extra 
length and make double the amount of mashed potatoes and roasted 
vegetables to make potato pancakes and pasta salad with sliced 
roasted vegetables to go with the open faced hot roast beef 
sandwiches. You would have most of your upcoming meal already 
prepared for you. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, this takes a little time to plan, but cooking this way will save 
you a lot more time than what it took to plan it and as a bonus, you'll 
be saving oodles of money! Planning will ensure that you have the right 
ingredients on hand for your planned meals.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To plan your leftovers, you just need to think about the way you use 
your leftovers. You could sit down with a notebook and pen and write 
down all the ways in which you use leftovers and add to it when you find 
new ideas. Make a few pages for each different type of leftover such as 
<B>'chicken', 'beef', 'potatoes', 'bread', 'vegetables', 'pasta',</B> etc.  If you'd 
like 
to skip this part or need more ideas for what to do with your leftovers, 
check out my e-book The Leftover Recipe E-book here:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have written down all the ways you use leftovers, you can 
then plan your meals for the week in either your notebook (this is a 
great idea because you can use it over and over again) or on a 
calendar. Say you want to have chili and cornbread this week. Plan on 
making a double batch of chili to use the next night for chili dogs (or 
maybe even a triple batch so family members can use some for 
lunches). Once you have your menu planned, then you'll need to make 
a shopping list to ensure you have all ingredients needed. </P>
