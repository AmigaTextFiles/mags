me crazy, and we had no money in our pockets (or anywhere else).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When I slammed our front door, I knocked the only plant I had 
managed to keep alive all season off the windowsill. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just as the pottery hit the floor and cracked, so did I. I lay face 
down in black potting soil and pottery shards and let my Labrador 
lick the tears off my dirty face.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That was just before the birth of our first child. Since 
then, there have been countless times when I've wanted to 
curl up on the carpet and bawl, but the ever-watching kids 
have made that a luxury I can no longer afford. Now that I 
have a two-year-old, I have to struggle to not act like one. 
I have to keep my temper under control.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's more difficult now, too. One of the biggest surprises 
of motherhood, many moms agree, is the absolute anger we 
can feel in no time - and with very little provocation. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Start with a sleep-deprived parent, throw in a troubled 
teenager, a whining child, or a colicky newborn, add some graphic 
TV news coverage, and even the coolest cat may lose her mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Releasing our anger in the wrong ways can lead to emotional 
and physical scars on our kids. When infants are shaken, 
even for one heated moment, they can die. And it takes only 
a moment to harm their little souls. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Weeks ago, I snapped at my two-year-old. It was an instance 
that I thought would be forgotten after a hug and an apology. 
Until, that is, the next day when she kept asking, 
<B>"Mommy, are you mad at me?"</B> Even today, she can sense 
irritation in just the set of my jaw and she'll ask again. 
It breaks my heart to know she must remember when mommy was mad. 
It proves how sensitive and impressionable she is and how she is 
always, always watching her mommy.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As they watch, these young ones are paying particular 
attention to the way we handle difficult situations. And 
what we model for them will, in large part, determine their 
success at controlling their own tempers as they grow up.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, even in the face of total exasperation, we must stay 
calm. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For a long time, the advice has been to simply go 
away for a moment and count to ten, but, as all moms know, 
sometimes that's not so easy. A small child may be 
frightened when mommy leaves to take a time-out. Sometimes 
counting to ten just doesn't do it, and there's no time 
to count to 100.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So here are a few more tips, compiled just for moms, to 
help you deal with anger and stay calm with your kids.</P>

<B>*Declare a zero-tolerance policy on the out-of-control temper.*</B><BR>
You must decide, for yourself, that behaving this way is 
simply not okay. Remind yourself that it is possible to manage 
your emotions. Think back to times when you were successful at 
controlling your anger. Perhaps you bit your tongue rather 
than hollering at the boss. Or you were just about to let it 
fly at your husband when your in-laws called and suddenly you 
couldn't believe the sweetness of your own voice. See? We all 
have the power to suddenly change our mood.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Be prepared.*</B> <BR>
Lots of things can go wrong each day; be ready 
for them. For example, if you've got babies, pack a bag with at 
least one extra shirt for everyone (<B>even Dad</B>), a complete outfit 
for each toddler, and several for the infants. Stow them in the 
back of the car with extra diapers and plenty of baby wipes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Is there anything specific that triggers your anger?*</B><BR>
Keep a journal for those times when you feel like you're ready to 
fly off the handle. Do you notice any patterns--time of day,
hunger level, lack of exercise, a full calendar? Even noise 
from a TV or radio can contribute to a feeling of over-stimulation,
which can set off an emotional explosion. Create a nurturing 
environment for yourself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Take care of yourself.*</B><BR>
 We're more likely to react to a situation 
- rather than to simply act - when we haven't gotten enough 
sleep or we haven't been eating right. Start your day with a light 
breakfast that includes carbohydrates and protein. Then continue 
to eat for energy throughout the day. More Energy for Moms 
(http://www.momscape.com/energy ) features information on 
how to control your moods with food.<BR> 
<BR>
<B>*Daily exercise*</B> <BR>
provides a physical release to help you control 
anxiety and aggression throughout the day. A half-hour of 
kickboxing can release tension you didn't even know you had. 
I know I'm not the only mom addicted to Tae-Bo tapes. We 
kick and punch our way back to sanity every afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*A regular routine of prayer and meditation*</B><BR>
 can calm a chaotic 
mind. Sit quietly for at least 15 minutes a day. Practice a 
few yoga stretches when things get tense.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Decide how you'll deal with certain situation before they arise.*</B><BR>
What makes you want to blow your top? Whether it's toddler temper 
tantrums or the preschooler's occasional whine, determine how you 
will handle those things beforehand - while you're calm.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Understand your child.*</B><BR>
 Read up on child development and put 
yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself: "What's it like to be 
two and not have the skills to express what you want?" "What's 
it like for a newborn who finds herself with a gut-wrenching 
bellyful of gas and doesn't understand why it hurts?" Kids 
act the way they do for a reason. Often, there's a developmental 
milestone associated with a child's behavior. Understanding the 
reasons behind our kids' actions can go a long way in helping 
us develop a sense of empathy, compassion and, ultimately, 
tolerance.<BR>

<B>*Take a few deep breaths.*</B><BR> 
Diaphragmatic breathing helps reduce 
stress. This will also give you a time-out, long enough to make 
a rational assessment of the situation and to help you regain a 
sense of control.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Visualize*</B><BR>
 yourself as the cool, calm, person you strive to be. 
Whom do you know who embodies these traits? Imagine this person's 
reaction to the situation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Stop. Think. Then speak.*</B><BR>
 Remind yourself of the importance of 
keeping yourself under control. If you feel anger building inside, 
don't pick up a baby. Ask for help or wait until you are calm.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Consciously lower your voice.*</B><BR>
 Yelling will only make a child 
angry and defensive, and it can scare a young child. A soft 
tone says you're in control.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Don't catastrophize.*</B><BR> 
Resist the temptation to blow something 
out of proportion. Avoid using the words "always" and "never" 
when you talk to yourself and when you talk to other people.<BR>
<BR>
<B>*Distract yourself.*</B><BR>
 Is there any way you can laugh about the 
situation? Ask yourself: what is the real significance of the 
situation that triggered your rage? It's more important to 
model a healthy approach to stress than it is to win certain 
battles. Choose those battles carefully.<BR>
<BR>
Afterwards, reinforce your love for the child and retreat to 
assess the way you handled the situation. What did you do 
right? What will you do differently next time?<BR>
