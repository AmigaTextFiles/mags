<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only  6mm thick and small enough to slip into any wallet or  purse
alongside  your  bank  and credit cards,   this  advanced  compact
digital camera is the business.  Carry it with you everywhere  and
capture the moments other cameras miss.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  couldn't be easier to use.  Just switch the power on,  frame
your  shot  through the optical viewfinder and  click  -  it's  as
simple as that.  Unlike many other digital cameras,  this  is  one
model you don't need a degree in astrophysics to use!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's  8MB  internal memory will hold up to 101 320x240 photographs
or  26  larger shots of 640x480.  Manufacturer Oregon Scientific's
unique  automatic   brightness   adaptive   technology  Autobrite,
meanwhile,   ensures that the bright regions  of  an  image  never
saturate and that the darker details are always crisp and clear.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What  that  adds up to is sharp images perfect for  dropping  into
business  documents,  files or presentations.   Just  connect  the
camera to your Windows or Macintosh computer's USB port,  download
the  photos via the included software and they're ready  to  email
to friends or publish on the web immediately.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  CardCam  comes complete with protective wallet,  strap,   USB
cable  and  all  the   software   you'll   need.   Fitted  with  a
rechargeable battery,  it takes just two hours to power  the  unit
up by connecting it to your computer.</P>
