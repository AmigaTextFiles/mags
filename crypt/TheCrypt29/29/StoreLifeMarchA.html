  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>The Convenience Store</B> - the corner shop. Everyone's 
    got one, quite local to them, usually on the corner of the road. Always there, 
    always open, except when you run out of milk at 2am or the cat's just come 
    in and wants feeding -- then they're closed. We take them for granted, and 
    then moan when they close down because the new supermarket that opened recently 
    that's about 2 miles away, has taken all the custom, and they can't afford 
    to compete and stay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's not easy to run a little corner shop - ask anyone who's tried it, and they'll tell 
you all about it.  I know, I manage one.  Let me give you an example of a typical 
working day.  Do I hear you say "<B>That's boring</B>"?  Not likely.  Just try this for size.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shop is open from 7am until 10pm at night, every day, 
    seven days a week, all year 'round. There's no rest for the wicked - just 
    that I'd like the opportunity to be wicked once in a while. <FONT COLOR=BLUE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, we have been dragged kicking and screaming into the age of computer 
run stores.  Whilst this will eventually lead to easier running of the store, it has not 
been without mishap, generating a few laughs on the way.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had an upgrade to the office computer with new software 
    and an increase in memory, and everything is done with a hand held scanner 
    which is downloaded to the main computer. It should be quicker, but has led 
    to a substantial drain on time due to its age. When I first started working 
    at this store, the scanner was only used once a week to check prices. Scan 
    the barcode of an item, input the price on the shelf label and download all 
    the information to the main computer. The main computer would check prices 
    against its database, reporting any anomalies, and correct anything wrong. 
    Over a period of three months, the whole shop would be covered this way.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last nine months, this poor little scanner has been 
    in constant use, checking in deliveries, ordering stock, price checking and 
    counting stock. It's now either dying or taking strike action! The Enter button 
    sticks, resulting in a frantic beeping from the unit, and constant error messages; 
    the battery, which used to last all day without a recharge, lasts around 20 
    minutes, and it's now developed amnesia. We have been told we will have new 
    hardware to work with, but, as this is only one store among 300, and also 
    the smallest, we will probably be the last to get one. This has been the case 
    so far.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These upgrades have been received with trepidation among staff members from all 
stores, not just ours.  With promises that the new methods will speed up the 
processing of information, it takes a while for some to understand how to operate 
the scanner to achieve the results required.  At times, it feels similar to wading 
through treacle - an awful lot of effort and no headway.  It certainly sorts out the 
timid and nervous.  It can also generate some interesting stock reads!  Luckily, they 
can still be modified by hand, if you spot them.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an experiment being run now, comparing stock results done in store with 
the scanner, with the stock reports from the external stock takers to see if the results 
are comparable.  In correct use, the stock level reported by the computer should be 
more accurate, as external stock taking takes place during trading hours, and items 
counted are being sold.  They also admit that "educated guesses" have to be made 
for commodities like crisps, chocolate bars, etc., whereas we count each individual 
item, which is very time consuming. For best results, counting is carried out during 
quiet trading hours, so little stock is sold through, affecting the total.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are, at present, around 60 percent complete with the itemised count, with 
another four weeks to completion.  After this, we start anew, noting which items 
throw up a discrepancy - meaning these have been either stolen or short supplied.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, using old equipment for new methods causes problems. 
    Twice this week whilst making an order, the scanner has "lost its memory", 
    resulting in frantic telephone calls, first to Scanning Help and then Technical 
    Support for assistance. It has happened to the same supervisor on both occasions, 
    which is unfortunate as she thinks the scanner doesn't like her! On the last 
    occasion, the Technical Support team member tried to rush things a little 
    too quickly, and the reload of the scanner was incomplete, resulting in a 
    panic call for me to make a manual order, as she did not know how to make 
    one. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A reload was tried first, which was successful, and highlighted 
    the error from Technical Support. The I.T. team are totally competent within 
    their field, but can tie people in knots when describing activities via the 
    telephone! When the staff member is not that computer friendly, this can cause 
    untold mayhem and panic. So, an order which could have taken over an hour 
    by hand was done within twenty minutes. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all knew there would be a few teething problems with this new system, but 
panic phone calls I personally could do without, especially when I'm on holiday - 
again!  </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together with all this, we have a new system and software 
    for e-mails, and a new Intranet service, which, although we were told was 
    a "closed" system, we have discovered is not. I have been able to access it 
    at home; true, you need to know your password to gain access to all the information, 
    and I ducked out of continuing. I can see horrible things happening soon.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New technology is all very exciting and promises to make things much easier, but 
as always will come at a cost, in time and patience as well as cash.  Hopefully, it 
should generate a few laughs along the way.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all tease and swap jokes at work;  work proceeds quicker when we're having 
fun, and new staff members are soon put at ease within the team.  Unlike some 
managers, I realise that retail work can be very mundane, thankless, and frustrating, 
so I muck in and am just a regular team member.  They are all happy to leave 
major decisions to me and to do the more difficult chores, but normally there is 
nothing to distinguish my role within the shop from any other member of staff.  
We pride ourselves on a job done well and having fun at the same time.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other managers have different ideas, as was recently demonstrated in another store.  
Newly opened in a purpose built building, with an experienced manager in an area 
with no competition, it was expected to achieve excellent figures and prosper.  Two 
of my staff members were sent to assist on opening day, to train the new staff, and 
help serve when it became busy.  The first day went extremely well, and everyone 
was confident the store would go from strength to strength.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To everyone's surprise, within less than a month, the store was ailing, with staff 
resigning, poor figures and dis-satisfied customers.  How could things have gone so 
horribly wrong?  Our Area Manager was sent to investigate, and within an hour was 
frantically telephoning for assistance.  Two members of my staff volunteered at 
short notice, and were whisked 25 miles away to lend a hand.  They were 
astounded by how the store had changed.  The following day, I was given their 
report, and it was not good. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the manager was experienced, it seemed they had become 
    accustomed to allowing the staff to work unsupervised while the manager stayed 
    in the office. Our type of stores cannot be run successfully this way, and 
    the staff morale dropped, due to lack of communication, training and support. 
    Lack of trust from the manager towards the staff developed, and became reciprocated. 
    Disenchanted staff were leaving, others were dismissed by the manager, and 
    sales dropped. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, a temporary manager was sought, and further staff recruited.  
Chaos reigned for a further month, but I'm happy to say, under the new manager, 
things have improved substantially.  She has a similar approach to mine, preferring 
to work alongside people and develop a team spirit, and order has now been 
established, with the sales climbing again, with more regular customers than before. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It proves that having a cheerful, caring attitude can work wonders, not just for the 
staff, but also for the whole community. I am certain now, with the team 
developing as it should, even if the manager moves on, the store will continue to 
grow and thrive. </P> 

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is all from me this time, I'm going to help unpack this 
    delivery. Besides, I've just heard a new joke, and I've just got to share 
    it. 'Bye, till next time.</P>
