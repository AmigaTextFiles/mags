<CENTER>It's Sunday, and bath-time, the neighbours can tell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As our youngest offspring starts to rant and yell,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You'd think sheer murder was being done within,</CENTER>
<CENTER>By the volume of noise; a remarkable din !</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>When mixed, dirt and water, he'll gladly attract,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But he's not keen on soap, and that is a fact,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The bathroom looks like a hurricane's been through,</CENTER>
<CENTER>It's one heck of a hassle, I can assure you !</CENTER>

<CENTER>Like a bucking bronco he dodges about,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Until he's in the tub, then you can't get him out,</CENTER>
<CENTER>To get some dirt off him was our simple ploy,</CENTER>
<CENTER>~Till he's finally out, and....  <B>we've got the wrong boy !</B></CENTER>
