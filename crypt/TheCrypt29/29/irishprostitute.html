<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A young Irish woman went to London to work as a secretary and began 
sending home money and gifts to her parents. After a few years they 
asked her to come home for a visit, as her father was getting frail and 
elderly. </P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She pulled up to the family home in a Rolls Royce and stepped out 
wearing furs and diamonds. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As she walked into the house her father said "<I><B>Hmmm - they seem  to
be  paying secretaries awfully well in London.</B></I>" The daughter  took
his  hands and said "<B>Dad - I've been meaning to tell you something
for  years but I didn't want to put it in a letter.  I can't  hide
it from you any longer. I've become a prostitute.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her father gasped,  put his hand on his heart and keeled over. The
doctor  was called but the old man had clearly lost  the  will  to
live. He was put to bed and the priest was called.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  the  priest  began  to  administer the  sacrament  of  extreme
unction,  with the mother and daughter weeping and wail!ing, the
old  man muttered weakly "<I><B>I'm a goner --killed by my own daughter!
Killed  by  the shame of what you've become!</B></I>"</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>&quot;Please forgive me</B>", his daughter sobbed, "<B>I 
    only wanted to have nice things! I wanted to be able to send you money and 
    the only way I could do it was by becoming a prostitute.</B>"</P>
 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pushing  the priest aside,  the old man sat bolt upright  in  bed,
smiling.   "<I><B>Did  you   say   prostitute?....I   thought  you  said
PROTESTANT!!</B></I>"</P>
