 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The BullShit detector comes in two parts: A sleek silver box about the
size of a packet of cigarettes fitted with flashing LEDs, and an
extremely powerful, crystal-clear loudspeaker. Accompanying this is a
remote control that will work through walls or up to 30 metres in the
open.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pressing a button on the remote control sets off one of a series of loud
BS warning messages on the detector. Fortunately, it is fitted with a
volume control.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We've tested the BS detector in a series of different scenarios. Each
time it's come out tops and taken the wind out of 99% of all known
bullshitters.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We asked the man who believes he understands everything to check out our
latest gadget. Of course he knew what it was immediately, some sort of
lie detector. He also knew how to fool it by fixing the pitch of his
voice. Switching it on, he watched as the lights flashed, checking his
speech patterns, or so he believed. Then we asked him a few straight
questions - his name, address and so on. The BS detector stayed silent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We explained that a superimposed harmonic frequency is detected by the
BS detector's audio input capture circuitry. After capturing the audio
input, the detector processes the input with dual digital signal
processors, coupled to an analogue to digital converter with a
contiguous voltage integrator.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you understand? we asked. Yes, he replied. The BS Detector's siren
went off. "Warning, warning, there's a bullshitter around here!" Mr
Know-It-All really believes he's been found out.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of our female gadget testers enjoy an occasional sherry. But
they're not necessarily that keen on attention from less-attractive male
specimens.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On our test night a lecherous lothario sidled up to Tracy: <B>"<I>Did you hurt
yourself when you fell from heaven</I>?"</B> He beat a hasty retreat as a voice
boomed from her handbag: <B>"Excuse me, can you please turn around? I can
barely hear you when you're talking out of your ass!"</B></P>
