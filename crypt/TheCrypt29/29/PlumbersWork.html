<CENTER>A frantic phone call early on in the day,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Announces "Our water is going astray !"</CENTER>
<CENTER>"We'll be a short while, before we can come over,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Have you painted the walls like the white cliffs of Dover?"</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER>We arrive shortly after to observe the scene,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A sample of panic, like none there has been,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Oh, help!" says the lady in a soaking wet frock,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"Madam, it would help to turn off the stop-cock!"</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>We survey the damage with a highly trained eye,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And move to one side, as a sofa floats by,</CENTER>
<CENTER>The flow of the water is finally abated,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"It's time for a tea break" my mate quickly stated.</CENTER>

<CENTER>With crowbar and blowtorch, a repair to do,</CENTER>
<CENTER>We paddled around until we found a clue,</CENTER>
<CENTER>A nail in a wall with a large hole around,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Conclusion - the leak we have certainly found.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>A compression collar is rapidly fitted,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As back and forth the housewife she flitted,</CENTER>
<CENTER>"A nice cup of tea, boys; before you depart?"</CENTER>
<CENTER>Felt like saying <B>"No water!"</B>, but did not have the heart.</CENTER>
