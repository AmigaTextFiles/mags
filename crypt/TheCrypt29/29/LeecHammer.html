<p>Most folk online use some type of P2P software. </p>
<p>They use them to download media in all types of format, whether it be mp3’s, 
  movies or software.</p>
  <p>One of the things that can irk users of this type of software is the people 
    known as leeches. That's folk who download from you, but don't either have 
    any files themselves or try to prevent anyone from uploading from them so 
    as to maximise their connection.</p>
  <p>I tried out one of the (many) programs that try to help eliminate these people…</p>
<p>            I looked for a program that worked with WinMX, which I have found 
  to be reasonably stable and have lots of files.</p>
<p>The programs I found were the likes of MXMonitor and LeecHammer.</p>
<p>LeecHammer can be found at <a
href="http://www.smartgamez.org/index.html">http://www.smartgamez.org/index.html</a></p>
<p>This program is still being developed and the latest version (at time of writing) 
  was version 1.1 which was released on 2.3.2003.</p>
<p>Ok, some quick pix to show the installation process.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=436 height=248
src="Images/leechammer03.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p>It is pretty standard fare……….</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=513 height=268
src="Images/leechammer04.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
  <p>You can, of course, decide where to put it. It doesn't depend on where WinMX 
    is installed……………..</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=370 height=378
src="Images/leechammer05.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Again, decide where the start point is…</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=277 height=100
src="Images/leechammer06.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>Ta-Dahl!!</p>
  <p>Ahh, you may think you're finished at this point, but LeecHammer is very 
    nice to you; it even helps you set up its functions…as shown.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=463 height=394
src="Images/leechammer07.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"> </p>
  <p>Now we come to the good part </p>
<p>Here comes “Hammer time”…hehehehehehe.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=463 height=394
src="Images/leechammer08.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"> </p>
  <p>This is one of the most important parts; decide how many files it will take 
    before they're branded a leech. As you can see, I'm fairly lenient on them.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=463 height=394
src="Images/leechammer09.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032"> </p>
<p>LeecHammer also allows you to manipulate your queue, in various ways.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=463 height=394
src="Images/leechammer10.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"> </p>
  <p>Leeches beware!…Hammer time again!</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=463 height=394
src="Images/leechammer11.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"> </p>
<p>There you go, no pain at all.</p>
  <p>However, the story doesn't stop there; LeecHammer has a lot more that you 
    can tweak. Again, its easier if I just show you the grabs…………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer12.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"> </p>
  <p>This is the normal view of LeecHammer. You can click the “less info” button 
    and it keeps only the two rows of buttons. Why would you? Well, if you have 
    it set up properly (or to your liking), why not just minimise it? As you will 
    see in the following grabs, minimising it will send it to the system tray.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer13.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"> </p>
  <p>Back into the settings tab, and we go over what we decided on the original 
    set-up -- but with a few new wrinkles.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer14.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"> </p>
<p>Not only can we “hammer” leeches, but also we can reward other users we like…</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer15.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"> </p>
  <p>LeecHammer also sets up your MX connection. This is the only point that I 
    don't like. I have a 56k modem (many thanks again, BT), and LeecHammer only 
    lets me keep a minimum of two slots open. Without it running, I can keep this 
    to one…much better for a modem user. However, you can leave this option unchecked 
    to prevent this.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer16.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"> </p>
<p>You can even add new sounds ………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer17.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"> </p>
  <p>Another way to hammer folk is those who decide that everyone has a T1 connection 
    and lump 50 requests into your queue. You may have noticed that MX doesn’t 
    care how many uploads of pictures it can take to make your modem crawl.</p>
<p>This, happily, brings the power back to you.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer18.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1041"> </p>
<p>Leeches can be quite devious sometimes, and this option has a check for them 
  as well.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer19.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1042"> </p>
  <p>Never lose sight of the folk you want to track -- well for two hours anyway.</p>
<p>People who can stop your whois can be rejected as well.</p>
  <p>Nice program, isn't it?</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer20.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1043"> </p>
  <p>And finally, for the settings anyway, here's where you can decide to start 
    Mx from LeecHammer, which always saves you starting two programs. It also 
    allows you that option of the system tray that I mentioned earlier.</p>
  <p>I notice I haven't mentioned the second row of buttons at the top. You can 
    stop LeecHammer by using the Stop button appropriately………</p>
  <p>There's a Check now function, just in case you've got the check feature set 
    to a large value instead of the default 30 seconds. The MX button starts MX, 
    in case you haven't selected to do so in the settings, and the last one is 
    the help function, which takes you to the help pages and the FAQ. Fix focus 
    is to help with one of the author's little niggles. Now and again, WinMX and 
    LeecHammer will come to the fore, clicking this button will try to maintain 
    LeecHammer at the front. The author mentions another flaw, which is the memory 
    fragmentation problem that the program has. He's working on it, but he says 
    that rebooting once a day should prevent it happening. I suppose if I had 
    an always-on connection, this might worry me…</p>
<p>Ok, that covers the settings; so how well does it work?</p>
  <p>Very well, thank you. I love hearing the noise that the program makes when 
    it gets rid of another leech </p>
  <p>The program is stable enough and I haven't had any problems using it. </p>
<p>Besides the fact that it handles leeches and generally helps you mange your 
  queue, it also has the “stats”.</p>
<p>Some more grabs are in order, I believe.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer21.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1044"> </p>
  <p>As you can see, this was grabbed at the beginning of a session. LeecHammer 
    hadn't found many leeches…or maybe I was lucky. </p>
  <p>It also lets you see how many files are on offer, an average of 603. Not 
    bad!</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer22.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1045"> </p>
  <p>All those gits with a fast connection…T3's as well, lucky bar stewards!!!</p>
<p>And finally………</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=405 height=453
src="Images/leechammer23.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1046"> </p>
</center>
<p>Hmm, must be those ADSL users, with all those slots.</p>
<p>Right, hope this gives a flavour for LeecHammer. I'm sure this is going to 
  stay on my drive. Makes my using WinMX much better -- and, so far, no drawbacks.</p>
<p>Can't say much fairer than that, and, of course, its free.</p>
<p>The author has a donation part on his website, and if you feel it warrants 
  it, give him some dough to help keep the wolf from the door.</p>
<p>If you use WinMX, give this a try and see for yourself how many leeches are 
  around!</p>
<p>Either that or track down MXMonitor (lots of folk have, by their sigs), but 
  its still in beta, albeit in use by many. Documentation on it is quite small 
  and in foreign languages, but it can be found, downloaded and run. I have tried 
  it, but prefer LeecHammer. </p>
