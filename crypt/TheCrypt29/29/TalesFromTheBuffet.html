<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regular readers of this feature will know that these pages
normally contain amusing, but true tales of my experiences working
as a steward for British Rail Train catering. A little bit
different this time around, as two events were about to change my
whole career, indeed my whole life!</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortly after starting work with Train catering, I had also 
    got married. Now the early years of marriage are normally quite good, with 
    both partners working at their individual jobs and contributing to the every 
    day household expenses. For me this was ideal, The wages paid to Stewards/Chief 
    Stewards in the winter season was barely sufficient for one person to live 
    on, never mind a married couple ( <I>Slightly different in the height of the 
    Summer season with all the tourist trade, but as I say it is a short Summer 
    and a very long Winter</I>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning home from a trip to Aberdeen, my wife had some exciting
news for me. She had been at the Doctors, <B>YES</B> ...She was pregnant.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now this was very GOOD news, the imminent birth of my first child,
I was going to be a father .... however it did not take long before
reality set in ... and I realised that the wages from my
employment would certainly not cover our expenses, when my wife
gave up her job ...and with an extra mouth to feed .. well the
situation seemed impossible.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In normal circumstances this would not really have been a problem.
I was, after all a skilled tradesman, having served a full
apprenticeship as a fitter Welder, Inverness was at the height of
the Oil boom and work for Welders was not only plentiful, but also
very well paid.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My problem was ...I had found a job that I really loved, There 
    was a sense of freedom, but also of Family in working with British Rail, never 
    before had I felt so happy or fulfilled as I had while working with Train 
    catering.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very difficult to explain in words to anyone not involved
with the Railway, but it does seem to envelope you into a
tight knit group, even of holidays or time off, your life revolves
around the nearest Train station and or the staff therein.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This might sound to you like an obsession, and I suppose in some
ways it is, but don't mistake it for hobbiests like Train Spotters
or the rail enthusiasts, Very few people working for British Rail
are spotters or enthusiasts, but almost all seem to develop this
Railway family feeling.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway the thought that due to circumstances, I would probably
have to give up my career with the Railway, and return to my
original trade, was, for me soul destroying, but I could see no
other alternative.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day while standing Spare at Inverness station, Bill Pollock
(Area Manager for Travellers Fare) stuck his head out of his
office door and gave me a shout.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Ian ...Grab two coffee's and come into my office"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing unusual in that, Mr. Pollock was famed for being a coffee
drinker and sitting for an hour at a time, telling tales of the olden
days and staff involved with train or station catering.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people rejected Bill Pollock as an old story teller, and a
bit of a laugh, but I knew that Mr. Pollock was a very tricky
customer, sharp and astute, with a very uncanny knack of getting
to the truth of a matter, without the other person being even
aware he/she was being questioned.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So having sat down and drank a couple of cups of coffee with Mr.
Pollock ...Chatted about old times etc. He suddenly tuned around
and said.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"You have been a bit down lately ... What's the Problem?"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">NOTE:- a statement and a Question. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was typical of Bill Pollock, he would get you relaxes 
    with stories and tales, and just at the right moment hit you right between 
    the eyes with the real reason he wanted to talk to you.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This took me quite by surprise even although I had expected it, I
suppose it would have been easy enough to say nothing was wrong,
but the look on Mr. Pollock's face, Told me that he had already a
good idea for what my answer was going to be.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After explaining my financial concerns and the unhappiness that I
may have to leave my beloved job, Bill just nodded and then said
he had to get back to work ...Virtually throwing me out of his
office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I really don't know what I expected, but after leaving his office,
I felt even more depressed than ever.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More that a month had passed and no further mention was made 
    about my conversation with Mr. Pollock, I had even started to apply for various 
    jobs, even though I tried to make light of it, I was deeply disturbed about 
    leaving the Railway.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One morning I was again assigned to "Spare" duty, and upon my
arrival at Inverness station (05.30am) I was soon warned that
several "Catering Management officials" were on the sleeping cars
from Glasgow.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the morning progressed Mr. Graham (Circuit Group Manager - Train
Catering) visited several catering vehicles, and did inspections
prior to their departure. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from a few curt words with Mr. Graham, I kept my distance
from the Station Cafeteria (out of sight - Out of mind).</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However just before my shift was due to finish, I was sitting 
    in the Cafeteria having a Coffee, when one of the Workers approached me, Saying 
    Bill Pollock wanted to see me in his office.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wandered along and gave a curtious knock on the Office 
    door and heard Bill bellow, "<B>Enter</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On opening the door and stepping inside the office, my heart fell
to my boots ... Sitting there was</P>

Bill Pollock (Area Manager Station catering - Inverness/Aberdeen)<BR>
Mr. W Graham (Circuit Group Manager - Train Catering)<BR>
Mr. J Thomsom (Personal manager Train/Station Catering)<BR>
Mr. W Langham (Group Catering manager - Scotland)<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now to a simple Chief Steward, to be called to see one on these
gentlemen would almost ensure a Bollocking for some reason or
another.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To be called to see 2 of them would almost ensure a sacking
offence.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To be called in to see 4 of them ... <B>Christ!</B> it must be a public
execution .. <B>Or worse!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill Pollock told me to take a seat ...So there I was sat facing
the 4 most important men in Scottish Train Catering ...Was I
nervous? ...You bet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My state of mind worsened as Mr. Langham picked a file up from the
desk and started to flick through it ...It was clearly marked</P>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">Ian C Fyvie - Chief Steward Relief -DOB 30-06-51</P>

<FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sitting in the chair, I suddenly became quite calm, After all I
was intending leaving anyway, So what difference would being
sacked make.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly Mr. Langham spoke - <B>&quot;I believe Congratulations 
    are in Order, Your expecting your first child - Mr. Fyvie.&quot;</B></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yes!&quot;... I stammered ...&quot;Thank you ...But 
    I somehow doubt that you three gentlemen travelled all the way from Glasgow 
    just to offer your congratulations to me&quot; (May as well force the issue 
    ..I Thought)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr. Langham smiled and replied <B>NO ...We want to talk to you about
something else.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Cutting a long uncomfortable story short.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They had been refurbishing the Catering store in Inverness Station
and it had been decided through internal politics that the person
in charge of the Store would be paid 60% by Train Catering and 40%
by Station Catering.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill Pollock had put my name forward for the Position</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next hour passed by in a flurry ...Talk of wages/Hours etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of all this conversations I asked for some time to talk
things over with my wife. I Promised to give my answer the next
day to Bill Pollock.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having left the office ..I headed for the Station Bar ..In 
    definite need of liquid sustenance .. After my second drink, Bill Pollock 
    suddenly appeared behind the Counter, Asking me to join him in his office.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This time it was just Him and I and he started going through the
various details.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main concern was the the Stores job paid LESS than the hourly
rate I was getting as a Chief Steward, however Bill got around
this by offering me two nights working in the Station Bar.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly had a lot to think about. On leaving Bills office I
bumped into one of Inverness's longest serving Chief Stewards.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy and I went for a quick drink and I told him about the Stores
Job offer.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I told him I was unsure if I would accept it or not, 
    He just looked at me and said "<B>Your a Damned fool if you don't</B>"</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>You know the score with Storemen delivering stuff to 
    the Trains</B>" he said ....<B>&quot;Its a 50p tip from every one ..With 20 
    trains a day leaving Inverness your going to make at least £10 Tax free every 
    day ...£50 a week on top of your wages&quot;.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Blimey ... I hadn't even though of that, This really made a big
difference ....Regular Hours of work ..Part time work in the
Station Bar and loads of Tips.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That night it didn't take me long to convince my wife that this
offer would solve your problems.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next day, I reported to Bill Pollock that I would accept the
offer ... My whole career was about to change.</P>
