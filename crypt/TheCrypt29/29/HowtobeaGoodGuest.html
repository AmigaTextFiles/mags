<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you're invited somewhere as "the guest," you really have a 
role to play, and it's an active one, not a passive one.  You're 
there to enjoy yourself, but it's also up to you to make a 
positive contribution to the gathering.  Here are some rules 
to fall back on when you're not sure</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you get a written or e-mailed invitation, R.S.V.P. Those 
letters stand for the French Respondez S'il Vous Plait which 
means "<B>respond, if you please</B>".  It's courteous to let your 
hosts know for meal planning, seating arrangements, etc. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Arrive 10-15 minutes after the invitation time (<B>but no later</B>). 
This gives your hosts and/or hostess those last few minutes to 
prepare.  Different parts of the country and different cultures 
handle time differently, but that's your best bet unless you 
know otherwise.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check and see if children are invited.  If they aren't, it's not 
fair to just show up with your kids saying you couldn't get a 
sitter.  The hostess may not have child-proofed her house, or may 
have sent her own children over to the in-laws', or there may be 
a troublesome unfriendly dog in the house.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't arrive empty-handed. Bring along a nice little gift with you
-- a bottle of wine, a bouquet of flowers, a packet of printed 
cocktail napkins, a little inspirational book ... You can never 
go wrong when you do something thoughtful.  But don't bring food; 
that's your hosts' province for the evening. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It's always polite to ask "May I bring something," if it's a dinner 
party.  If they say "Yes," ask what they'd like you to bring - meat 
dish, side, dish, dessert.</P>  

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you're there, offer to help in the kitchen and offer to help 
with the dishes. You may be told "no," but at least you asked. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Dad used to tell me "Don't be a bump on a log!" Well, this 
applies to being a good guest. It's up to YOU to make it a party. 
Talk to someone who's alone, mix and mingle, make good conversation, 
do your part. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduce interesting topics of conversation - good movies you've 
seen, places you've visited.  If you're stuck, ask the other person 
something - Do you have children?  Did you get away over the 
[holidays]?  Have you read [the latest bestseller]?  Where do you 
work?  Any of these questions will get the other person talking 
about their favorite topic - them!  You'd be the most popular person 
at the party if that's all you did all night long!</P>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Help in unobtrusive ways.  Empty some ash trays, take abandoned 
dishes to the kitchen, whisk your hosts' kid off to the bathroom, 
pass around a plate of hot hors d'oeuvres.  If you see something 
that needs doing, quietly do it.  Your hostess has her hands full!  
At one party I gave, a candle caught fire in the den.  I appreciated 
the guest who put it out, removed the tablecloth, cleaned up the 
mess, and then came and told me!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Don't overstay your welcome, no matter how much you're enjoying 
yourself. Why? You had a nap, got your nails done, watched the 
football game. They've been cooking and cleaning for days. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do you know when it's time to go home?  USE YOUR INTUITION. You 
may've been told 2-5, or just "come around 8", but your host and/or 
hostess will give off nonverbal signals when it's time for you to go 
home. They yawn, suddenly get up, start fidgeting and twisting, let 
the conversation lag, or even start doing the dishes!  Get a clue! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SAY GOOD-BYE.  Even if it's a large gathering, seek out the host and
/or hostess and tell them good bye, and thank them! </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Send a written thank-you note afterwards. It's just a nice thing to 
do. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Being a good guest means making a positive contribution to the 
gathering. And, oh yes, don't forget to have fun, because that's 
catching and everyone will appreciate it.</P>
