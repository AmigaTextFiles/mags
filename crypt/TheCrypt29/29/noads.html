<FONT COLOR=NAVY><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>ARRRGH ...</B> You are happily surfing the Internet and suddenly you
notice around 12/15 adverts windows have opened up without you
noticing them. You spend the next 5 minutes clicking each one to
close them. <B>NO MORE!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A  program called NoAds by South Bay Software that  you  can
download and use, for free (<B>link below</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It  works  by  listing specific pop up windows that your  computer
should not accept,  meaning that if a website tries to display one
of  the windows listed in your NoAds program,  your computer won't
allow it.  When using your browser and new ad windows pop up,  you
add it to NoAds and you'll never see that window again.</P>

<CENTER><B>How does it works?</B></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once  you have installed NoAds and have it running,  when a pop-up
ad appears:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>1.</B>   Double  click the NoAds icon in the system tray.  That's  the
area  of  the  taskbar next to the clock where icons  appear.   To
identify the NoAds icon,  rest the mousepointer over it and you'll
see a pop up giving you the name of the program.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.  Click on the tab for your web browser. The Standard tab is for
Internet Explorer and Netscape.</P>

<B>3.</B>  In the Currently Open Windows section, locate the title of the
ad you want removed and click once on it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>4. </B>  Click  on  the Add to Targets button and the window  will  be
added to the list below and automatically closed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>5.</B> Click on the Hide button to send NoAds back to the system tray.
If,  at some point,  you find you can't open a window you want  to
open,  you can close NoAds by right clicking on the icon and click
Exit.   If  this fixes the problem,  write down the  name  of  the
window  that you want to use,  open NoAds again and find the  name
of your window in the Windows targeted by NoAds section,  click on
it and then click the Remove button to remove it from the list.</P>
