  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you lived as a child in the 50's, 60's or 70's, looking 
    back, it's hard to believe that we have lived as long as we have... As children, 
    we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags. Our cots were covered 
    with bright coloured lead-based paint. We had no childproof lids on medicine 
    bottles, bleach bottles, doors, or cupboards; when we rode our bikes we had 
    no helmets.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  drank  water from the garden hose and not from a  bottle.   We
would  spend hours building go-carts out of scraps and  then  ride
down  the  hill,   only to find out we forgot the  brakes.   After
running  into  the  bushes a few times we  learned  to  solve  the
problem.  We would leave home in the morning and play all day,  as
long  as we were back when the streetlights came on.  No  one  was
able to reach us all day. No mobile phones.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We got cut and broke bones and broke teeth,  and there were no law
suits from these accidents.  They were accidents.  No one  was  to
blame, but us. Remember accidents?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  had  fights and punched each other and got black and blue  and
learned to get over it.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We ate cakes, bread and butter, and drank cordial, but we 
    were never overweight -- we were always outside playing. We shared one drink 
    with four friends, from one bottle and no one died from this. We did not have 
    Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, video games, 65 channels on pay TV, video 
    tape movies, surround sound, personal stereos, mobile phones, Personal Computers, 
    Internet chat rooms -- we had friends. We went outside and found them. We 
    rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rung the 
    bell, or just walked in and talked to them. Imagine such a thing. Without 
    asking a parent! By ourselves!</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Out there in the cold cruel world! Without a guardian - how 
    did we do it? We made up games with sticks and tennis balls, and ate worms, 
    and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes, 
    nor did the worms live inside us forever. Footy and netball had tryouts and 
    not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment..... 
    Some pupils weren't as smart as others, so they failed an exam and were held 
    back to repeat the same year. Tests were not adjusted for any reason. Our 
    actions were our own. Consequences were expected. No one to hide behind. The 
    idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually 
    sided with the law - imagine that! This generation has produced some of the 
    best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years 
    has been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, 
    success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And you're one of them. <B>Congratulations!</B> Please pass 
    this on to others who have had the luck to grow up as kids, before lawyers 
    and government regulated our lives -- for our own good!</P>
