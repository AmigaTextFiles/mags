<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did you ever see the bunny cakes in the grocery store bakery 
department? If you have, you may have noticed that they can be 
expensive. I'm going to tell you how to make your own so you can save 
money. <B>You'll need:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prepare the cake mix according to package directions and 
bake it in the round cake pan. Most cake mixes make enough batter for 
two round cake pans; therefore you can make two bunny cakes or 
make cupcakes with the rest of the batter if you only want to make one 
bunny cake. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the cake has cooled, remove it from the pan and cut 
the circle in half. With white frosting, frost the bottom of one of the 
halves generously, then stand the two halves up on their cut side on a 
plate or cake stand and push the two bottoms together so the frosting 
is in the middle holding them together. Now frost the whole thing.  It should
look like a half circle standing on a plate; this is the body of the bunny. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the eyes, cut two round circles out of white construction paper, 
then two smaller circles out of black construction paper and glue each 
black circle onto a white circle. Stick the eyes onto the frosting on the 
front of the bunny body (<B>one of the narrow ends</B>). </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the ears, cut bunny ear shapes, in proportion with the body, out of 
white construction paper. Cut smaller bunny ear shapes out of the pink 
construction paper and glue them onto the white ones to make the 
center of the ear. When glue has dried, insert the bottom of the ears 
into the frosting about an inch above the eyes. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For further decoration, lay Easter grass around the cake, place 
jellybeans on top of the grass and put coconut on the frosting of the 
cake as bunny hair. This cake makes a nice centerpiece for your table.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Use it with a vase of in-season flowers and there you have it. </P>
