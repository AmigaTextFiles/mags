<p>That renowned British melodic rock outfit Thunder has just released a new album.</p>
<p>Titled "Shooting at the Sun&quot;, it follows the reformation of Thunder  for 
  the Monsters of Rock tour last year.</p>
<p>You may remember Thunder split up after ten years together a couple of years 
  ago.</p>
<p>The hoohah of their fans never died, bombarding their website with requests 
  for the band to regroup.</p>
<p>Thankfully this has now happened and the new album is the result.</p>
<p>Right, down to the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>The new album has eleven tracks……..</p>
<p>Loser</p>
<p>Everybody’s laughing</p>
<p>If  I can’t find love</p>
<p>Shooting at the Sun</p>
<p>Pimp and the whore</p>
<p>A lover not a friend</p>
<p>Shake the tree</p>
<p>Somebody get me a Spin doctor</p>
<p>The man inside</p>
<p>Out of my head</p>
<p>Blown away</p>
<p>Of these, their EP (back for the crack) released for the Monsters of Rock tour 
  featured Spin doctor, Blown Away, Pimp and the whore, with the bonus track "when 
  tomorrow comes".</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/thunderrogrammecover.jpg" width="108" height="150"></p>
<p>Actually, I’m a little bit surprised that the bonus track didn’t make it onto 
  the album as it is a classy piece in its own right.</p>
<p>OK, so how does it sound?</p>
<p>Well, I might be the wrong person to ask, being a self confessed Thunder fan……..</p>
<p>However, I firmly believe that anyone who enjoys class melodic rock is going 
  to love this to death.</p>
<p>Thunder was always known for their live performances (and the aforementioned 
  tour was no exception). The only pity about the MOR tour was that Thunder didn’t 
  get nearly long enough………..</p>
<p>Danny Bowes has been rated as one of the top British rock singers and his voice 
  was stronger on this tour than I have heard for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Right, back to the album -- musn’t get side tracked here -- did I mention they 
  are touring in May? </p>
<p>The album starts with &quot;Loser&quot;</p>
<p>This is going to be a massive Thunder favourite I predict. From the start with 
  Danny wailing "Now I know you don’t love me , Baby" to the crushing riff, this 
  is a sure-fire classic. Thunder use melody well and the chorus will be ringing 
  round the concert venues soon.</p>
<p>The album seems to have a lot more keyboards on this outing , which is no bad 
  thing, but it never obscures the main guitar of Luke Morley. Ben Matthews ( 
  rhythm and keyboards) enjoys himself on some of the tracks as well as complementing 
  those exquisite solos.</p>
<p>Followed by "Everybody’s Laughing" . This is a nice , jaunty little number 
  with a great British barroom boogie type riff. The wah wah solo has its highs 
  as well…………</p>
<p>We then move onto "If I Can’t Feel Love". A nice slow bluesy number, this one. 
  Starts with acoustic and slowly builds into another  lead driven Thunder class 
  act. This is the type of song that Thunder does so well.</p>
<p>The title song follows with its mix of blues, riffs and  funky stuff. A fitting 
  track for the title, as it showcases what Thunder are all about.</p>
<p>Fifth up is the &quot;Pimp and the Whore&quot; which was on the /Back for the 
  Crack/ CD. </p>
<p>A nice rock tune as always with a solid backbeat from that legendary twosome 
  Chris Childs and Harry James (bass and drums).</p>
<p>Harry, despite having a drink thrown over him by Pamela Anderson  (in one of 
  the band's videos) has always managed to upstage everyone with his green wig 
  and acoustic guitar playing …………</p>
<p>The band go back to their sad melodic roots on "A Loser Not a Friend" Another 
  lovely slice of style, this one.</p>
<p>We then move on to "Shake the Tree" An acoustic intro blends into a lovely 
  blend of riffs and vocals. Some delicious playing by Luke, and Danny sounds 
  in fine form. This is another live track that’s going to get hammered on-stage, 
  I predict. Love the end piece with the downslide aka a very old single by Family 
  "in my own time" Excellent!</p>
<p>Now for that peculiarly entitled "Somebody Get Me a Spin Doctor".</p>
<p>Thunder was in the vanguard of the "Cool Britannia" brigade. This sounds like 
  Blair will wince when he hears it A lovely class ( I’m sorry to keep using that 
  word, but its true!) rock toon. Power riffs and a wicked lyric combine to give 
  the Labour party the shivers when they hear this one! Danny does that wicked 
  laugh of his to great effect on this one. A personal favourite of mine.</p>
<p>"The Man Inside" heads back into the slower side of things and uses loads of 
  keyboards, which is a small departure but helps showcase Danny's vocals. "Does 
  Your Face Hurt From Smiling Too Much"? Listening to this will get your head 
  nodding along with the melody. </p>
<p>"Out of My Head" heads back into rock country . Lovely power riff, I can see 
  Morley strutting his stuff to this.</p>
<p>The final slice is "Blown Away". Again, this featured on the EP , so will be 
  well known by the fans. Another one of the slower tracks at the start, it grows 
  into another large riffed song with Bowes staying on top of it. </p>
<p>If you like melodic rock with bags of style and power, this is for you. All 
  Thunder fans will know what to expect with this album.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/thunderpic2.jpg" width="225" height="125"></p>
<p>I'd have loved Bowes to get stretched more as he was on "Empty City" Still, 
  maybe next time. The whole band sounds very tight and play well, no mean feat. 
  See what the present day bands miss entirely by giving this a listen.</p>
<p>The album is on pre-release from 3<sup>rd</sup> of March and can be ordered
