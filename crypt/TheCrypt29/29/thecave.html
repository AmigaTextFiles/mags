<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  am  31 years old now,  but I can remember that day in the woods
some  19 years ago like it was yesterday.  My best friend  at  the
time,   Paul,   and  I  were out exploring  some  woods  near  his
grandmother's farm in rural SE Missouri in the United States.  Not
being too far from the Ozark mountain range,  the terrain is hilly
and well covered with thick, tall green trees.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That area of Missouri, and all the way up to Kansas City, 
    is well known for having hundreds, if not thousands, of limestone caves. We 
    were a few miles east of the farm, on god only knows whose land, when we discovered 
    a dilapidated old shack, not more than 15 feet by 20 feet in size. Only 3 
    of the 4 walls remained, and the roof was caved in along the side of the missing 
    wall. You could still go through the front door and walk a few feet into the 
    structure, but that was about it. Being curious 12-year-olds, we did just 
    that.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From all indications, it looked like an old shanty or shack 
    built by some wanderer or recluse. It was very crudely built, with uneven 
    log sizes and dried mud or clay as mortar. There was evidence of a fireplace 
    and we could even a see the headrest of a mostly hidden handmade bed in the 
    corner, the rest obscured by the roof that had collapsed forming a wall-like 
    barrier blocking any further exploration.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We rummaged around where we could and noticed a lot of twigs 
    and rocks lying around the mostly dirt floor. No one had lived there for quite 
    some time, as it had been exposed to the elements for years. We left the little 
    shack and decided to head back to his grandmother's farm for lunch. As we 
    rounded the back of the shack, we were stunned to see strange markings carved 
    into the wood on the back wall. Most were weathered beyond recognition, but 
    you could still make out some. They were blocky and were made up of a lot 
    of connected lines and geometric, yet asymmetrical shapes. There were also 
    strange markings that to us looked like ancient Sanskrit writing, but not 
    quite. I can't remember any specifics, so it's pointless to try to draw anything 
    that resembled what we saw for use as an example.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To further the mystery, not more than 20 feet from the back 
    wall of the shack was a large decrepit wood platform that seemed to be covering 
    a large hole. We walked over to it and bent down to examine it more closely. 
    There were similar markings all over the platform. They were weather-worn 
    and hard to make out. I poked around the edges of the platform and could feel 
    air escaping.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>I bet this is covering an entrance to a cave.</B>" I said.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Let's just see about that</B></I>," Paul said.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  got  up  and  found a large rock that was  strewn  about  with
others around the hole.  He lifted it over his head and thrust  it
down on the platform.  Not even likely to withstand a punch with a
bare  fist,   the rotted wood splintered into pieces and  revealed
what we had assumed.  After we cleared away more of the wood,   we
could tell it was an entrance to a fairly large cave.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Timidly,  we both stuck our heads into the cave to see how deep it
was  and  were pleasantly surprised to see that the initial  slope
into darkness was shallow and walkable.  We'd have to duck, but we
could  manage  to explore this cave without much hassle.   Excited
about  the prospect of exploring our "own" little cave we  decided
to  rush back to the farm and get flashlights,  a little rope  and
grab lunch while we were there.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We ran as much as we could and got back to the farm in just 
    under an hour. The sun was directly overhead and the late summer sun was hot. 
    On the way there, we decided not to be wholly truthful about why we were grabbing 
    flashlights and rope, if we were even caught doing so, because as far as parents 
    go, Paul's were conservative-enough so not to allow cave exploring without 
    supervision, and they weren't likely to drag themselves all the way out there 
    for our benefit. We quickly ate lunch and were lucky enough to get all of 
    our needed supplies in one of the out buildings completely unnoticed. We grabbed 
    two flashlights, roughly a 100-foot loop of rope, and a canteen of water, 
    and headed out back towards the cave.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul and I wandered a bit trying to relocate the shack and 
    the cave entrance, as it wasn't near any telling landmarks. After zigzagging 
    a bit, we finally crested a small hill and found the shack and nearby cave 
    entrance. This time, however, it had a more disquieting look to it. I couldn't 
    put my finger on it at the time, but things just didn't look right . or smell 
    right -- and even worse, feel right. Despite that initial wave of uneasiness, 
    Paul and I were too determined to let silly circumstances get in the way of 
    another adventure.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We stopped a minute to examine the strange markings on the 
    on the back wall and remained mystified as to what they were or what they 
    meant. Since Paul has explored a few more caves in the area than I, he opted 
    to go in first to light the way. We tied the rope to a dead tree trunk a few 
    feet away from the entrance and dropped the rest of the length into the hole. 
    Paul lowered himself to the edge and dangled his feet into the hole. He pointed 
    the flashlight down, confirmed it was more of a downward slope than an immediate 
    hole, and then slid slowly into the darkness. Standing over the hole and peering 
    in after him I waited for his comment that it was safe to follow. After 30 
    seconds or so, I was greeted instead with a brief shout of terror from Paul, 
    followed promptly with a gasp of relief.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>What happened?</B>" I shouted.</P>

  "<I><B>Well, I thought the hill was going to last for a while, and all of a sudden 
  it ends with a steep drop off, but luckily the drop is only 3 or 4 feet.</B></I>" 
  He answered. "<I><B>It's safe to come on down now, just go slow and watch for 
  the drop.</B></I>" 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not  exactly comforted,  I obliged and grabbed the rope and  began
my  own  descent into darkness.  I found the drop off and  lowered
myself slowly.  Once standing I could look up about 30 feet at the
small  hole  that we entered through,  or look forward  through  a
cave  tunnel that resembled a vein in a coal mine except  that  it
was  littered with stalagmites and stalactites.  It  was  about  5
feet high and 8 feet across.  It was damp inside but there was  no
standing  water.  That meant it went on further  and  deeper  than
what  we  could  initially see.  We carefully walked  through  the
obstacle  course of cave formations and entered  deeper  into  the
cave.   The tunnel ran steadily down hill,  deeper into  the  dark
abyss.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we clamored down deeper into the earth, I was stunned 
    by the total lack of evidence of bug and animal presence. Even in small caves, 
    you'll find animal droppings and spider webs. But this cave was totally devoid 
    of life. Another strange thing we noticed as we delved deeper and deeper was 
    the temperature. It was not getting cooler as one would expect. Even a few 
    feet underground, temperatures in caves can drop to as low as 50 to 60 degrees. 
    The temperature in this cave was still just as warm as, if not warmer than, 
    outside on the surface. The air was also stagnant and stale. It was as if 
    you had to breath as deeply to get the same amount of air you would normally. 
    All in all, these things didn't add up as we explored; they are just things 
    we noticed and talked about later after our experience.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continued on downwards through this long shaft that resembled 
    a spiral staircase without the stairs until it narrowed considerably and began 
    to drop steeper. It was still nothing that required rope or safety equipment, 
    but now it required more direct attention. At this point we were roughly 150 
    to 180 feet underground, nothing to sneeze at as far as caves go, and we wondered 
    why there wasn't more evidence of other cave explorers. "<B>Surely this cave 
    was worthy of exploration,</B>" I thought to myself. We continued spiraling 
    downward until we had long lost site of the opening to the cave.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  15  minutes or so of steady descent,  Paul  and  I  finally
reached  the bottom of the spiraling tunnel as it simply  came  to
an  end.  It would have been the end of the expedition if not  for
the  small opening near the floor.  It was a scant 18 inches  high
and  just  a  foot or two across,  but it was just big enough  for
Paul to lie down on his stomach and stick his flashlight and  head
through.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>Cool</B></I>!" he said excitedly.  "<I><B>It's another chamber.  I think we can
fit through this hole. Let me try.</B></I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With  that,  he shimmied and squirmed,  but eventually managed  to
work his way through the hole.  Knowing I was a hair thinner  than
Paul,   I  knew  I  wouldn't have much trouble.   After  a  little
squirming and shimmying myself,  I was through.  I brushed  myself
off  as  I stood fully erect and looked around with my flashlight.
The  chamber had an eerie feel to it,  but nothing seemed  odd  or
out of the ordinary at first.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ceiling was at least 30 feet high and the room itself 
    was probably 35-40 feet in diameter. The rock in here was relatively smooth 
    as the floor was also clear of stalagmites. One would guess this room was 
    hollowed out by a swell in ground water, but had remained dry since the water 
    had receded. We searched around the walls with our flashlights until I suggested 
    we turn them off to see how dark it really was (a fun thing to do deep in 
    caves since there is no other dark that can compare). I turned my flashlight 
    off first, then a few seconds later Paul turned his off as well. You could 
    imagine our shock when we could still see each other's faces in what should 
    have been complete and utter darkness.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no discernable light source, but an overall reddish 
    luminance to the room that was unnoticeable with our artificially lit flashlights. 
    The walls seemed to glow and pulse a deeper and brighter red with each passing 
    moment, almost as if we were waking them up from a long slumber. We turned 
    our lights back on and began to search the room for clues as to why the walls 
    were glowing. Off in one corner, my flashlight made a grisly discovery. I 
    discovered what appeared to be small chunks of bone and tattered clothing 
    surrounded by a nearly shattered and broken skull. Just a few feet away, there 
    was another skull, this one neatly sliced in two, and again scattered next 
    to smaller chunks of bone. In this pile, I could see what looked like a lacy 
    hem of a girl or woman's skirt. Paul had also noticed what I was staring at 
    and looked on in equal disbelief. Just as I started to approach the remains 
    for closer inspection, I heard a sound that chilled me to the bone.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">I distinctly heard a girl's voice whisper in my ear,<font color="YELLOW"> 
    </font><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>"<B>Get out!</B>" <FONT COLOR=SILVER>and then an 
    even more desperate,<FONT COLOR=YELLOW> "<B>Run!</B>"</font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=YELLOW><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Completely freaked,  I turned to Paul who had obviously  heard  it
too, and we began to inch our way closer to the room's exit.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then  the  floor of the chamber began to tremble and a very  faint
humming  drone  began  to  resonate through  the  chamber.   Being
completely terrified already,  we didn't want to stick  around  to
find  out  what  the hell was about to happen.  I  took  off  back
towards  the entrance and Paul quickly followed suit.  The  ground
was  shaking  so badly,  I was afraid there was an  earthquake  or
that the chamber was going to collapse down upon us.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was the first to make it to the chamber's exit, which seemed 
    little more than a mole hole now, and start squirming and squeezing through. 
    Paul was yelling for me to hurry and I obliged, skinning my knees and elbows 
    as I forced my way through. Once I was back into the tunnel I turned around 
    to help Paul. He was almost frantic, trying to squeeze through. If I didn't 
    know better, I would have thought that hole was shrinking right before my 
    eyes. Paul struggled and struggled and I dropped my flashlight to help pull 
    him through with both hands. Paul screamed in what I thought was agony from 
    me tugging too hard, but he looked up at me with complete terror in his eyes.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>Something is touching my legs</B></I>! <I><B>Something 
    is touching my legs! Pull harder</B></I>!" He screamed. With all my strength 
    I yanked him once more, and with that last tug he finally squeezed through. 
    As I saw his feet come through the hole I noticed with the light from my dropped 
    flashlight what resembled a hand releasing its grip on Paul's calf - a hand 
    without really being a hand. It had the rough shape of an oversized hand -- 
    or paw -- with no discernable fingers or shape. It was almost like a shadow; 
    transparent, yet with a solid shape. That was all I saw of it because the 
    second Paul was up and running, I turned and ran as well, leaving my flashlight 
    there near the hole. Since Paul still had his light, I yelled at him to wait 
    for me and he slowed just enough so that I could follow his footsteps. All 
    the while, the droning noise hum grew louder and louder. The glow from the 
    room below began to illuminate the tunnel from behind us as a sick smell of 
    rotting meat and bile began to overtake us. It was so strong it stung our 
    noses.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We scrambled up and up, running as fast as we could. The 
    spiraling effect of the tunnel was disorienting and the fear was starting 
    to take it effects on us. If Paul wasn't tripping on something or banging 
    his head, then I was, and the escape to the surface seemed to take forever. 
    We had made enough turns and climbed enough that light from below should have 
    been left far behind, but instead it seemed to be getting closer. and brighter, 
    lighting the tunnel below in a sickly blood-red light. We finally reached 
    the long, straighter tunnel that led to the eventual ledge and slope to the 
    cave's exit. Paul and I were able to finally pick up speed and put some distance 
    between us and the light from below -- almost, but not quite, outrunning the 
    overpowering stench. However, the droning sound still continued to grow louder 
    and even higher pitched, like a teakettle approaching the boiling point.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul and I reached the ledge and slope at the same time and 
    were shocked and horrified to see nothing but darkness. We had only been in 
    the cave for about 30 minutes total, meaning it was still mid-afternoon outside. 
    Paul aimed his flashlight up at the where the hole was and what we saw chilled 
    us to the bone. Our rope was gone and the hole was covered with the same plank 
    wood that had covered it previously. Paul and I both jumped up to the slope 
    and began to drag ourselves upwards towards the exit. It wasn't so steep that 
    we couldn't traverse it, but for every two feet you gained, you slid back 
    down a foot, so it was slow going. The light from below was again beginning 
    to encroach on us, and the droning was louder and higher- pitched still. We 
    finally reached the exit and began to explore options on how to get out. We 
    pushed and pushed on the wood covering, but there seemed to be an enormous 
    amount of weight on it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We  started  screaming for help,  pounding on the  makeshift  trap
door.   The  light below seemed to be just around the last  corner
from  the  straightaway  tunnel and finally  it  turned,   rushing
upwards  towards  us,   flickering   with  a  blinding  speed  and
intensity.   Just  as  we  needed  to  cover  our  eyes  from  the
brightness  we screamed at the top of our lungs.  Instantly,   the
light  faded to darkness.  like it fell from the ceiling  down  to
the  floor as a wave of water would.  The droning hum stopped  and
the stench faded as well.  The only sound that could be heard  was
our own heavy breathing.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<B>What in ... the hell was ... that?</B>" I panted out, trying 
    to catch my breath that was lost to fear.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>I  don't know,  but let's get out of here.</B></I>" Paul answered  as  he
began  probing the edges of the cave exit for a hole or  something
we  could  use as a starting point.  Feeling momentarily relieved,
we both started pounding on the trapdoor once again.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then without warning or notice we heard a horrible crash 
    below us followed by a sound that gives me nightmares to this day. A horrible, 
    almost demonic gurgling sound came storming up the tunnel. Paul's flashlight 
    immediately went dead and we were thrust into complete and total darkness. 
    The gurgling grew closer and closer and now we were too scared to even scream. 
    I remember pressing myself against the rock wall and remaining there, frozen 
    in fear, reduced to no other capacity than to just listen. I could not speak. 
    I could not move. I could not see. All I could do was to listen as the gurgling 
    began to transform into more of a primal scream as it flew up the tunnel towards 
    us like a freight train going 200 miles per hour. The air grew searing hot 
    and a putrid wind swirled around us. My hair stood up on end and as a scream 
    seemed to pierce my body. It was as if a young girl let out a tortured scream 
    directly in my ear.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was about to pass out from either fear or stress when we 
    felt something semi-solid surge past us, exploding through the trapdoor like 
    an invisible missile. Shards of wood rained down us as sunlight flooded in 
    and exposed Paul and I to each other's mortified faces. Almost reading each 
    other's minds, we shot through the exit, me first, then Paul. We quickly stood 
    up and brushed ourselves off. Not knowing whether to run or collapse, we just 
    stared at each other waiting for the other to make a move. Just then, a shoddily 
    dressed man came around the corner from the front of the shack. His hair was 
    long and unkempt and he had deep lines crisscrossing his face.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite our initial reaction to run in fear, there was something 
    about the man that made us stay, something non- threatening and almost peaceful. 
    As he approached us slowly, we heard the screaming entity quickly returning, 
    as if it had simply burst through the exit, completed a small loop around 
    the woods and was returning to finish us off. We could hear trees snapping 
    in the distance as that thing was bulldozing anything in its path. Again, 
    strangely frozen in fear, Paul and I stood nearly frozen, powerless to stop 
    the thing rushing towards us and powerless to move. The old man stopped his 
    approach towards us and his concerned face transformed into one of steeled 
    determination. He raised his arms into the air as if he was reaching for the 
    clouds and began sternly chanting some language I did not recognize or understand.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  howling  scream crested the hill and we could finally  see  a
dark shape,  almost like a black cloud of soot without just enough
form  to  be  called solid.  It flew down the hill,  toppling  the
small  trees  that  stood between it and the old  man  like  match
sticks.  The haggard old man blocked the entity's path towards  us
and  chanted those strange words again.  This time,  they seem  to
echo and reverberate through the woods like a howl of a wolf.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creature slowed, and as if it had legs, seemed to take 
    a step back. Then a light again began to emanate from the entrance to the 
    cave. But it was not the sickly blood red light that was there previously, 
    but a white light, almost too bright to look at directly. The creature appeared 
    to struggle against it, but fruitlessly, and it was literally dragged back 
    down the hole, letting loose a deafening scream in protest. The light seemed 
    to envelop the creature as it reached its grasp. The screaming wail was silenced 
    and the light retreated back down deep into the cave with its prisoner as 
    quickly as it appeared.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stunned with disbelief and shock,  Paul and I just stared  at  the
old  man.  He walked over to the hole and with a wave of his hand,
the  broken covering was once again made whole.  The markings that
we  had  seen  earlier  gradually reappeared  and  looked  freshly
carved  into the wood.  Once he felt his task completed,  the  old
man again took notice of us and asked if we were okay.  Paul and I
both  looked at our bodies as if we were checking for  any  number
of  untold wounds.  Outside of skinned knees and elbows,  we  were
both just dirty and dripping with sweat, so we merely nodded.</P>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"You two nearly met your end there," </B><FONT COLOR=SILVER>said the old man.</font></P><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>Who... I mean ... What was that</B></I>?" Paul stammered.</P>

<FONT COLOR=RED>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>"It was evil -- cruel and eternal. You could call it a 
    demon or you could call it the devil."</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER> He paused for 
    a second and then continued. <FONT COLOR=RED> <B>"It is both ... and it is 
    neither,"</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER> said the old man as his voice trailed off. 
    <FONT COLOR=RED> <B>"What's important is that it didn't get to feed again. 
    It grows much more powerful if it gets to feed."</B></font></font></font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that, the man drew a sad look on his face and stepped 
    back towards the shack. He crossed in front of us and walked to the rear wall 
    facing the cave entrance. He chanted a few more lines of that strange language 
    and the marks on that wall seemed to disappear and reappear again, only looking 
    freshened and newly carved. He then walked around the shed and out of view. 
    Paul and I again glanced at each other, and for the first time, seemed to 
    have full use of our bodies back. Full of questions, we raced around the half-collapsed 
    shed to get some more answers.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were more than stunned to discover nothing but emptiness. 
    Only a few seconds behind him, there was no way he could have walked out of 
    view and he certainly wasn't inside the shack either. We called out to him, 
    ran clear around the shed, even ran up the hill to see if he had tried to 
    run away. No sign of him anywhere: no footprints and no sounds. It was if 
    he had disappeared into thin air.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now  thoroughly baffled and confused,  we re-entered the  shed  to
verify he wasn't hiding in there and this time we even pushed  our
way  through  the collapsed part of the roof.  Behind  the  sunken
barrier  we  found  what we were looking for.  A  dilapidated  and
almost  completely  decomposed corpse of a man  wearing  identical
clothes  to  the  old man who had helped us  just  a  few  minutes
before.   He  was holding an old black and white photograph  in  a
dingy and broken frame.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul  slid  it from under the man's hand and held  it  up  to  the
light.   It  appeared to be a much younger version of him,   along
with  what  appeared  to be his wife and a  daughter.   They  were
standing  in front of a nice farmhouse and looked genuinely  happy
together.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paul  gently  slipped the photo back under  his  hand.   Then,   I
noticed something else near the foot of the so-called bed  he  was
lying in.  I bent over and brushed off the dust and could tell  it
was a book.  I opened it up and flipped through the pages.  It was
a journal or diary of some kind.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<B>I'll  bet  we'll find some answers here,</B>" I said as I slipped  it
under my arm. "<B>Let's get out of here.</B>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I><B>I couldn't agree more</B></I>," Paul said.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And with that we pushed our way back out of the shed and 
    made a beeline for his grandmother's farm, which seemed an eternity away. 
    We hardly spoke on the entire trip back there, each of us reflecting on what 
    had happened and reevaluating many of the things we had previously believed 
    and held true and how those ideas had been shattered by what we had just experienced. 
    When we got there we quickly cleaned ourselves up with the garden hose out 
    in the backyard and went inside. Paul and I each drank several glasses of 
    water after noticing neither one of us had returned with the canteen. To this 
    day I have no idea what happened to it or the rope! They simply must have 
    been lost in the struggle somewhere.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once we felt refreshed and comparatively safe, we took the 
    old tattered journal up to the spare bedroom and began to pore over the pages. 
    Most of the stuff we read concerning the cave and what was down there we didn't 
    understand at the time. Most of the pages were littered with discombobulated 
    thoughts and gibberish, and his handwriting was difficult to read. It wasn't 
    until revisiting the journal several times over the following years later 
    that I was finally able to make some kind of sense of what had happened around 
    that cave.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From what I could tell,  the man, his wife and daughter moved into
the  area  and  built  a nice house while farming  the  land  they
owned.   This dates back to the late 1890s.  Then  one  day,   the
daughter  went  out exploring the woods with a  friend  who  lived
near  by.  This was a regular occurrence because according to  her
father,   she was rather adventurous and was always traipsing  out
in  the woods in one direction or the other.  After spraining  her
knee in a fall and having to be found after she couldn't make  her
way  home,  her mother and father always made her go with  someone
else.   Anyway,  her and her friend went out one  fall  day,   and
neither of them was ever seen again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  man  and his wife,  along with the friend's family,  searched
the woods that night and all the next day.  The local sheriff  and
his deputies,  along with other concerned families from around the
area  joined  the  search  as well.  Despite  all  those  people's
efforts,  the girl and her friend were never found.  Two weeks  or
so  later,  refusing to give up,  the man and his wife were  still
canvassing  the woods around their property.  During  the  search,
the  man  and his wife discovered the entrance to a cave  that  no
one knew existed.  Fearing their daughter made the same discovery,
they decided to enter and look around.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  journal then describes a horrifying scene.  Just a  few  feet
into  the  cave,  the mother apparently found a ribbon that  their
daughter  frequently wore in her hair.  It was covered with  dried
blood.   Distraught  and overcome with grief,   the  mother  began
running down deeper into the cave.  The man, slowed by a limp from
a  recent ankle sprain of his own,  was unable to convince her  to
wait  for  him  or come back later with help.  He  begged  her  to
return,   but  she  just ignored him and ran down  the  same  dark
tunnel  that  Paul  and  I explored,  yelling  for  her  daughter.
Knowing his ankle would prevent him from delving too far into  the
cave,  he decided to remain near the entrance and wait to hear his
wife beckon him or return with whatever she found.  He would never
see his wife alive again.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He  could  hear  her screaming out their daughter's name,   Emily,
over and over again,  despite the fact it was getting fainter  and
fainter as she descended further into the cave.  Then, without any
prior indication something was wrong,  he heard his wife let out a
blood-curdling scream.  Closing his eyes in sadness  and  despair,
thinking  his  wife had just discovered their daughter's  body  he
yelled  out to her,  but never received a response.  What  he  got
instead was a taste of what Paul and I endured.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He described a very similar event to the one we experienced, 
    starting with the earthquake-like tremors deep in the cave, except from his 
    perspective from near the entrance, it was much more subdued. He yelled down 
    to his wife for her to return, fearing a cave-in as we did, but again, he 
    heard no answer. Then he described hearing a high-pitch wail coming up the 
    tunnel, an inhuman sound he knew couldn't be human. Fearing it was some kind 
    of wild animal, he pulled himself out of the cave and scuttled quickly over 
    the nearby hill, crouching behind a stump to see if anything exited the cave 
    from a hidden perspective. He heard the wail growing louder and louder and 
    described seeing a sickly red light emanating from the cave, and as it faded, 
    a black shape shot out of the cave like a cannonball.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  shape  shot  up in the air at least 50 feet and  then  glided
back down to earth,  holding something in its appendages.  It  was
the  one-armed  torso  of  his  wife.   He  recognized  the  torn,
bloodstained blue dress that draped off of it.  The man  described
the horror of seeing this as being all most too much to bear,  but
something  beyond his control forced him to look on.   The  shadow
creature continued to feed on his wife's body,  slashing  it  into
pieces,  as it seemed to swim in the blood. It was if the creature
needed blood instead of meat.  The man also described the creature
becoming more "solid" as it writhed in the blood,  consuming  what
it could.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realizing that this creature had just murdered his wife, 
    and recently his daughter and her friend, he quietly turned and slunk down 
    the backside of the hill and broke into a dead run back to his homestead, 
    ignoring his swollen and sore ankle. Enraged with anger and grief, the man 
    burst into his house and grabbed his shotgun. He stuffed as many shells as 
    he could into his jacket and loaded the gun. Bent on revenge, he began the 
    long run back to the where he had left the creature still devouring the remains 
    of his wife. When he finally arrived back at his hidden vantage point he could 
    tell the creature was no longer around. He carefully inched down the hill 
    towards the grisly scene just outside the cave's entrance. Blood stained the 
    grass and leaves; his wife's tattered dress was shredded into unrecognizable 
    threads. There were small pieces of entrails and flesh scattered about, but 
    nothing big enough to be recognizable as human.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overcome  with  grief,  he fell to his  knees  and  began  to  sob
uncontrollably.  He stayed there for several minutes, just running
his  fingers through the blood-red material,  occasionally finding
something recognizable like a hair from her missing head stuck  to
a  piece  of  tattered fabric.  Images of his  wife  and  daughter
flooded his mind and again he became enraged with a primal  anger.
He  stood up,  raised his gun into the air and yelled out  to  the
beast  for it to come for him.  He yelled down into the cave,   he
yelled up into the air,  he yelled at the top of his lungs for  it
to come. It didn't take long for it to answer his call.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Screaming over the hill behind him tore the creature, now 
    almost entirely solid. He described it as a thick-skinned, black beast, trailed 
    by a wispy, dark mist that seemed to roll off it like steam rolls off campfire 
    doused with water. Its eyes burned a deep red and pierced his gaze like two 
    hot pokers. The beast plunged towards him, its arms extended with giant scythe-like 
    appendages ready to slice him in half. He calmly leveled his shotgun and waited 
    until the last second, when he could feel the beast's hot breath on his face 
    before he pulled the trigger. The creature's upper body exploded into a cloud 
    of black dust. The creature's lower body, separated from the upper half, continued 
    on, slamming into the man and pinning him to the ground, knocking the wind 
    out of him.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It writhed and convulsed on top of him as he struggled beneath 
    its weight. Slowly, it turned into weightless black dust, falling off of the 
    man in chunks of dried ash. He was eventually able to stand up and brush himself 
    off. As he gathered his breath back and looked around, he felt a strong breeze 
    materialize out of nowhere. It wasn't so much a wind blowing him in the face 
    as it was a force of suction behind him, pulling the air around and past him. 
    He braced himself against a small tree and watched as the dusty remains of 
    the creature gathered once again into a faint shadow and dragged itself back 
    into the hole. He shot at it right before it left his sight, but his shot 
    simply blew through the dust cloud and struck the cave entrance's wall instead. 
    It was no longer solid, just a dark cloud as he explained it. The man ran 
    to the entrance and looked down into the darkness, and he heard a faint wail 
    and then silence. With that, he turned and limped home.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According  to  the journal,  he then visited  the  family  of  his
daughter's friend and tried to explain what happened.  Saddened by
the  news  that their child was likely dead as well,  the friend's
mother  and  father returned to the site with him.  They  saw  the
blood  and  tattered  remains of his wife.  The  friends'  father,
referred to as William,  kept insisting that it must have  been  a
bear of some kind,  and that the event that followed was merely  a
figment  of  the  man's  enraged grief.  Unable  to  convince  him
otherwise,  he did get him to help cover the cave's entrance  with
logs  and dead tree branches that they collected.  They  piled  it
deep enough over the hole to prevent anything from getting  in  or
out until a more permanent structure could be built.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Details followed about the funerals, about building a solid 
    and permanent covering to the cave entrance hole, about how no one would believe 
    him about the shadow creature. Everyone in the county thought he had lost 
    his mind upon seeing the death of his wife, and he drew more and more withdrawn 
    from his surrounding townsfolk until he was essentially a recluse. However, 
    he remained determined to find out what it was down in that cave. He searched 
    through the town's library, through medieval reference books, to the bible, 
    and even mythology books. Nothing was ever found to describe what he had seen 
    and experienced.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It wasn't until one winter day, some months later, when he 
    heard a knock at the door that he got his answer. His journal explains that 
    a local Native American, whose parents had stayed behind when their Arapaho 
    tribe was forced out of the land onto a reservation in Oklahoma, had heard 
    of his story. He claimed to know the origin of such a creature; that it was 
    an old tale passed down through his tribe, which had lived on the surrounding 
    land for thousands of years. They referred to it as a Gros'lor (at least that 
    is how it was pronounced according the man). It was a "soul eater", a creature 
    of untold origin and power that hibernated for decades and came out to feed 
    on people or their souls. only to return to a long slumber shortly after terrorizing 
    nearby humans and animals.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His tribe's Shamans had long held incantations and spells that 
    kept the soul eater in check, limiting its power and forcing it to remain 
    dormant for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, the removal of the Arapaho tribe 
    and its power against the beast allowed for its awakening by the man's daughter 
    and her friend as they entered its lair.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that knowledge in hand, the man collected his things 
    and left for Oklahoma in hopes of talking with someone who still knew what 
    to do to contain the creature. His journal describes very little about the 
    trip and what he discovered in Oklahoma, but he referred to an Arapaho reservation 
    and a shaman named Hache-hi who was able to recount the tale and knew the 
    spells that had been passed down from his grandfather. Apparently, these incantations 
    bound the person to the creature in a way that even after death the two would 
    struggle against one another. The spirit of the spell-giver would even remain 
    after death to contain the beast as long as the line of living shamans kept 
    up with the frequent spells and incantations needed to keep the spirit alive 
    and on this plane of existence. Without maintenance, the spirit would eventually 
    fade and cross over to the next plane, and nothing would remain to contain 
    the soul eater.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing his family was gone and no one in town believed his 
    story he decided to build a small one-room house, letting his original house 
    fall into ruin. He built it out near the hole in order to perform the ritual 
    on a regular basis, and to prevent anyone from trying to enter the cave again. 
    He basically decided to dedicate the rest of his life to protecting the area 
    from any further attacks from the creature. Since no one would be following 
    his watch after his death, he had hoped that carving the symbols that translated 
    into the spell on the cave's covering platform and again on the wall of his 
    house that faced the hole would keep his spirit around after his death, as 
    well as the creature contained in its lair.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apparently it had worked. Although Paul and I had destroyed 
    the covering to the cave and the incantations engraved into it, there was 
    enough power left for the man to return to our plane of existence long enough 
    to contain the creature once again. After his battle the markings returned 
    fresh and renewed, giving his spirit a recharge in the battle of containing 
    the beast.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After  reading  his journal and understanding what  had  happened,
Paul  and I felt safe to return to the area and explore  a  little
more.   We found two unmarked gravestones on what must  have  been
the site of his original home about a mile past the cave.  Only  a
few  blocks of foundation brick remained.  The shack and new  cave
covering,   however,   remained   intact  for  all  the  years  we
occasionally revisited the site.  We never told anyone  about  our
experience. Who would believe us?</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many questions go unanswered till this day. Where did that 
    thing come from? Is it a natural creature of earth, a demon, an alien, or 
    some other ancient creature? Are there any more of them out there, still living 
    the cycle of feeding and hibernating? Who or what recovered the hole while 
    we were in the cave? Was it the spell trying to contain the beast or was it 
    some other force trying to keep us in there for the creature to feed on? Why 
    didn't the beast kill us while it had us trapped instead of breaking through 
    the barrier and coming back for us then? Maybe it wasn't strong enough yet; 
    who knows. All I know is that there are things on this earth still left for 
    us to discover and understand.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paranormal exists,  for good and for evil. Most importantly, I
know  I'm  lucky to be alive and I thank that old man each  day  I
continue on due to his eternal vigilance.</P>
