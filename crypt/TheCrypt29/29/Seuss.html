 <CENTER><B>The Whos down in Whoville liked people a lot,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>But the Grinch in the White House most certainly did not.</B>  </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>He didn't arrive there by the will of the Whos, </B></CENTER> 
<CENTER><B>But stole the election that he really did lose. </B> </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Vowed to "rule from the middle," then installed his regime.</B> </CENTER> 
<CENTER><B>(Did this really happen, or is it just a bad  dream?)</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>He didn't listen to voters, just his friends he was pleasin'</B> </CENTER> 
<CENTER>
  <B>Now, please don't ask why, who knows what's the reason.</B>  
</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>It could be his heart wasn't working just right.</B>  </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>It could be, perhaps, that he wasn't too bright.</B>  </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>But I think that the most likely reason of all,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Is that both brain and heart were two sizes too small.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>In times of great turmoil, this was bad news,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>To have a government that ignores its Whos.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>But the Whos shrugged their shoulders, went on with their work,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Their duties as citizens so casually did shirk. </B> </CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They shopped at the mall and watched their T.V. </B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They drove a gas guzzling big S.U.V.,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Oblivious to what was going on in D.C.,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Ignoring the threats to democracy.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They read the same papers that ran the same leads,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Reporting what only served corporate needs.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>(For the policies affecting the lives of all nations</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Were made by the giant U.S. Corporations.)</B></CENTER>
<CENTER>Big <B>business grew fatter, fed by its own greed,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><B>And by people who shopped for the things they didn't need.</B></B></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>But amidst all the apathy came signs of unrest,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The Whos came to see we were fouling our nest.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And the people who cared for the ideals of this nation</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Began to discuss and exchange information:</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The things they couldn't read, in the corporate-owned news,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Of FTAA meetings and CIA coups,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Of drilling for oil and restricting rights.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They published some books, created Websites,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Began to write letters, and use their e-mail</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>(Though Homeland Security might send them to jail!)</B></CENTER>
<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/laptopwindows.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="90" ALT="laptopwindows.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>What began as a whisper soon grew to a roar,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>These things going on they could no longer ignore.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They started to rise up and reach out to all</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Let their voices be heard, they rose to the call,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>To vote, to petition, to gather, dissent,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>To question the policies of the "President."</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>As greed gained in power and power knew no shame</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The Whos came together, sang "Not in our name!"</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>One by one from their sleep and their slumber they woke</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The old and the young, all kinds of folk,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The black, brown and white, the gay, bi- and straight,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>All united to sing, "Feed our hope, not our hate!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop stockpiling weapons and aiming for war!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop feeding the rich, start feeding the poor!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop storming the deserts to fuel SUV's!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop telling us lies on the mainstream T.V.'s!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop treating our children as a market to sack!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop feeding them Barney, Barbie and Big Mac!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop trying to addict them to lifelong consuming,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>In a time when severe global warming is looming!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Stop sanctions that are killing the kids in Iraq!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Start dealing with ours that are strung out on crack!"</B></CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER><B>A mighty sound started to rise and to grow,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>"The old way of thinking simply must go!</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Enough of God versus Allah, Muslim vs. Jew</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>With what lies ahead, it simply won't do.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>No American dream that cares only for wealth</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Ignoring the need for community health</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The rivers and forests are demanding their pay,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>If we're to survive, we must walk a new way.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>No more excessive and mindless consumption</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Let's sharpen our minds and garner our gumption.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>For the ideas are simple, but the practice is hard,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And not to be won by a poem on a card.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>It needs the ideas and the acts of each Who,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>So let's get together and plan what to do!"</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/jesusresurrection.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="130" ALT="jesus.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>And so they all gathered from all 'round the Earth</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And from it all came a miraculous birth.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The hearts and the minds of the Whos they did grow,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Three sizes to fit what they felt and they know.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>While the Grinches they shrank from their hate and their greed,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Bearing the weight of their every foul deed.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>From that day onward the standard of wealth,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Was whatever fed the Whos spiritual health.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>They gathered together to revel and feast,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And thanked all who worked to conquer their beast.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>For although our story pits Grinches 'gainst Whos,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>The true battle lies in what we daily choose.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>For inside each Grinch is a tiny small Who,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>And inside each Who is a tiny Grinch too.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>One thrives on love and one thrives on greed.</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Who will win out? It depends who you feed!</B></CENTER>
