<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They ask him if he could arrange it so they could marry in heaven. St. 
Peter tells them that he'll do his best to work on it for them. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three months pass by and the couple hear nothing. They bump into St. 
Peter and ask him about the marriage. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He says, "<B>I'm still working on it.</B>" </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two years pass by and no marriage. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St. Peter again assures them that he's working on it. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally after twenty long years, St. Peter comes running with a priest 
and tells the couple it's time for their wedding. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The couple marry and live happily for a while. But after a few months 
the couple go and find St. Peter and tell him things are not working 
out, and that they want to get a divorce. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I><B>Can you arrange it for us?</B></I>" they ask. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St. Peter replies, "<B>Are you kidding?!! It took me twenty years to find a 
priest up here. How am I gonna find you a lawyer?</B>"</P>
