 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A subject which is rarely covered is that of ghosts on the railways - even though there's no 
reason to think there aren't any.  We were recently given a series of pictures by a work-
colleague of Liz's, and amongst them was a photo of a Royal carriage.  You can imagine our 
surprise when we discovered a <B>"passenger"</B>, which prompted an investigation to be held.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a few <B>"hit and miss"</B> attempts, we eventually logged on to the National Railway 
Museum site, and were astonished at what we saw.  The very first picture that came up was 
no less than the same person featured in the photograph we had received........ identified as 
no less than <B>Queen Victoria</B> !  </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A trick photo, or a double exposure? Well, it could be, but 
    we hold the evidence that Her Majesty has been photographed in the late 1990's, 
    seated in her personal coach (<I>which is too delicate for the public to view 
    internally</I>) on a Japanese camera with Japanese film. A close inspection 
    of the photo reveals that the figure is partly obstructed by the superstructure 
    and fittings, and in a correctly seated position!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time of the photo being taken, there were no pictures close by, and the photographer 
was alone - he wanted a picture of the coach's interior, and got the shock of his life when the 
film was developed !  Regretfully, he died recently, but his daughter has discovered an 
interest in this particular photo.  After all, it's not usual to have a personal picture of the 
Queen - from about a hundred years ago !</P>
