<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until now,  we've only covered standard gauge railway operations.  In this 
edition, I'll attempt to focus attention on the narrow gauge systems, of which 
the main line was fairly dependant for supplies of raw materials. By far a most 
important aspect of Britain's Industrial backbone, these scaled - down railways 
were, and still are, an important life-line to those residing close to one. No more 
so than in a few examples that I'll now give. We also have a story from Tom 
Knowles, a friend of ours involved in the restoration bid for 576, which we've 
covered recently, from the U.S.A.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The R.H.&D.Rly., set in the marshes of Kent, is a main line in miniature. The 
majority of their locos are based on Gresley A1 pacifics, interspersed with two 
Canadian Pacific locos and other continental designs. This would lead one to 
think that the instigator of the line was well travelled, and ordered locos to be 
built that had impressed Captain Jack Howey.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Duke of York drove the first train to New Romney, and the line even played 
it's part during WW2! Not only did they run an armoured train complete with 
anti-tank rifle and a pair of machine guns, but the R.H.&D.  provided an 
unexpected defence against the Lufftewaffe.  This was bought about by the 
physical size of the railway, which led German pilots within dangerous 
altitudes, thinking the railway to be of "normal size", and their instruments to 
be faulty.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Set against breathtakingly beautiful scenery, the narrow gauge railways of Wales 
make a most imposing sight. Despite the huge numbers of tourists that flock to 
see and ride these astonishing railways, the locals see them as a major form of 
transport.  There are many preserved lines, and all play their part in every day 
life, despite the demise of the slate industry that they once served.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something unusual about this line is that from it's conception in 1903, it had 
been intended for general usage, including passenger traffic. The line closed in 
1931, after succumbing to road transport, since which preservationists have re-
established the line; a job made more difficult after the bridge over the River 
Banwy was seriously damaged in storms that winter.</P> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A public responded to an appeal fund, and army engineers provided much 
needed help.</P>  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regretfully, the link with the Shrewsbury-Aberystwyth line, passing between 
the houses in Welshpool has been lost, due no doubt to insurance difficulties.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motive power on the line is now a strange mixture of continental locos and the 
two original tanks, The Earl and The Countess; all of which have a serious task 
with the 1 in 29 gradient out of Welshpool.  <B>For details and timetables, ring

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Operating from Aberystwyth to Devil's Bridge, this 1' 11" gauge railway was the 
last steam-operated line on the British Railway network until 1988, some twenty 
years after steam had left the B.R. main line system.  Purchased by the Brecon 
Mountain Railway, it was subsequently operated since April, 1989.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Livery of the coaching stock reveals the line's origins as being at one time 
G.W.R. property.  The line opened in 1902, and discovered a tourist potential 
from the word "Go". For much of the line's 11 3/4 miles, it clings to hillsides, 
and is best viewed in spring or mid-autumn.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Services run April and October-daily, except Monday and Friday; May-Saturday 
to Thursday; June to August-daily. <B>Further information is available by phoning

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This must surely stand proud in the plethora of preserved railways, being the 
first of a great many to run by volunteers in 1951, only a year after the inaugural 
meeting in Birmingham. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Talyllyn set a precedent around the world for a "living museum".  Whilst 
referring to museums, the Talyllyn has recently acquired lottery funding of 
£682,500 for an extension to Tywyn station, which will include a new site for the 
narrow gauge museum. It is hoped that the move will improve the visitor 
figures to the museum due to direct access from the trains.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2' 3" gauge line runs following the south side of the River Fathew, mostly 
contained by Snowdonia National Park, and provides access to the falls at 
Dolgoch and slate quarry workings. Motive power consists of seven radically 
differing locos, including the original two, and services provided are :- daily-late 
March to October, Sundays-mid February to late March.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unique in being Britain's only rack railway, the Snowdon Mountain Railway 
began operating on 6th April, 1896. That day transpired to be not a good one, as 
a loco de-railed and succumbed to the mountainside.  After the fitting of safety 
devices and another year, services resumed, and the line's safety record has 
since been un-blemished.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence of Swiss engineering can be found by a study of existing steam locos 
and pointwork, though the addition of four diesel locos from Hunslet of Leeds 
has provided a flexibility hitherto unknown to services in recent times.  A note 
here for the un-familiar; take warm clothing - the weather can be most 
changeable, and to ensure a seat, take the same train back from the summit (that 
gives a half-hour to view) ! A service runs daily from mid-March to the 
end of October. <B>Tel: 01286 870223.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the line's conception was primarily concerned with the production of slate, 
the Llanberris Lake Railway provides a chance to view the Welsh Slate Museum, 
which is to be found adjacent near Llanberris.  The motive power consists of 
three 1' 10 3/4" gauge steam locos, which once earnt their keep at Dinorwic 
Quarries, though the line was built on what was originally known as the Padarn 
Railway, originally constructed at 4' 0" gauge. Trains are run daily from April to 
September, and on selected days in March and October. <B>Tel: 01286 870549.</B></P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ffestiniog has in it's past made a significant impact in global railway history, 
having caught and held the interest of a Russian Tsar, Count Bobrinsky, who 
was in awe of the use of steam locos on a 1' 1 1/2" gauge railway-the first to do 
so in Victorian England.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A gentleman, one William Maddocks, constructed the "Cob"; a large 
embankment across the Traeth Mawr, creating a harbour later used as a dock for 
slate shipment at Portmadog.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Running between Portmadog and Blaenau Ffestiniog at a distance of 13 1/2 
miles, the Ffestiniog opened in 1836, using horses uphill, and gravity downhill, 
the horses travelling in 'dandy' wagons. The industrial revolution soon caused 
the manager, Charles Spooner  to commission London engineers George 
England & Co. to produce four miniature locos for the line - the first ever for 
commercial usage in that gauge. 1863 saw the first two arrive, the other two in 
1864. By 1865, the slate trade was slacking, and passengers were carried for the 
first time officially.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There's a mysterious attraction about a railway running alongside water, and 
none less so than the Bala Lake, which has proposed plans to extend at Bala. 
The plan involves a new station, due to the lack of access and facilities at the 
present terminus. Re-opened in 1972 in stages, the line covers 4 1/2 miles of 
trouble-free sightseeing around the lake, and the signal box, dated 1896, is 
usually open to the public.</P>

<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"All of engine management is deeply intriguing, including the waking of a 
sleeping beast. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coaxing an engine into steam and ready to go into a smooth start and managing 
the regulator and reverser are some things that require both a talent and 
practice. Until one has their hands on a Throttle (regulator) , it is unknown how 
much "pull" one must exert to get it to move, and when it moves, how much is 
enough? Every engine is a bit different, even of the same class.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you may have guessed, I have some engine experience, and  I will write 
down the memories of first trips and odd problems. Here is one in particular 
that tested my ability to the maximum one day. I had the down train in tow,  
and our rather heavy 0-4-0 T  (55 tons, US) managed to break a rail as we passed 
over a poorly supported section. The coaches came along nicely, as we were 
moving slowly at the time but the rail curled up against our return. I was totally 
unaware the rail had given way, but the rear guard saw it as we finished 
passing. The engine was such a noisy place, I never heard the report of it's 
having broken. I was advised upon reaching our destination. There was no 
passer (passing loop) at the end, so we had to push back up the hill.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On return up the hill, (about 1 in 50 here) I approached the spot marked by the 
dropping of a flag as we passed before gingerly, sitting on the edge of the cab 
window looking back. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hanging on to the throttle with one hand, and reaching around myself for the 
brakes was a contorted way to run a railroad. Our rear end crew landed on the 
ground equipped with pry-bars and blocks of wood, and signalled me to stop. 
Shortly, with hand signals I eased the train one wheel at a time over the broken 
section.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were some very tense moments as we had to move the train an inch at a 
time against steam and brake applications judging the moves by hand signals. 
Fortunately the damaged section was on the engineer's side. We had to 
orchestrate the special signals ahead of time for the unusual circumstances. I 
remember how particularly hard it was to gain an inch and hold it without 
gently coasting back down-grade as each wheel was coaxed across the break. It 
was some better as each coach, then the locomotive inched across the spot and 
the crew on the ground came closer and closer to me.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The heavy engine, with axle loadings of a BIG BOY were of particular concern 
especially since the wheels were worn past their limits and had very sharp and 
high flanges. Extra ties (sleepers) were wedged in under the breach to support 
the weight and we managed a clean get-away. Of course, this threw us way off 
schedule, but the riders were greatly relieved when they re-boarded on the other 
side and were saved from a long walk home. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Congratulations were in order and proffered with great earnest! Needless to say, 
operations for the rest of the day were suspended till a new rail could be 
installed and more ties inserted. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think I lost a few pounds due to sweat this day, as it was the middle of 
summer and the cab of a steam locomotive is hardly a cool place any time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much later, the engine had it's wheels refurbished due to another different but 
strange episode. That is another story, and a good one, too!  For lack of 
lubrication, one of the roller bearings on a driving axle decided to lock up at the 
half way point on a 6 mile run. Passengers were not so lucky that day. This is 
the "stranded" episode mentioned below. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent back-woods repair is an epic of its own in the telling, and 
constitutes the last official act of the steam shop lathe and press at Beech Grove, 
Indiana (Ex-New York Central) in the repair by replacement of the blown 
bearing and turning of the drivers to a renewed, FRA profile.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other such stories are "Flue sheet Breach", "Re-flueing at midnight", "Don't 
drink the number two Diesel fuel", "Stranded!", "Removal and repair of driving 
wheels", "Never study a pop (relief) valve at close range on a hot locomotive", 
Stuck whistle, no shut-off valve", "Balky air pump" come to mind. Interested?</P>
