<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just after dinner one night,  my son came up to tell me there  was
"something  wrong" with one of the two hamsters he holds  prisoner
in  his  room.  "He's just lying there looking sick," he told  me.
"I'm serious, Dad Can you help?"</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I put my best hamster-healer statement on my face and followed him
into  his bedroom.  One of the little rodents was indeed lying  on
his  back,   looking stressed.  I immediately  knew  what  to  do.
"Honey," I called,  "come look at the hamster!" Oh,  my gosh,"  my
wife diagnosed after a minute. "She's having babies."</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"What?"  my  son demanded.  "But their names are <B>Bert</B>  and  <B>Ernie</B>,
Mom!" I was equally outraged.  "Hey, how can that be? I thought we
said we didn't want them to reproduce," I accused my wife.  "Well,
what  do  you  want  me to do,  post a sign in their  cage,?"  she
inquired. (I actually think she said this sarcastically!)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"No,  but you were supposed to get two boys!" I reminded her,  (in
my  most  loving,   calm,  sweet voice,  while gritting  my  teeth
together).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Yeah, <B>Bert</B> and <B>Ernie</B>!" my son agreed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, ya know," she
informed me.  (Again with the sarcasm,  ya think?) By now the rest
of  the family had gathered to see what was going on.  I shrugged,
deciding to make the best of it.  "Kids,  this is going  to  be  a
wondrous  experience,  I announced.  "We're about to  witness  the
miracle of birth."</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"OH, Gross!", they shrieked.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Well THATS just Great!;  what are we going to do with a litter of
tiny little hamster babies?" my wife wanted to know.  (I really do
think she was being snotty here,  too.  don't you?)  We peered  at
the patient.  After much struggling,  what looked like a tiny foot
would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"We  don't  appear to be making much progress,"  I  noted.   "It's
breech," my wife whispered,  horrified.  "Do something,  Dad!"  my
son  urged.  "Okay,  okay." Squeamishly,  I reached in and grabbed
the  foot  when it next appeared,  giving it a gingerly  tug.   It
disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Should  I  call 911?" my eldest daughter wanted to know.   "Maybe
they  could  talk us through the trauma." (You see a pattern  here
with  the females in my house?)  "Let's get Ernie to the  vet,"  I
said grimly.  We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage  in
his  lap.   Breathe,  Ernie,  breathe," he urged.  "I don't  think
hamsters do Lamaze," his mother noted to him.  (Women  can  be  so
cruel to their own young. I mean what she does to me is one thing,
but this boy is of her womb, for God's sake.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered  at  the
little  animal through a magnifying glass.  "What  do  you  think,
Doc, a c-section?" I suggested scientifically.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Oh,  very interesting," he murmured. "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I
speak  to you privately for a moment?" I gulped,  nodding  for  my
son  to step outside.  "Is Ernie going to be okay?" my wife asked.
"Oh,   perfectly," the vet assured us.  "This hamster  is  not  in
labor.  In fact,  that isn't EVER going to happen...  <B>Ernie</B>  is  a
boy." "What!?" "You see,  <B>Ernie</B> is a young male. And occasionally,
as  they come into maturity,  like most male species,  they um....
er....  masturbate.  Just the way he did,  lying on his back."  He
blushed,  glancing at my wife.  "Well,  you know what I'm  saying,
Mr..Cameron."  We  were  silent,    absorbing  this.   So  <B>Ernie's</B>
just...just...Excited?", my wife offered.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"Exactly,"  the  vet replied,  relieved that we understood.   More
silence.   Then my vicious,  cruel wife started  to  giggle.   And
giggle. And then even laugh loudly.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"What's  so funny?" I demanded.  Tears were now running  down  her
face.   "It's  just...that...I'm picturing you pulling  on  its...
its...teeny  little..." she gasped  for  more  air  to  bellow  in
laughter once more. "That's enough," I warned.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We thanked the Veterinarian and hurriedly bundled the hamsters and
our son back into the car.  He was glad everything was going to be
okay.  "I know Ernie's really thankful for what you've done, Dad,"
he  told me.  "Oh,  you have NO idea," my wife agreed,  collapsing
with  laughter.  2 - Hamsters - 10 bucks...  1 - Cage -  20  bucks
Trip to the Vet ...30 bucks...  <B>Pictures of your hubby pulling  on
the hamster's wacker........Priceless!</B></P>
