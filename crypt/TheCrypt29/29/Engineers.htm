  To the optimist, the glass is half full.  <br> To the pessimist, the glass is half

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.<br></p>

  The graduate with a Science degree asks, &quot;Why does it work?&quot;<br>

  Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the possible designers 
  of the human body. One said, &quot;It was a mechanical engineer.   Just look 
  at all the joints.&quot; Another said, &quot;No, it was an electrical engineer.  
  The nervous system has many thousands of electrical connections.&quot; <br>
  <span lang=EN-US>The last one said, &quot;Actually it was a civil engineer. 
  Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?&quot;</span>

  An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better 
  to spend time with the wife or a mistress. The architect said he enjoyed time 
  with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship.<br>
  The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the passion &amp; 
  mystery he found there. The engineer said, &quot;I like both.&quot; Both?&quot; 
  <br>
  Engineer: &quot;Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress they will each assume 
  you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the workshop and 
  get some work done.&quot;<br>

  An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, 
  &quot;If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess.&quot; He bent over, 
  picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up again and said, 
  &quot;If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay 
  with you for one week.&quot; The engineer took the frog out of his pocket,  
  smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.   The frog then cried out, &quot;If 
  you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING 
  you want.&quot; Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it 
  back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, &quot;What is the matter? I've 
  told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do 
  anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?&quot;  The engineer said, &quot;Look 
  I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog ......that's 
  cool.&quot;<br>
