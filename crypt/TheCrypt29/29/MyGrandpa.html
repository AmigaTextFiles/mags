 <CENTER>Many, many years ago</CENTER>
<CENTER>When I was twenty three</CENTER>
<CENTER>I got married to a widow</CENTER>
<CENTER>Pretty as could be.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/bridegroomkissing.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="169" ALT="bridegroomkissing.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER> This widow had a grown up daughter</CENTER>
<CENTER>With flowing hair of red,</CENTER>
<CENTER>My father fell in love with her</CENTER>
<CENTER>And soon the two were wed.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>This made my dad my son-in-law</CENTER>
<CENTER>And changed my very life.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Now my daughter was my mother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>For she was my father's wife.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>

 <CENTER>To complicate the matters worse</CENTER>
<CENTER>Although it brought me joy,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I soon became the father</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of a bouncing baby boy.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER>My little baby then became</CENTER>
<CENTER>A brother-in-law to dad,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And so became my uncle,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Though it made me very sad.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>For if he was my uncle,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then that also made him brother</CENTER>
<CENTER>To the widow's grown up daughter,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who of course was my step-mother.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Father's wife then had a son</CENTER>
<CENTER>Who kept them on the run,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And he became my grandson</CENTER>
<CENTER>For he was my daughter's son.</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>My wife is now my mother's mother</CENTER>
<CENTER>And it makes me blue.</CENTER>
<CENTER>Because although she is my wife,</CENTER>
<CENTER>She's now my grandma too.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER> If my wife is my grandmother,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Then I am her grandchild.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And every time I think of it</CENTER>
<CENTER>It simply drives me wild.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/exclamationmark.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="70" ALT="exmark.gif"></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>For now I have become</CENTER>
<CENTER>The strangest case you ever saw,</CENTER>
<CENTER>As the husband of my grandmother,</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I am my own grandpa!</B></CENTER>
