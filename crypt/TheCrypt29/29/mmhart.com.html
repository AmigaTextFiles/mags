  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>WOW</B> ... This is one impressive web site. The sheer 
    size and different pages to view will ensure that you pay the site several 
    visits, and take my word for it, This site is well worth the time you will 
    spend viewing it.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Normally when you click on a URL and the site loads, you 
    can quickly judge whether it is a Personal or business site. However <A HREF="http://www.mmhart.com">www.mmhart.com</A> 
    seems to be a rare mixture of both. Yes there is a strong plug for their film 
    "In the Company of Men" coupled with a vast array of Downloads Amiga/PC/Commodore64 
    etc. and coupled with Personal Pictures of Mark's sons And even a Camper van. 
    However the whole site is very well laid out and blends in beautifully.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure you, clicking on <A HREF="http://www.mmhart.com">www.mmhart.com</A> 
    will ensure you spend the next hour or two frantically going from one page 
    to the next. Mark has even ensured you don't miss out on World events by including 
    a "News Headline" Banner.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This site contains a large collection of Downloads for the 
    older Amiga's (1000/2000/3000 etc). If you have one of these machines then 
    this site is heaven for you. I can't begin to list all the items covered on 
    this site, But lets have a brief preview of what you will find. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As  one of the executive producers for the film I thought I  would
post  some information on it.  Many people have asked me questions
about  the  film,  the writer/director,  and  other  things  so  I
thought I would answer them all here. (<A HREF="http://www.mmhart.com">www.mmhart.com</A>)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This  is  my  Amiga  Computers  page.   I've  been  involved  with
computers  ever since the 8th grade in school.  It was  the  first
time  that I ever got to use a computer (an Atari 800 to be exact)
and  I  was amazed by it.  Though we only got to use them for  two
weeks before they went to the next class it left an impression  on
me that will last my lifetime.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  saved  up my money and bought a Commodore 64 with a Tape  Drive
that  I cut my teeth on for a few years.  Then Commodore came  out
with their Amiga and it was the most amazing computer I have  ever
seen.   Though the Commodore 64 was a fine machine,  the Commodore
Amiga  was  something out of Star Trek.  Its  like  comparing  the
speed  of  sound  to the speed of light.  Both are impressive  but
nothing compares to light.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I  spent my last year of high school and almost all of the college
years on the Amiga.  I had every model that they made at one  time
or  another  and really learned programming and advanced  computer
theory  with the Amiga Computers.  Most of my friends  had  Amigas
and  together we hacked on the machine in just about everyway  but
mostly on the OS (<B>Kickstart and Workbench</B>).</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kickstart was Commodore's ROM that was more than a BIOS  but  less
than  an OS.  It contained all of the libraries and routines  that
all  the software used.  It was half an OS if you will,  and  then
other half being Workbench.  Workbench was the GUI part of the  OS
that  allowed  you  to  work  with applications  and  files.   The
coolest  part was the Kickstart (<B>though in ROM</B>)  could be software
loaded  into  memory and then rebooted to use the new  Kickstart. 
This  allowed  for  great  testing and modifications  of  the  ROM
without having to remove the old ROM and put a new one it.</P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though I am only giving you a tiny,  tiny list of what the OS  can
do,   its the size that's impressive.  For Kickstart is only  512k
(<B>256k  when it started out and then moved to 512k</B>)  and  Workbench
fit  on 1 low density disk.  When you compare that to today's OS's
its  unbelievable.  On top of all that you had  just  about  every
feature  in  Windows 2000 (<B>give or take a few</B>)  in  Kickstart  and
Workbench.  It was truly ahead of its time.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though I consider myself an OS junky (<B>trying every OS out  that  I
can  run</B>)  I think the AmigaOS is far and away the best OS  ever. 
Period.   Though I think Microsoft makes a good OS  (<B>Windows  2000
is  really impressive)</B>  and I make my living by that,  I think the
Amiga is history's best kept secret.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly,  through bad management Commodore went under and while  the
Amiga has lived on through its users,  it will take nothing but  a
miracle to put it in the race again for OS's. </P>
