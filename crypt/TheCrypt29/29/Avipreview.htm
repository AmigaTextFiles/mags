<p>If you use a P2P system and download movies with it, you’ll empathise with 
  this.</p>
<p>Movies come in lots of different formats, codecs, resolutions etc.</p>
<p>Some people seem to take great delight in renaming files as well. This can 
  make it quite a bit harder to track down that particular piece of footage you’re 
  looking for, and if the footage is an AVI file, you usually can’t preview it 
  to see its what you want until the download is finished. All of which can make 
  life very frustrating…</p>
<p>However……………..there are various workarounds to this. </p>
<p>I tried out Kazaa and Morpheus a while back and decided to retry them. Kazaa 
  has AviPreview bundled with it now. AviPreview is a GUI based program that plays 
  unfinished files with more than reasonable success. So you can attempt to play 
  the partial movies with it. It supports DivX, Xvid etc and makes a very good 
  job of trying to display fragments.</p>
<p>It can also be used on its own.</p>

<p>The latest version of the program can be downloaded at <a
href="http://www.avipreview.com/">http://www.avipreview.com</a> as can be seen 
  above. Basically the download is a couple of hundred Kb, so won’t cost any time 
  at all to download. It comes in a simple zip archive which you extract anyplace 
  you please. Starting the program, you get the GUI shown above. Select file, 
  tell it where the fragment is, and you get something like this…</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=287 height=324

<p>The bars show how much of the file you’ve downloaded and it does help if the 
  bars are equal. Even if they are not, AviPreview will attempt to render the 
  file and then play it. It won’t give the best picture quality, but it will enable 
  you to see if you are downloading the correct file you’re after…. and that’s 
  what we are trying to do.</p>
<p>The program is free to use, so why not try it out?</p>
<p>One of the other good points about the program is that if you go to the “Help” 
  menu and select “about”, it brings up a little browser in the screen. So the 
  news is fresh.</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=726 height=581

<p>As you can see, I am, at present, using an older version of the program.</p>
<p>While I was having a quick browse through the author’s site, I saw that he 
  mentioned that there was another program called AviPreview. It also gave the 
  address for it, so off I went. The address is <a
href="http://www.funkster.org/">http://www.funkster.org</a> as you will see in 
  the following grabs.</p>
<p>The author of this program claims that his is the original and is significantly 
  superior to AviPreview. So, of course, I had to try it as well…</p>
<p>The download for this one is another huge amount…less than one hundred k this 
  time. Isn’t it great when modem users don’t have to spend hours downloading 
  another piece of software?</p>
<p>Anyway, it is the same as the previous program, in that you simply extract 
  it from a zip archive wherever you want.</p>
<p>This one, however, doesn’t have a GUI and is console based. Yup, a Dos window!!!!</p>
<p>Ok, let’s show what happens………</p>
<p>Firstly, open a dos window and type in the command line.</p>
<p>The command line can have quite a few switches, but these are covered in the 
  readme file in the zip. </p>
<p>I didn’t find any need to use them.</p>
<p>I simply used the AviPreviewC inputfilename outputfilename  command line.</p>
<p>You can decide if you require any more than that.</p>
<p>I tried it with a file that AviPreview had played and that VirtualDub had also 
  managed to play. Did I mention that VirtualDub will do the same?</p>
<p> <img border=0 width=845 height=530
src="Images/avipreview4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028"> </p>
<p>Anyway, as you can see from the grab, the program went to work and wrote another 
  file (remember the command line?). As I said previously, I didn’t use the switches 
  and let the program try and discover the codec and audio for the file itself. 
  This worked well enough and I played a few partial files through that I had 
  tried on the other program. </p>
<p> <img border=0 width=810 height=508
src="Images/avipreview5.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"> </p>
<p>On my slow 750 MHz Athlon system, the program managed to write at about </p>
<p>1 meg/sec. Since this is rederiving the keyfiles etc, it certainly ain’t slow. 
  DivX player, WinAmp Media Player etc, could play the finished files. The files, 
  since they are only partial clips aren’t perfect, but again are acceptable to 
  show what exactly you are downloading.</p>
<p>The first AviPreview is very easy to use, and the second is also easy to use 
  if you are vaguely competent in using a command.</p>
<p>You takes your pick here. I personally preferred the first version, since it 
  uses a GUI and doesn’t write a second file. The second is probably a lot more 
  useful if you are dealing with corrupt files and trying to salvage from them.</p>
<p>Both are still being developed and the first one has lots more goodies planned 
  like caching the index files. </p>
<p>Give them both a download, they won’t take much room and you may find them 
  very useful!</p>
