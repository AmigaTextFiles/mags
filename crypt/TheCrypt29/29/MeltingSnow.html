<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm ready for Spring.  I've had enough snow for this year; I
figure that we got almost 5 feet at our house, and that's a
heckava lot of work and worry when you have two horses to
dig out.  I managed to keep their corrals clear with the
snow blower, but at one point during the winter the snow was
waist-high in their turn out area and they had no room to
move around.  So we hired a skip-loader to come in and plow
it out; after that they had room to walk (<B>surrounded by
10-foot walls of snow</B>)!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it fascinating to watch as the snow melts because you
can see how Mr. Sun has to work so much harder to melt some
parts of the snowpack than others.  There are several
variables (<B>air temperature, cloud cover, shade, snow depth,
and snow density</B>) and I have no control over the process.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As it turns out, I do.  There are certain areas on our
property that get dangerously muddy and slippery because the
melting snow is uphill from a traffic area.  How can I hurry
the process so it will dry out sooner?  Here's how:  I can
move the snow so that the runoff will flow away from the
critical area.  By doing so, I am helping the sun do its job
because <B>a)</B>, I can move it to a sunnier area and <B>b)</B>, when I
move it I break one large, dense pile of snow into smaller
pieces.  The sunnier area means that the sun can work on it
directly (<B>melting the snow with radiant heat</B>) rather than
indirectly (<B>through heating the air which, in turn will melt
the snow</B>).  Breaking the large pile into smaller pieces
allows the sun to reach more surface area of the snow,
attacking each piece separately instead of having to attack
one large piece all at once.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One particular pile was taking <B>FOREVER</B> to melt.  I shoveled
and threw it high in the air, so when it hit the driveway
pavement it would smash and spread all over, creating a
zillion little pieces to melt instead of one very large
pile.  An hour after I finished it had melted and
evaporated; there was no sign it had ever existed.  My guess
is that it would have taken a week for it to melt without my
"<I>help</I>".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And herein lies the lesson:  to complete a large project, it
helps to break it into smaller pieces.  Sometimes I get
overwhelmed when I have a large project to complete.
Overwhelm leads to anxiety, which leads to paralysis, which
leads to avoidance, which makes me more overwhelmed!  It's a
vicious circle.  <B>BUT...</B> if I break the big project into
smaller 'bite-size' chunks, I avoid the entire mental roller
coaster and stuff gets done.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a lesson in delegation as well.  If you are going to
give a large project to someone else, help them avoid being
overwhelmed by either assigning it in smaller pieces, or by
encouraging them to do it.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you have a large project to 'melt'?  Break it into pieces
and it will melt and evaporate in record time.</P>
