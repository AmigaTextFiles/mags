<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought I'd do some Spring Cleaning today;&nbsp;&nbsp;  not an easy task by any means, as I am a self-
confessed hoarder, and keep everything&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>"in case it comes in useful someday".</B></P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My son, who is at present in a small bedroom has requested 
    the use of the larger <B>"spare room"</B> which we had always eyed with the 
    intention of converting into a study to house our computer equipment and crafts. 
    &nbsp; At the moment it is stacked haphazardly with an unsorted collection 
    of "keepsakes" from both our parents' homes - so stacked that entry into the 
    room is impossible!&nbsp;&nbsp; Before clearing that room, space had to be 
    created in other places - hence the Spring Clean.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The son's room was fairly easy.  Start tidying and make a pile of <B>"outgrown"</B> and you can 
guarantee he'll argue and finish the job himself. Surprisingly, he hasn't kept too much of it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He must be growing up.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next job is our bedroom, and it's astonishing what you find hidden away.&nbsp;&nbsp;  With a pile of odd 
socks and general rubbish accumulating, I tidied the clothes into the wardrobe moving aside 
garments I keep for <B>"best".</B>&nbsp;  As the wardrobe started complaining and bulging alarmingly, a 
sort through was required. &nbsp; Trying on was in order to check the fit, and I was whisked away 
on a wave of nostalgia.&nbsp;  Memories came flooding back when the outfits were modelled, some 
happy, some sad, a christening, weddings, funerals, Christmas, evenings out with friends and 
family, and holidays.&nbsp;  Then there were the disasters, the clothes you wished you hadn't 
bought.&nbsp;  The kind that were a bargain and looked good in the shop, but get them home and 
they look terrible, and the outfits which are so old, they are sadly outdated and only fit for a 
museum.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three hours later I have a little space made in the wardrobe&nbsp; (<B>which is very thankful and no 
longer bulges and allows the door to shut</B>),&nbsp; and several piles of <B>"wanted, but can't wear"</B> 
clothes on the bed.  Further sorting results in a pile for mid twenties daughter, a pile for 
possible alteration, a pile definitely off to the charity shop, and yet another pile that I can't 
bear to discard even though they won't fit. &nbsp; I spend a few more hours agonising over those 
before deciding to return those to the ungrateful wardrobe.&nbsp;  They'll never fit, or look sensible 
again, but it's those memories attached that makes them special.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So guys, before you argue that your wife/girlfriend doesn't need any more clothes when she 
returns from a shopping spree, it's probably because she also has a collection of "memory 
clothes" which she can't possibly ever part with.&nbsp; Beware, this collection grows every year, 
despite hard bargaining from either you or anyone else.  Some do go, but others take their 
place.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>Sorry</B>, but it's just a <B>"woman thing"</B>. &nbsp; Remedy? &nbsp; Buy a bigger wardrobe!  I'm off to continue 
the Spring Cleaning - see you in a week or two.</P>
