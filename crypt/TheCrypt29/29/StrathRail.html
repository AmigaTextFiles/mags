<blockquote> <IMG SRC="Images/46512_1s.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="160" ALT="train.gif"><font color=aqua ALIGN="LEFT">The 
  Strathspey Steam Railway is based at Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands. With 
  the Cairngorm Mountains close at hand the area is a favourite tourist attraction 
  for its natural beauty and the wide range of outdoor pursuits that such an area 
  can offer.
  <p></P>
    You may remember travelling to school or work or going on holiday behind a 
  steam engine, when you were younger. You may be too young to remember when steam 
  ran the trains throughout the country.
  <p></P>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever your age come aboard The Strathspey Railway and 
    relive the sights and sounds of the steam age its part of your past, your 
    heritage. Join the train at the beautifully restored Aviemore Station, the 
    largest on the Highland Railway system outside Inverness. Pass the large locomotive 
    shed (not open to the public) built in 1897 which is the railways main workshop.</P>

  This is where the lines engines are lovingly restored and maintained by the 
  Company's craftsmen and volunteers of the Strathspey Railway Association, using 
  the traditional skills of the engineer. You may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse 
  of some of the other locomotives as you pass by. Once clear of Aviemore relax, 
  enjoy a snack or a dram or simply view the heather moorland and the Cairngorm 
  . Mountain range from the carriage window, scenes almost unchanged in a hundred 
  years. Arrive at Boat of Garten , a village created by the coming of the old 
  railway companies that served the area. See the driver and fireman tend to their 
  engine. They may take on water and the fireman will prepare his fire for the 
  next journey.

<font color=yellow><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AVIEMORE<font color=aqua> station is now in the main street of the village opposite the Cairngorm Hotel . Access to the Strathspey Railway Platform is by the footbridge from the main road. Access can also be made from Dalfaber Road where there is also a ramp and is suitable for those with walking difficulties, wheelchairs, baby carriages etc. Car drivers wishing to use this entrance will need to drive to the south end of Aviemore and turn into the Coylumbridge Cairngorm road (the ski road), cross the railway bridge and take an immediate left turn into Dalfaber Road. Don't go as far as to cross the River Spey. Continue along past the Old Bridge Inn until you see the entrance to the Steam Railway on the left. The station car park is operated as a one way traffic system.</font></P>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Many of the people you will see running the Railway are volunteers who are Members of the Strathspey Railway Association. Whilst there is a strong contingent of Members from the Central Belt, the North East and the Inverness areas of Scotland, the Railway enjoys strong support from Members in England. Many visit the line every month to take part in running the service, working on the track, coaches and locomotives. Members from around the World, notably from Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand have been known to take a working holiday on the Railway.</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As mentioned above, there are many facets to running the Railway - Operational (train crew and commercial), Locomotive and Rolling Stock Maintenance, Civil Engineering (track and structures), Signals and Telegraph (S&T) or special projects. Each day that the Railway is running the following posts require to be filled - Locomotive Driver, Fireman, Guard, Ticket Inspector, Booking Clerks (2), Shop Assistants (2) and General Station Staff (2).</P></font>

<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Members receive a quarterly journal and may purchase reduced rate tickets (currently 75% reduction) to travel. Full details are available from the Membership Secretary or at the stations. To help volunteers run the Railway the Association runs a hostel which provides "youth hostel" accommodation at very modest rates.</P></font>





<font color=aqua><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Association helps to raise funds for various projects on the Strathspey Railway including the planned extension to Grantown-on-Spey. Even if you are unable to offer practical help you will be very welcome to join our world-wide membership.
