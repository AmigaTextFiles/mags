<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been a couple of scams circulating around on the Internet recently, 
which are 
worth a warning.  <B>This is one of them.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I received an e-mail recently advising me I had won a great deal of money on 
the UK 
International Lotto, and instructions on how to obtain my winnings.  Our young 
lad was first 
to open the e-mail, having sorted through the incoming mails.  We can get an 
enormous 
amount of mail through our mailbox, as we are members of several mailing lists, 
including 
our own<FONT COLOR=RED> Crypt<FONT COLOR=BLACK> mailing list, of course.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He finally got my attention when he asked how much US$2,500,000 amounted 
to in UK 
sterling.  When I queried why he wished to know, he told me that's how much 
I had won on 
this lotto.  A quick double take and he insisted I read the mail.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How gullible you are depends on your age and circumstances.  He was taken in, 
hook, line 
and sinker, but then, he is only 11.  I'm much older, and have the experience of 
the <B>"life of 
hard knocks"</B>, and explained one of my adages.  "<B>If it sounds too good to be 
true, it usually 
is"</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was all for responding, but was finally persuaded to wait until I had 
investigated further.
I had applied for nothing, anywhere.  I am careful when accepting cookies when 
on-line, only 
doing so when it is absolutely necessary, so the e-mail address does not get 
spammed often.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This e-mail had all the hall-marks of spam about it, but it did intrigue me.  The 
header 
showed around 50 e-mail addresses around the world, all beginning with the 
same letter of 
the alphabet as mine, indicating some sort of address trawling had taken place. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just to be on the safe side, I did an Internet search on international lotteries 
which threw up a 
huge selection of sites, some genuine and some questionable.  Then I spotted 
one which 
mentioned a scam and followed the links.  Once reading through the pages, I 
spotted the 
address for the claim which I had received.  It was the same address, a different 
name but 
enough of a coincidence to prompt a further read. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apparently, once you contact them, they will send a form for you to fill in with 
details of 
your bank account and a request for varying amounts circa 5,000 Euros to enable 
you to 
obtain your <B>"winnings"</B>. </P> 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you receive one of these mails - <B>DO NOT REPLY OR FILL IN ANY FORMS 
OR SEND ANY 
MONEY.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will never see any "winnings" or your money again.  In the worst scenario, 
your bank 
account will be "milked", leaving you seriously out of pocket.  </P>
