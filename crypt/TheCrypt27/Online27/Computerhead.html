<FONT COLOR=NAVY><CENTER><B>Selecting A Word</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are using a mouse, there's a shortcut you can use to select an entire 
word. To do this, follow these two steps:</P>

1. Using the mouse pointer, point to the word you want to select. <BR>
2. Double-click on the mouse.<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to select additional words, don't release the mouse button after 
the second click -  just drag the mouse across them. You'll add one word at a 
time to your selection. Once the words are selected, you can do any other 
editing function on those words.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you need to replace text in a document, the usual procedure is to select 
the text, press Delete (<I>or Backspace</I>), and then type in the new text. Here's 
a great shortcut:</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">You don't have to erase the text at all. All you have to do 
is start typing and your new text will automatically replace the selected 
text.</P>


<CENTER><I>These techniques work in most programs.</I></CENTER>

<BR><FONT COLOR=BLACK><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most  <B>Windows</B>  programs  allow you to print  part  of  a  document
instead  of  the whole thing.  To print part of a page,  highlight
the  part  you  want to print by moving the mouse pointer  to  the
beginning of the section,  holding down the left mouse button, and
moving  the  mouse to the end of the selection.   Make  sure  it's
still highlighted - the text will be white on a dark background.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Click  on  File  to  open the menu,  click on Print,   and  choose
Selection in the Page Range area of the dialog box.  Click the  OK
or Print button.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In  some  programs,  the Selection choice may not be in the  first
Print  dialog  box.  In that case,  look for a  button  that  says
Options.  Click on it;  you should find the Page Range area in the
resulting dialog box.  Click the OK or Print button.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Only the part of the document that you highlighted will print.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An  alternative  to using the Selection feature  is  to  Copy  and
Paste  the  text in your word processing program,  and then  print
from there.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">To  do  this,   highlight the text that you want to print.   Click
Edit  on  the  menu,  and then click Copy.  Switch  to  your  word
processing  program.   Click Edit on the  menu,   and  then  click
Paste.   The  highlighted text will appear in the word  processing
document.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Advantages  to copying text into a word processing  document:   if
you  want to print two or more nonconsecutive areas of a document,
you  can  copy  each  block  of  text into  your  word  processing
program,  then only have to print the word processing document one
time.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Special  Note for AOL users:  AOL currently has a  bug  in  this
feature  where  the text highlighting is removed  by  opening  the
Print  dialog box.  There is a very lengthy fix for this,   but  a
simpler way would be to Copy and Paste the text you want to  print
into your word processing program, then print from there.</P>
