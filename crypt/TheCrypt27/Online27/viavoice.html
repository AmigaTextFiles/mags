<p><font size="+1">I received a copy of Via Voice free with Computer Shopper issue 
  178, so I thought I`d try it out and tell you what I thought of it. It says 
  you can do 140 words per minute on it, but being a bit of a sceptic I expected 
  to speak slowly, one word at a time into the mic, but I was pleasantly surprised 
  to find it very easy to use even straight from the box.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"> Setting up and using Via Voice I found very easy, and so far 
  I've been using it for about an hour and it seems to have found my voice easy 
  to understand. With Via Voice speak pad it has a correction window which helps 
  it to understand your Voice if it makes any mistakes, you have an option to 
  read to it and hear it played back to see if understands you correctly.The more 
  you use it the easier it is for it to understand your Voice. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">With the last paragraph I only had to correct two mistakes 
  it made which is very good considering I`ve only  been using it for a short 
  time. When you run Via Voice for the first time the wizard comes up and helps 
  you set up the programme, in there you are given several options on which type 
  of microphone to use, as I already had a microphone I was able to use that, 
  but the full version comes with a good quality headset, so you have everything 
  you need straight from the box. Part of the Wizard involves reading several 
  articles so the computer can get used to your Voice, this can take about an 
  hour so leave plenty of time when you set this up for the first time. You can 
  skip that bit and start using it straight away but until it gets used to your 
  voice it is bound to make some mistakes, so it`s well worth spending the time 
  and effort setting it up correctly.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">As you can see, this product could save people like me who 
  type slowly a lot of frustration. Also don`t forget it spells everything correctly 
  as it types, saving you more time and effort. And now that the newer versions 
  even let you control your E-mail and web browsing without touching the keyboard, 
  this programme is invaluable to those who have trouble typing or are disabled.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So for the price of around &pound;35 including a pair of good 
  quality headphones, this is a very reasonable buy, that could save you a lot 
  of time and may even stop you taking a hammer to your keyboard in frustration.</font></p>
