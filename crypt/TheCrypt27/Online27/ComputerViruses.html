<P ALIGN="LEFT">Worms,   trojan horses,  macro viruses,  boot sector viruses....it
can  be  rather  dangerous  to  be a  computer  user  these  days,
especially  if  you  share  data with  other  people  or  download
software  from  the Internet.  The danger isn't  exactly  targeted
towards you,  but towards your data,  which, in some cases, can be
destroyed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  virus is just a computer program.  Like any other program,   it
contains  instructions that tell your computer what  to  do.   But
unlike an application,  a virus usually tells your computer to  do
something  you  don't want it to do,  and it  can  usually  spread
itself  to  other  files  on  your  computer--and  other  people's
computers.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">A  virus  is  a  program or piece of code (<I>computer instructions</I>)
that is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and  runs
against your wishes.  Viruses can be hidden in executable  program
files  posted  online,  secreted in mail  attachments  or  can  be
distributed in other ways.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">If  you're lucky,  a virus will execute only a benign personality
quirk,   such  as  causing your computer to make seemingly  random
bleeps.  But a virus can also be very destructive; it could format
your hard drive,  overwrite your hard drive boot sector, or delete
files and render your machine inoperable.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most  viruses  can  also replicate themselves.   They  can  spread
swiftly  across  open  networks such  as  the  Internet,   causing
billions  of  dollars worth of damage in a short amount  of  time.
All computer viruses are manmade.  A simple virus that can make  a
copy  of itself over and over again is relatively easy to produce.
Even such a simple virus is dangerous because it will quickly  use
all available memory and bring the system to a halt.  An even more
dangerous  type  of  virus is one capable of  transmitting  itself
across networks and bypassing security systems.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Since 1987,  when a virus infected <B>ARPANET</B>,  a large network  used
by  the  Defense Department and many universities,  many antivirus
programs have become available.  These programs periodically check
your computer system for the best-known types of viruses</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some people distinguish between general viruses and worms.  <B>A worm</B>
is  a  special  type of virus that can replicate  itself  and  use
memory, but cannot attach itself to other programs.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>A  Trojan  horse</B>  is a destructive program that masquerades  as  a
benign  application.   Unlike   viruses,   Trojan  horses  do  not
replicate themselves but they can be just as destructive.  One  of
the  most insidious types of Trojan horse is a program that claims
to  rid  your  computer of viruses but instead introduces  viruses
onto your computer.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  term  comes  from a story in Homer's Iliad,   in  which  the
Greeks  give  a  giant wooden horse to their foes,   the  Trojans,
supposedly  as a peace offering.  But after the Trojans  drag  the
horse  inside their city walls,  Greek soldiers sneak out  of  the
horse's  hollow  belly  and open the city gates,   allowing  their
fellow soldiers to pour in and capture Troy.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>A  macro  virus</B> is a type of computer virus that is encoded  as  a
macro**  embedded  in  a  document.  Many applications,   such  as
Microsoft Word and Excel,  support powerful macro languages. These
applications allow you to embed a macro in a document,   and  have
the macro execute each time the document is opened.  According  to
some estimates,  75% of all viruses today are macro viruses.  Once
a  macro virus gets onto your machine,  it can embed itself in all
future  documents  you  create  with the  application.   Antivirus
programs  can  protect  your system against  most  macro  viruses,
although  new  ones  are always being created  that  slip  by  the
antivirus filters.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> **a  macro is a symbol,  name,  or key that represents a list  of
commands,  actions,  or keystrokes.  Many programs  allow  you  to
create macros so that you can enter a single character or word  to
perform  a  whole series of actions.  You can also use  macros  to
enter words or phrases that you use frequently.  For example,  you
could  define a macro to contain all the keystrokes  necessary  to
begin a letter -- your name,  address, and a code that inserts the
current date.  Then,  whenever you write a letter,  you just press
the macro key to include the letter header.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Boot sector infecting viruses </B>are one of the most common types  of
viruses around.  A boot sector is a special location on all disks,
hard  or  floppy,   where the Basic In/Out  System  (<B>BIOS</B>)   of  a
computer  looks during the booting of a computer  for  a  bootable
system.   The  boot  sector  of a disk  stores  instructions  that
identify  the  partition  on  a  disk,   contains  startup  files,
etc.Boot  sector viruses put viral code (<I>instructions</I>)   into  the
boot  sector of a disk.  When the computer is booted (<I>turned  on</I>),
the  viral  code is executed,  putting the virus into  memory  and
infecting the hard drive master boot sector.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once  infection of the master boot record of the hard disk  occurs
the  virus is run in memory each time the computer is booted  from
the  hard  drive.  All disks used on the computer from that  point
forth  have their boot sector infected with the virus code.   This
leads  to  proliferation  to other systems  or  reinfection  of  a
cleaned computer at a later date.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are ways to protect your computer from viruses.  First, read
this  article  to understand what viruses are and how  they  work.
Second,   equip your computer with a reliable anti-virus  software
program.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Anti-virus  programs  come  with  a  database  of  information  on
thousands  of  known viruses.  The program looks through  all  the
data  on  your hard drive to see if anything matches a pattern  in
that  database.  Since new viruses are constantly appearing,   you
must  update  your anti-virus program regularly.  Most  anti-virus
software  publishers release updates to their software  containing
information  on  new viruses every few months.  By  downloading  a
small  driver  file used with the software,  you'll  have  maximum
protection against new viruses and Trojan Horse programs.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">A  Trojan  Horse  is a program that appears to  perform  a  valid
function  but  contains,  hidden in its code,   instructions  that
cause  damage (<I>sometimes severe</I>)  to your computer.  Trojan  Horse
programs  may  compromise the security  of  an  Internet  account,
contain  objectionable graphics,  or cause damage to your computer
files.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not  all  anti-virus  software programs protect  you  from  Trojan
Horse  programs.   However,  you can  easily  avoid  Trojan  Horse
programs  by <B>NEVER</B> downloading a file attached to an  e-mail  from
someone  you  don't  know.   Some email providers,   for  example,
America Online,  helps you remember this with an automatic warning
system.   If  you start to download a file type that is  typically
associated with Trojan Horse programs,  you will receive a warning
message.   You  may then decide to proceed with  the  download  or
cancel it. If you don't know the sender, don't download the file!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are thousands of viruses in circulation.  Here are some tips
to protect your from infecting your computer:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Don't Take E-mail from Strangers:  Despite rumors you may  have
heard,  you can't catch a virus by reading e-mail or participating
in an Instant Messag conversation.  You can,  however, get a virus
if  you  download an infected file attached to an e-mail  message.
Here's  a  simple  rule:   If you don't know  the  sender,   don't
download  the  attachment  -- no matter  how  interesting  it  may
appear to be.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Watch the Net:  Exercise caution if you download files from the
Internet  (<I>either  via the World Wide Web or</I>  <B>FTP</B>).   Look  for  a
statement at the site saying that its files have been  checked  by
an  anti-virus program.  Downloading from a legitimate  site  that
checks  its files for viruses is likely to be safe.  If the  files
haven't been checked,  or if you're not sure, then either download
the  file  to  a floppy disk and check it with your own anti-virus
software or don't download from that site at all.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Spread  the Word:  Sure,  you practice safe surfing,  but  what
about  the  other members of your household? You can't watch  your
teenager every minute.  Will the allure of a new program  or  game
be  more  than they can stand? Will they download a file and  then
run  it  before scanning it with an anti-virus program? Share  the
information  in this area with other members of  your  family  and
have  a  discussion  about how to keep  your  computer  safe  from
viruses.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">* Check your Floppies:  Another way viruses spread is by infecting
floppy disks.  If you bring work home from the office,  you  could
bring  a  virus home,  too.  Scan all your floppies to  make  sure
they're  safe.   (You  might  also  consider  e-mailing  files  to
yourself at home instead of bringing them via floppy disk.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Back  it Up:  The best way to protect the data on your computer
is  to  back it up on a regular basis.  There are lots of  back-up
options  available  these days,  from tape cartridges  to  special
high  capacity disks.  If a virus slips through your defenses,   a
back-up will let you replace files destroyed by the infection.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">*  Stay  Current:  Because new viruses are being created  all  the
time,   you've got to keep your anti-virus software  up  to  date.
Look  for updates containing information on new viruses  from  the
software's publisher.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> * Arm Your Computer:  Of course, the best way to protect yourself
against viruses is to be armed with potent anti-virus software.</P>

 <CENTER><B>If you think you have a virus, follow this checklist:</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">1.<FONT COLOR=BLACK>   Stop  using the computer:  You should never try to do  normal
work on an infected computer.  Don't try to delete files you think
may  be infected -- it's unlikely that you'll get rid of the virus
that  way.   If  possible,  exit all your programs  and  shut  the
computer down normally, don't just hit the "off" switch.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">2. <FONT COLOR=BLACK> Don't use any floppy disks:  Don't risk spreading the virus to
someone  else.   Many  viruses are transferred  from  computer-to-
computer on floppy disks.  Never put a floppy into a computer  you
think may be infected.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">3.<FONT COLOR=BLACK>   Confirm the presence of a virus,  then get rid of  it:   Just
because you're having a problem doesn't mean your computer  has  a
virus.  You may have a hardware problem.  No matter what,   run  a
virus-checking program to identify and remove any viruses.  For an
extra-added  measure  of security run two  different  programs  --
anti-virus  programs recognize different viruses and hunt  viruses
in different ways.  Running two programs will help insure that the
virus is removed.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=RED><P ALIGN="LEFT">4. <FONT COLOR=BLACK> Scan all floppy disks:  If you've confirmed the presence of  a
virus,  scan all your floppy disks with the anti-virus software to
make  sure they're not infected too.  You wouldn't want  to  clear
out the virus only to have a floppy re-infect your computer!</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
