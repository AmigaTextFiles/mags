<p>I've used UAE for quite a while now but always found it difficult to set up 
  and run. Which was why I used Amiga in a box (AIAB) for quiet a while, but that 
  tends to be very limiting in what you can do, but it does save the hassle of 
  having to set the emulator up. So I was very glad to get hold of Cloanto's Amiga 
  forever at the World Amiga show in November.</p>
<p>I've found this the easiest emulator or to use. For a start you have all the 
  Amiga ROM's from 1.3 up to 3.1 included in the package plus with Cloanto's launcher 
  its just one click to launch whichever version of the OS you want to use.Got 
  any older games you want to play? No problem with Amiga Forever, just load up 
  OS 1.3 and run the adf's of all your favourite games. And just press ALT/F4 
  to quit back to the Windows screen.</p>
<p>Another thing I found with this program was you can insert a CD when the program 
  is running which you can't do with AIAB. With AIAB you have to insert the CD 
  before you start the program, but with Amiga forever you can insert a CD at 
  any time and will pick it up no problem. The only thing I did find doing it 
  this way was the program won't let you install from the CD without first making 
  an assign. The way I got round this was make an assign in the S:User-startup.</p>

<p> Straight out of the box it looks like the picture above, with it's own icon 
  bar at the bottom of the screen. But every Amigan I`ve ever met likes their 
  machine set up to their own likes, and it didn`t take me long to install Opus 
  Magellan and get it running the way I like it.</p>
<p>This version of UAE includes the Just-in-time version of emulation software 
  (Bernd Meyer's JIT code), carefully configured and publicly benchmarked by Cloanto 
  to be 30 times faster than in previous versions of Amiga Forever. The Amiga 
  runs in a window or in full screen mode, makes full use of thousands of Windows 
  (or other OS) drivers, can access PC files (even on NTFS partitions, in the 
  Windows version) and does not require a reboot. <br>
</p>
<p>Another piece of software that comes with the CD is Amiga Explorer which with 
  a NULL-Modem cable or via Ethernet (not supplied) let's you move all your favourite 
  stuff from your Amiga over to the PC.</p>

<p> Preinstalled software includes: Personal Paint 7.1b (paint, animation and 
  image processing software, includes GIF/LZW license), DirDiff (file synchronization 
  and replication software), AmiToRTF (to convert texts from Amiga to Windows 
  formats), MailBX (to convert Amiga mail archives to Microsoft Mail, Outlook 
  Express and Exchange Server), drag-and-drop LhA, print spooler (easily print 
  all Amiga documents under Windows, bypassing parallel port emulation), Directory 
  Opus 5.5 (courtesy of GPSoftware), TurboText (exclusive latest version with 
  stack problem fix), KingCON, ToolManager, etc. 
<p>The CD also includes some MPEG-1 videos: The Deathbed Vigil (one hour and 58 
  minutes, i.e. the full version of this "must have" video) and Jay Miner Speech 
  (49 minutes)
<p>So as you can see, this CD is everything you need to run a very fast Amiga 
  on your PC. And because Amiga Forever is so versatile, setting up the emulator 
  to your own needs is very easy. So I would definitely recommend you going out 
  and getting the CD because your old Amiga won`t last forever, and this way you 
  can run the Amiga OS on new hardware and still run all your favourite programs 
  and games.
