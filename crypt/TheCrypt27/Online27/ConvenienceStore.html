<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Convenience Store -</B> the corner shop.  Everyone's got one, quite local to them, 
usually on the corner of the road.  Always there, always open, except when you run 
out of milk at 2am or the cat's just come in and wants feeding, then they're closed.  
We take them for granted, and then moan when they close down because the new 
supermarket that opened recently that's about 2 miles away, has taken all the 
custom, and they can't afford to compete and stay open.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's not easy to run a little corner shop - ask anyone who's tried it, and they'll tell 
you all about it.  I know, I manage one.  Let me give you an example of a typical 
working day.  Do I hear you say <B>"That's boring"</B>?  <I>Not likely</I>.  Just try this for size.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The shop opens from 7am until 10pm at night, every day, seven days a week, all 
year round.  There's no rest for the wicked - just that I'd like the opportunity to be 
wicked once in a while.  <B>:-)</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Things have been ticking along nicely just lately, which is usually a precursor to 
something happening.  I was at a loss for anything to write about this time, and 
was ready to say - <B>"nothing to report"</B>, but the gremlins have decided otherwise.  
Nothing too serious, you understand, but, afterwards quite funny.  See for yourself.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With certain misgivings, I decided to have a week's holiday.  If you've been 
following this column, you will know what happened last time I tried for a break - 
we had a robbery!  No news on that one, I'm afraid, accept the whole thing seems 
very strange, and very typical of <B>"it could only happen to us"</B>.  It seems the guy 
responsible, who managed to circumvent our electronic keypad door lock to the 
back of the shop, robbed us of the day's takings, and calmly walked away, 
attempted suicide immediately afterwards.  He is known to the local police and 
apparently this is his customary behaviour.   No money was found on him or at his 
address, so there is no proof it was him, either, although he claims responsibility for 
it.  So you can see the reason for the apprehension, but, I'm pleased to say that a 
week's break went without a hitch.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Duly rested and refreshed, I returned to work and picked up the reins again.  The 
staff (<I>all credit to them</I>), had managed well, the shop hadn't fallen down, and no 
staff had left, and we could show good takings for that week.    On opening the 
shop that first morning, I commented that I thought I could smell something 
burning, but I was informed that the smell had been present for a few days, and 
must have been due to a neighbour having had a bonfire in the middle of the 
previous week.  I found nothing unusual happening to any equipment or stock in 
the area where the smell was the strongest, so I accepted the reasoning.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">During the day, the burning smell seemed intermittent, worse some times more 
than others, so, being a curious person, investigation was required.  After a few 
hours, I tracked the smell down to the milk chiller, and the smell was at it's worse 
during a defrost cycle.  I put it down to a dusty heater, maybe, which was probably 
used during defrost.  In the evening, I went home, not mentioning my findings to 
the staff, as they all seemed accustomed to the smell.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A few hours later, the phone rang.  All I could hear was the sound of a high 
pitched alarm.  Eventually, after much shouting, I could hear one of my supervisors 
trying to compete against the noise.  It appeared that the fire alarm had been set 
off by the smell, and, as the fire brigade had arrived, and found nothing wrong, 
they wished to reset the alarm, and she didn't know how. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">This alarm is new, fitted 
around 6 months ago, and although we test it and have practise drills, we have 
never needed to reset it.  I abandoned everything, and rushed to the shop. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The 
firemen were disassembling the light fittings in the shop trying to find the source of 
the smell, having been unable to find anything visible which could have activated 
the alarm, and not wishing to log a false alarm.  After explaining that I thought I 
knew what the problem was, they did reassemble the light fittings and I tried to 
reset the alarm. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Silence was brief and it took us a while to understand why it 
would not reset permanently - one of the girls had used one of the "break glass to 
call fire brigade" gadgets on the walls.  When this happens, the alarm waits for 30 
seconds and then sounds again.  As I had no replacement glass available, a piece of 
cardboard had to be utilised instead. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> The firemen checked the chiller, which was 
just below the smoke detector which had been triggered, and agreed that it was the 
possible cause.  They switched it off and left, leaving us speedily transferring all the 
milk and yoghurts to the other chiller, to prevent deterioration.  It looked a mess, 
but at least the stock (<I>and customers</I>) were safe.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On viewing the CCTV, primarily for any visible signs of smoke from the suspect 
chiller, it was gratifying to watch the staff following the procedures faultlessly, but 
amusing to see the consternation on their faces as they thought about summoning 
the fire brigade.  It never occurred to them to dial 999 from the shop phone but, 
the phone receiver was used to hammer the <B>"break glass"</B> until it broke. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Satisfied, 
the staff left the shop to stand outside near the door until assistance arrived.  
Customers stood with them to watch, thinking they could see the shop burn down!  
One or two of these customers had been shopping in the store, and had exited with 
the goods, unpaid for.  It took a few minutes before it occurred to them, and they 
hurriedly departed with their <B>"free goods"</B>!  Thanks a bunch, whoever you were, 
you rotten lot.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The staff were very disappointed that they lost around an hours trade, as the off-
licence just over the road to us, had closed early that night, and they were hoping 
for an upturn in sales of alcohol for the evening.  The reason for their early closure 
was that the manager had been locked in the office by two customers, whilst, it was 
thought, they robbed the place.  She phoned the police, who came to release her!  </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">On checking her CCTV coverage though, nothing had been taken!  No stock seems 
to be missing, all the takings were still in the till, and although the two men had a 
good look at all the shelves, they took nothing with them.  She is still puzzled as to 
why the men locked her in the office.  She's not the only one.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I called the chiller repair company the following day, who sent two men to check 
out the chiller.  On inspection, it was discovered that a fan motor was stiff, and 
covered with dust.  When the fans start during the defrost cycle, the fan motor ran 
hot, heating the dust.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"No cause for alarm, then?" </B> I asked.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Well, yes.  You were probably around 20 minutes away from a fire.  Good job you 
switched it off when you did."</B>  they replied.  I made a hurried exit, thankful I still 
had a store to run (<I>and a job, of course</I>).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It didn't stop there,  Oh no.  Today, just a few days after the alarm escapade, one 
of the tills started behaving strangely, shutting itself down without reason.  No 
problem, just restart it, I thought.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well, I did just that - twice!  Now the printer shows an error light, and the screen 
informs me there is an unknown printer error.  I know it's unknown - I can't find 
anything wrong with it.  I walk away thinking it will stay off, and I'll call an 
engineer tomorrow, when the cashier calls me back.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"There was a bang!"</B> she said.  <B>"I was just serving a customer, when the monitor fell 
off"</B>  There is the monitor, face down on the counter, luckily unbroken.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"I guess it's out of use, then."</B>  I said.  I will have to call the engineer now.  I just 
wanted to go home as I'd been there for 11 hours, being short staffed, with three 
on holiday, and having had a very large stock delivery to put out single-handed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When I went to get my coat, I found the supervisor had made me a bed by the 
back door, using wine crates, a toilet roll for a pillow and cage wrap as a blanket!  
I guess they're trying to tell me something here.  I take the hint and call it a day.  
I'll sort it all out tomorrow.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At least I know I'm not the only one having a bad day.  Just as I'm putting my 
jacket on, the PC <B>"pings"</B> to inform me I have been sent an e-mail.  I decide I'll just 
take a look, in case it's something urgent.  When I stop laughing, I show it to the 
others, who can't help but laugh too.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Message reads:</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>'To the Area Manager</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Just to let you know that Wages have paid an ex-employee, who only worked for 
me for two weeks, an amount of £10003.40 leavers pay, minus holiday accrued of 
£87.02, so gross pay of £9916.38.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>I have been in touch with Wages, who say it is not right but they cannot get into 
their system until this afternoon when they will ring me back.</I></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>I'll let you know more when I know more.'</I></P>

imagine how they can get that back - if it's their mistake.  </P>
