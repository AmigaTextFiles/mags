<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=Navy>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> What I do:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I am currenty employed as an englishteacher at a local highschool, after quitting another job as a history/psychology-teacher, and so on and so on. I like change. Even though I work full-time at the moment, I am engaged in a lot lots of projects and exercises in futility, and creativity.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=Navy>What I am:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I am a listener. Pure and simple. I listen to what people have to say, and always try to help those in need. I like to help people, as it teaches me a lot about them, and about me. I try to understand what people are saying, and try to help them to the best of my abilities. This sometimes gets me into trouble, as they ask for things I can not give without hurting someone else. Those are the greatest challenges of my life, and challenges confirms that you are alive. I also turned vegetarian few years ago, this being due to many things.<BR>
I believe that Anything that happens, happens.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=Navy> <P ALIGN="LEFT">What I like:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I like listening to people, and I like to help them in any way I can.<BR>
I also like all sorts of music, from serenity to new age, from techno to pop, rock to metal, rave to classic, hip-hop to country.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I am a great fan of Star Wars. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I also play a lot of role-playing games, everything from Vampire - the Masquerade, to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, and back. I also play a few card-games; Vampire - the Eternal Struggle, Rage, and Wizards of Middle-Earth. I also play Star Wars - the Role-playing game and the table-top game Warhammer 40000 and Warhammer Fantasy Battles.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have just finished the eleventh playable version of a roleplaying-game I have named "The Lost Roads of Lociam". It is a fantasy-game and I am playtesting it and looking for illustrators right now. I hope to publish it this spring.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I also participate in a few on-going live-roleplaying games of Vampire and am currently trying to set up one of my own as well. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I like writing, and I have several projects under way, at this time. A few years ago I mostly wrote poetry but now stories and articles are predominant.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I practice martial arts; Aikido, Tendo, and Tai Chi for the most part. I have been practicing martial arts for a long time, and have tried many different styles. It is a good way to keep fit, although I hate fighting. Hurting people and helping people doesn't match...</P>

<FONT COLOR=Navy> <P ALIGN="LEFT">Who I know:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I have utterly few friends, that aren't players of my games, one way or another.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=Navy> <P ALIGN="LEFT">Where I come from:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I come from a happy home in Västervik, some 400 kilometers from Borås, where I live. I have been privileged with a happy childhood with good parents, and nothing has been missing from my life (<I>almost. Nothing is complete...</I>).</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<FONT COLOR=Navy> <P ALIGN="LEFT">Where I am going:<FONT COLOR=BLACK> I plan to live and work in Canada, when I am done here. Done with what? Not sure, but I am sure I will know when I get there. I am going to move to Canada, though.</font></P><FONT COLOR=BLACK>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I got a C64 when I was in junior high, and after using it solely for gameplay I got an A500. This was really good, but after getting my first 52 Mb harddrive I was caught. Upgrading to an A600 with a 40Mb harddrive and filling it was a chore, but then I got this monster at 1.2 Gb, and I have never ever filled anything of that since.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Lacking in power put not prestige I had to retire it (it is now resting in a box in the basement along with with Vic 20 I picked up for about $4 at a yardsale) and got an A1200. Unfortunately I burned out the PAR-port on that one (my bad!) and bought another. This was back in 1997.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">After moving I came in contact with another Amigan; Stig, and with his help and guidance I upgraded to a towerbox, a 060-CPU and lots of other neat stuff, this after my external squirrel-SCI CD-player had a nice... well, let's say fire-related accident.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This machine is now used for everything; text- and picture-editing, surfing, email, word-processing and layout-work. It performs splendidly even in its currently crippled state (see below) and only at 50 MhZ it is still on par (work-wise) with any Wintel-computer I have ever worked with. I also make homepages with this machine, and still all by hand.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
