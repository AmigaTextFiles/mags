The County of Southampton and its privileges was not changed by Government reorganisation, and cannot be unless the Council allows the Charter to lapse by not keeping within its bounds. --or, of course, if we lose the Monarchy or the Council does something dreadful and is taken over by Central Government.<b><br>

        heritage of parks and , open spaces make it probaly the
        Greenest City in the UK. At the heart of the city are the
        historic Central Parks which recently celebrated their
        150th Anniversary and are lister on English Heritage's
        register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Linked to the
        Central Parks by the tree lined arterial road known as
        The Avenue is Southampton Common which has been referred
        to as the 'lungs of the city' since the19th Century. Much
        of the Common's 326 acres are designated a Site of
        Special Scientific Interest due in part to its thriving
        population of great crested newts and orchids. Located in
        this countryside setting is the award winning Hawthorns
        Urban Wildlife Centre where visitors can learn about the
        wildlife and ecology of Southampton's open spaces. You
        can also visit Southampton's new state-of-the-art free
        fun pool.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"> The Central Parks and Southampton Common are
        only a fraction of Southampton's open spaces which
        include formal parks, commons, recreation grounds, play
        areas. sports facilities, nature reserves and greenways.
        To find out more about the Green City's open spaces why
