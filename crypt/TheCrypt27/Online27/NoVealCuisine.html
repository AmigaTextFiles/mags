<CENTER>The ready meal, it's stated, provides a wholesome eat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>So while we were out shopping, we thought we'd have a treat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Well you can just imagine, our horror and despise,</CENTER>
<CENTER>When opened right before us was a meal of <B>meagre size.</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>We searched in deadly earnest to find elusive meat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There wasn't enough of it for a sparrow to eat,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And yet the pack was big enough to indicate a feast,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Of spuds and vegetables,  we had enough at least.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>Now who ever's responsible for what was passed as tea,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I'd dearly like to take out,  just for a day with me.</CENTER>
<CENTER>And show to him a truckers' cafe and the size of a meal, </CENTER>
<CENTER>Then ask of him <B>"Now truly,  how hungry do you feel ?"</B></CENTER>

<CENTER>Those people in Armani suits, they don't do work like this,</CENTER>
<CENTER>If you think that is a helping,  let me put it like this,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You're very, very wrong pal, so once I will exclaim,</CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Buying your frozen products - I never will again !</B></CENTER>
