<blockquote>
<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>It was Friday morning, and that meant it 
  was time for an activity that the teacher called ‘add to the picture’. The teacher 
  would call students to the chalkboard one at a time. The first student would 
  draw an object on the chalkboard, and each following student would add something 
  to the picture to make it a new picture.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:16.0pt;'>About this time, little Brian began waving his arm hysterically. 
  Little Brian was well known for being dirty-minded, so the teacher was reluctant 
  to call on him for anything. But as the teacher looked at the picture on the 
  chalkboard, she thought that there was no way that little Brian could possibly 
  do anything to make this picture dirty. So she called on little Brian, and he 
  ran to the chalkboard.</span></b></p>
