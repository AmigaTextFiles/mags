<P ALIGN="LEFT">A little old lady went into the Royal Bank of Canada one 
day. carrying a bag of money. She insisted that she must speak 
with the president of the bank to open a savings account 
because, <B>"It's a lot of money!" </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally 
ushered her into the president's office (the customer is 
always right!) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The bank president then asked her how much she would like to 
deposit. She replied, <B>"$165,000!"</B> and dumped the cash out of 
her bag onto his desk. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The president was of course curious as to how she came by 
all this cash, so he asked her, "<I>Ma'am, I'm surprised you're 
carrying so much cash around.</I> </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Where did you get this money?</I>" </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The old lady replied, <B>"I make bets."</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The president then asked, "<I>Bets? What kind of bets?</I>" </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The old woman said, <B>"Well, for example, I'll bet you 
$25,000 that your balls are square." </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Ha!</I>" laughed the president, "<I>That's a stupid bet. You can 
never win that kind of bet!</I>" The old lady challenged, <B>"So, 
would you like to take my bet?" </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Sure,</I>" said the president, <I>I'll bet $25,000 that my balls 
are not square!" </I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The little old lady then said, <B>"Okay, but since there is a 
lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow 
at 10:00 AM as a witness?" </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Sure!</I>" replied the confident president. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">That night, the president got very nervous about the bet and 
spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, 
turning from side to side, again and again. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was 
absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would 
win the bet. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old 
lady had appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">She introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: 
<B>"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!" </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady 
asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The 
president did. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then 
asked if she could feel them. <I>Well, Okay</I>," said the president, "<I>$25,000 is 
a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.</I>" </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging 
his head against the wall. The President asked the old lady, </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?</I>"</P> 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">She replied, <B>"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 
10:00 AM today, I'd have The Royal Bank of Canada's 
president's balls in my hand."</B></P>

during a holdup in Long Beach, California, would be robber 
James Elliot 
did something that can only inspire wonder: He peered down 
barrel 
and tried the trigger again. <B>This time it worked.</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat-cutting 
machine and, after a little hopping around, submitted a claim to his 
insurance company. The company, suspecting negligence, sent 
out one of 
its men to have a look. He tried the machine out and he also lost a 
finger. <B>The chef's claim was approved.</B> </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver 
found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting 
from Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his 
incompetence, let alone his intoxication, the driver went 
to a nearby 
bus stop and offered everyone waiting there a free ride. He then 
delivered the passengers to the mental hospital, telling the 
staff that 
the patients were very excitable and prone to bizarre fantasies. The 
deception wasn't discovered for 3 days.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An American teenager was in the hospital yesterday recovering from 
serious head wounds received from an oncoming train. When 
asked how he 
received the injuries, the lad told police that he was 
simply trying to 
see how close he could get his head to a moving train! before he was 
hit. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A mother took her daughter to the doctor and asked him to 
give her an 
examination to determine the cause of her daughters swollen 
abdomen. It 
only took the doctor about 2 seconds to say, <B>"Your daughter is 
pregnant." </B>The mother turned red with fury. She argued with 
the doctor 
that her daughter was a good girl and would never compromise her 
reputation by having sex with a boy. The doctor faced the window and 
silently watched the horizon. The mother became enraged and 
screamed, 
"<I>Quit looking out the window! Aren't you paying attention to me?</I>" </P>

time this happened, a star appeared in the East, and three wise men 
came. I was hoping to witness that when they show up again." </B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once upon a time,  a <B>perfect</B> man and a <B>perfect</B> woman met.  After a
<B>perfect</B> courtship, they had a <B>perfect</B> wedding. Their life together was, of
course,  <B>perfect</B>.  One snowy,  stormy Christmas Eve,  this <B>perfect</B>
couple were  driving their <B>perfect</B> car along a winding road,   when  they
noticed someone at the side of the road in distress.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Being the <B>perfect</B> couple, they stopped to help.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to
disappoint  any  children on the eve of  Christmas,   the  <B>perfect</B>
couple loaded  Santa  and his toys into their vehicle.   Soon  they  were
driving along delivering the toys.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately,   the  driving   conditions  deteriorated  and  the
perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Only one of them survived the accident.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Question: <I>Who was the survivor</I>?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Answer:</B> The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really
existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus
and there is no such thing as a perfect man.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the woman must have
been driving. This explains why there was a car accident.</I></P>

another point: Women never listen.</B></P>
