<P ALIGN="LEFT">November 19,  2002 - With the AmigaOne now shipping and AmigaOS4.0
in its final stages of development and testing,  the time has come
to  begin letting the rest of the world know the good news,   that
the Amiga is alive,  well and ready to let the World have fun with
computing again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  all  know  that the current hard core of Amiga  users  is  not
enough to build a sustainable and thriving community.  We have  to
appeal  to  those who,  for whatever reason left the Amiga  months
and  years  ago  but  who still retain a fondness  for  their  old
platform.   Whether  disillusioned with their  existing  offering,
looking  for a new way or simply wanting to return,  the marketing
for the reborn Amiga must concentrate itself on these people,  the
five  million or so who once owned an Amiga and who  could  do  so
once more.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  last  six months has seen us experimenting with  presence  at
various  multi-format shows and nurturing relationships  with  TV,
web and paper publications in order to test the waters and to  set
out  our  stall for the big push forwards.  Even in this  informal
process,  the response has been fantastic,  whether in the US, the
UK,   Europe or Australia.  People remember the Amiga and want  it
back.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  have  taken all this research and,  in conjunction with  Amiga
developers,  retailers,  user groups,  publications,   Amiga  Inc,
Eyetech  and  Hyperion have decided that we  will  concentrate  on
four official large scale multi-format shows around the globe,  in
order to maximize our presence,  message and exposure.  This  will
compromise a show roughly every quarter,  one for Europe,  one for
the  US  and  Canada,  one for the UK and one  for  the  Antipodes
(Australia, New Zealand and Asia).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  first  of  these  shows will be the official  launch  of  the
AmigaOne and AmigaOS4.0,  to occur at the CeBit show in Germany in
March  (and before anyone asks,  this does not mean  this  is  the
release  date  for AmigaOS4.0,  it means that CeBit  will  be  the
public launch of it).  With the huge exposure and attendance  that
CeBit brings in,  and being in Germany, one of the spiritual homes
of the Amiga, we think this an appropriate and exciting venue.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In  addition  we  will  support several other  important  national
shows  on  a cooperative basis with the dealers,  user groups  and
organizations in those countries.  Commitments have  already  been
given  to  attend  the SINTEP show in Toulouse,  France  in  April
2003, and at least one of the Micromart shows in Birmingham, UK.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  will  also support local dealers and organizers  of  the  main
Amiga  user group shows worldwide (subject to fitting in with  the
schedule of the larger shows above)  such as the Alt-WoA and  WoA-
SE shows in the UK,  as well as the main shows in France, Germany,
the  USA  and  Canada.  If you currently -  or  would  like  to  -
organize such a show during 2003 and would like Amiga Inc,  and/or
Hyperion  and/or Eyetech to attend please contact us  as  soon  as
early  as  possible during the planning stage.  Given the  limited
resources  we all have,  and the cost and complexity  of  planning
for  the quarterly shows,  we cannot guarantee attendance  but  we
will  do  our  best  to  support the community  wherever  it  gets
together to enjoy the Amiga platform.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So  much  for  2003 - what about the remainder of  2002,   and  in
particular  the  Aachen  show? We have all,   both  as  individual
companies and together,  thought long and hard about this show. It
has  been  decided that the timing could not  be  worse  from  our
respective points of view.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Eyetech  is  committed  to delivering the  Earlybird  systems  for
Christmas that week and Amiga Inc is fully occupied fulfilling  an
AmigaAnywhere contract,  and product launch.  Whilst visiting with
all of you is important,  we believe that it is more important  to
ship products right now,  and we simply can not work the show into
our schedules.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We  wanted  to  share this with you because many in the  community
have  asked the same questions that we have asked ourselves.   How
will  the  community grow and thrive? It can only  do  so  through
increased sales,  and that means increased awareness.  As we  move
from  survival  mode  to growth mode,  the  small,   local  shows,
however  much  fun  cannot  provide this  level  of  exposure  and
awareness.   By marching proudly and strongly into the  mainstream
shows,  and taking the community with us,  we are announcing  that
we are back, once and for all.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Have  no doubt that after 8 years of darkness,  2003 will  be  the
year  that  the  Amiga  once again makes the World  remember  that
there is a better way.</P>
