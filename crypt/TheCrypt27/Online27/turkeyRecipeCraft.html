<CENTER><B>This would make a cute hostess gift. It's also a fun and easy craft for kids 
to do.</B> </CENTER>

<B>Materials: </B><BR>
small brown paper bag <BR>
orange and yellow construction paper <BR>
6" piece of tan yarn index card <BR>
magazine page with dark brown colors on it <BR>
1 cup rice <BR>
brown acrylic paint <BR>
small piece of sponge <BR>
stapler or glue <BR>
black marker <BR>
hole punch <BR>
newspaper<BR> 
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the body, cut off the top half of the small brown paper bag and save for 
use later. Put the 1 cup rice in the bottom half then 
bring the top of the bag together and to a point then staple at that point. 
The bag should now be stapled closed so the rice will not come out. Put a 
small puddle of brown paint on a few layers of newspaper. Dip the small 
sponge into the puddle of paint then pat on the newspaper to take off excess 
paint. Now, dab the sponge all over the bag with the rice in it. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the wings, take the top half of the bag and cut it at each side so you 
end up with two pieces the same size. Dab these pieces with the sponge and 
brown paint on one side as you did for the bag with the rice in it. Let dry. 
Fold these two pieces accordion style then staple one end together so you 
have a small fan. Now staple or glue one fan to each side of the 'body'. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the legs, cut two 1/2" X 8" pieces of construction paper. For the feet, 
draw two 2" cup shapes with three 1/2" toes and cut them out. Staple one foot 
to one end of each leg, then glue top of the legs to the bottom of the 
`body'. For the tail, cut the brown colored magazine page to a 5" X 7" 
rectangle then fold into a fan and staple as you did for the wings. Glue or 
staple the tail to the back of the `body'.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the head, cut out a 4" light bulb shape from the orange construction 
paper. The head is the bigger part of the light bulb and the neck is the 
smaller part. Cut a 1" X 2" diamond from the yellow construction paper and 
fold in half the long way for the beak. Glue the back of one folded side to 
the head in the middle in beak position.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With the marker, draw on two eyes above and on the sides of the beak. You can 
also color in a red tongue with a red marker or crayon inside the beak if 
you'd like.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now your turkey should be finished all that's left to do is attach the 
recipe. On the index card, write the following recipe: </P>

<CENTER><B>Gobble-Good Turkey Casserole</B> </CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
1 can cream of mushroom soup <BR>
1 can cream of celery soup <BR>
1 package onion soup mix <BR>
1 cup rice <BR>
1 1/2 cups milk <BR>
2 or 3 cups leftover turkey <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Combine all ingredients in a large casserole dish. Bake covered 45 minutes at 
350*. Punch a hole in the left corner of the recipe with right side facing. 
Thread the tan yarn through the hole, then tie around the neck of the turkey 
and secure with a knot. This turkey looks really cute sitting on a shelf with 
legs dangling in the kitchen. </P>
