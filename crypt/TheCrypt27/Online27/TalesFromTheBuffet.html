<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well regular readers will know that my early days as a catering
Steward covered the Inverness-Wick, and Inverness-London routes.
However Ian was an ambitious sort of chap, and wanted the coveted
blue uniform of a "Chief Steward".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now in every Catering Depot, there is one line, that is hated by
the Stewards, This line is the normal starting point for people
climbing the ladder, Inverness depot was no different, The
Inverness-Aberdeen Route was detested by the Stewards and on a
regular basis ..they advertised for Chief Stewards.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So what was so wrong with this particular route ...The short
answer was - Everything.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The line between Inverness and Aberdeen was covered by the Dreaded
"DMU" ..For those not up to scratch with their railways, The DMU
was short for Diesel Multiple Units. A set of 3 coaches with a
drivers cab at both ends.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For the Railway operation ..The DMU was quite good, Having a cab
at both ends meant no need for Shunting or Turning the Train, Also
as several Units could be attached together, This meant that the
Set could easily be expanded or contracted to suit the Passenger
flow. Or in simple terms - 1 unit at Quiet times (3 coaches) and 3
units combined at peak travel (9 coaches) ...Great ...But not for
the Catering Staff.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The main problem was that each DMU had a small Buffet car in the
centre coach ..Great if only one unit was running, But when the
started adding/Subtracting units ...You had a living nightmare.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Add to this ...The DMU units were of considerable age and prone to
breaking down, Not a major headache for the Rail Staff as a unit
was easily replaced ...A major headache for the Catering Staff, as
at any given time the Unit you were on could suddenly be detached
and taken to the Sidings :(</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Another problem with this line was, You made 2 trips per day to
Aberdeen and back, Meaning you never retained the Same unit the
following day, So all your stock of food & drink had to be loaded
in the Morning and unloaded at night (Providing you got back).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On many occasions you arrived in the Morning, Only to find you had
been allocated a Unit that had been out of service for months,
Meaning the Buffet car was filthy, and had to be scrubbed down
before you could start serving food or drink. Having brought the
Vehicle up to scratch (hygiene fashion) you arrived in Aberdeen
only to find that the unit had developed a fault and was being
replaced :(</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">However despite all the Problems and pitfalls of the Inverness-
Aberdeen line ...I ended up as Chief Steward, and actually quite
enjoyed my time on this Route. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Several incidents stick in my mind ... One almost costing me my
Job.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After a short time working on any Railway Route, You become
acquainted with the Local Travellers. The Inverness-Aberdeen line
had more than its share of regulars ...Mostly Fishermen returning
home or Oilrig workers going or returning to their Two weeks on -
Two weeks off -Shift pattern.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One regular Customer "Jeff " was a cook on board of a Trawler
based at Aberdeen. "Jeff" was a nice chap, But had the Worst
Stutter I have ever heard.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ccccccccccccccccc .....Ccccccc ....Could I Hhhhhhhh...Hhhhh ...God
asking for a simple cup of Tea could take up to 5 Minutes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After several Months "Jeff" seemed to be more relaxed in my
company and his stutter became slightly less. Now I have no wish
to deride anyone with a speech problem, But "Jeff's" Stutter
always seemed to be worse when he was going to Aberdeen, Perhaps
the Stress of life on board a Fishing boat was the Cause, However
one day when he was returning home, And talking almost normally,
"Jeff" told me "When I start to Stutter ...Give me a Quick Slap on
the Cheek ....The Shock breaks my thoughts and my stammer will
stop.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I'll try anything once! ..So the next time I saw Jeff,
"Cccccccccccccccc ...SLAP! ...Can I have a cup of tea? It works :)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">After that "Jeff" and I got on like a house on fire.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It was several months after this, That the Problem arose. Although
Train Catering staff mostly work under their own Steam, The
Railways do appoint "Catering Managers" to ensure Quality & Hygiene
on board. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our Main Manager for Scotland was Mr Graham (Based in Glasgow) On
boarding a Train the Manager would check the Vehicle for
cleanliness check the Steward (Uniform etc.) Could your Stock,
Ensuring you were not selling Contraband goods etc..etc..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">One morning I was busily washing down the Shelves ..Prior to
departure when a voice said "Good Morning Mr Fyvie"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mr Graham ....Only the second time we had met, Obviously I was
slightly nervous when I discovered Mr Graham was travelling all
the Way to Aberdeen, However after the Initial Surprise and having
had a mild rebuke for a dirty shirt Cuff, Things seemed to settle
down. Mr Graham was standing enjoying a Cup of BR Coffee when the
Train arrived at Keith Station.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Jeff" boarded the Train ..And as normal headed straight to the
Buffet Car.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Cccccccccccccc-SLAP- Can I have a cup of tea ..Ian?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I Froze! ...Mr Graham was standing there ...Smoke coming out of
his ears ...His moustache and eyebrows bristled and his piercing
stare cut right through me.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">PANIC ....</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Jeff" ...This is my BOSS Mr Graham ...I said trying to recover
the Situation ...Tell him about the SLAP ..I said hopefully.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"Jeff" looked Mr Graham straight in the Eye and said "He's always
hitting me"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now working on Train Catering ...You can get away with a lot, But
Violence towards the Customer is a definite NO NO ..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Luckily after a frantic 10 minutes of explaining, and eventually
getting "Jeff" to understand the Seriousness of the Situation, Mr
Graham accepted that the "Slap" was gentle assistance and not My
Violent Nature.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In later Years ...Myself and Mr Graham would often share a joke
about this Incident ...But at that particular time, all I wanted
was a clean pair of underpants :)</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The second Incident was all down to these Dammed DMU's. I was awaiting departure from Aberdeen on my last trip, The busiest of the Week concidering it was a Friday. I already knew that I would be rushed off my feet, Having seen a lot of Rig Workers and Fishermen on the Station Concourse.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just befor i boarded the Train, I got a A Board and hastily scrawked on it in Chalk:-</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>BUFFET CAR AVAILABLE -CENTRE OF THE TRAIN</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I was inbehind the Counter prior to departure, Having a final stock up when I felt the Train start to pick up speed. Quickly I dropped the Serving hatch Shutters ..Expecting a vast crowd of Riggers and Fishermen demanding Drinks ...NOTHING!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In fact there was only around 10 people in the Whole three coaches I could serve. Quickly sticking my head out of the Window, Confirned my worst fears. The Railway had detached the Front Unit and added another at the Rear ...Meaning the Buffet Car was now on the Front Unit ...Of course everyone followed the Directions on the A Board.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"MORE PANIC"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">OK ...Ian had the solution ...I quickly got several Cardboard boxes ...Filled them with as much booze & Sandwiches that i Could, and when we stopped at the first Station (Inverurie). I detrained ..Quickly ran up the Platform and jumped aboard the Middle DMU.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunatly the Riggers & Fishermen ..Had asked the Guard, "Where is The Buffet" ...Front 3 coaches, So while I was climbing abouard the Middle three ...They ran past me and on to the Centre coaches.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Disaster.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Having so far taken in only a few Pounds on this Trip ..It was a rather despondant Ian that returned to his original DMU at the next Station.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course I had locked up the Buffet car before detraining, But on my arrival back ..The Shutters had been Burst open and a large portion of the Stock was missing :(</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This was terrible ...As I was responsible for any stock shortages ..I would have to pay for ALL the Missing Stock from my own pocket.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Rather disheatned I started to count up the Missing Items ...."Well over £40 worth"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly a guy appeared at the Counter ....I recognised his face, a rigger who travelled from Inverness.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">HERE!.... he said shoving a plactic cup full of notes into my hand ..The boys left this for you.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In that plastic cup was just over £60 ...At least £15 more than the Stock that was taken.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes! they might have been Rough and Ready Men ..But they were no Thieves ...Certainly the Salt of the Earth :)</P>
