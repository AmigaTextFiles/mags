<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Do you have the odd PC loving friend that insists in sending you email in HTML format ... Big files containing line upon line of html code ... with the occasional piece of recognisable text buried in there somewhere</I>?</P>

<I>I do ... OK you can choose to save the email</I> (to Ram) <I>rename it</I> (message.html) <I>then open your browser and then read the mail</I> (In all its glory) ..<I>But why should you</I>?

YamHTML <I>a cracking little program, Very easy to install</I> (Instructions included) ...<I>Now when you receive an html mail, Yam asks you if you want to View it as html ...Select Yes and it will open your Browser of Choice and display the mail in html format ...Brilliant</I> <B>:)</B>

<CENTER><B>Some info about my Arexx script:</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is used for reading HTML pages and embedded images (if there are) downloaded
along with e-mails using YAM mail client for Amiga. It uses various amiga browsers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>Note For All Users:</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I am very interested to have emails which gives you some problem (if they are not
private issues), I need them to test the script and, hopefully, find out the problem.
A brief description of the problem would be useful.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you send me the emails it's better to send them as attachments in raw format.
To get a raw format you may use save from the YAM message menu when you are on the
reading window.</P>

1.8a note:<BR>
Sometimes (rarely) it did not recognized HTML files if they were placed as
 the body of the mail.<BR>
It did not displayed images if there were one or more spaces on their names.<BR>
<BR>
1.8 note:<BR>
The icon driven batch file for the configuration now sets all the parameters.<BR>
 (It may be used instead of editing the first script lines 3 to 7 because it
  overrides this internal setting -see next Note-).<BR>
The option to choose between being asked or not when displaying an html page is now
 simplified by a sheer yes or not that also can be set by the batch file.<BR>
Adapted the documentation to this new version. I hope it's clear enough.<BR>
<BR>
1.7c-d Note: (Not public.)<BR>
Among other fixes, resolved a bug which blocked Yam if a bad configuration.<BR>
Added an icon to click to easily configure for the browser to be opened and the
 in new window option. It writes an local environment variable called yam0html which
 when exists the program overrides the configuration on its first lines and don't
 ask you for the browser of your choice.<BR>
<BR>
Remember that the prog always uses an already running browser regardless of
 the configuration. And if you like to use Voyager you must start it first manually,
 read on for more details. The "in new window" option is valid for Voyager too.<BR>
<BR>
1.7b Note:<BR>
Added a control on a never happened event ( but who knows ? ). and another minor but
useful change.<BR>
<BR>
For Boing Bag 3.9-2 users: It may happen that AWeb, if opened on its own screen,
remains stuck to the front and can only be dragged down.<BR>
It depends of the new exec.library, the cure is:
SetPatch SKIPROMUPDATES  exec.library
on the startup-sequence.<BR>

Installing has been updated to 1.8.<BR>

<CENTER><B>Installing: </B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">First of all you'll have to edit the first script lines 3 to 7 to set
your browsers paths and names and the other two options, modifying the preset
lines to your needs.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Don't use MultiView as Default it don't unlock files, use SimpleHtML instead.</P>

There are two ways for installing it:<BR>
1)<BR>
  » Copy the file YamHtml.yam into the Rexx directory inside YAM:.<BR>
  » Start YAM and press config button or select Configuration from the
    Settings menu.<BR>
  » Click on Arexx to the left list of options of the configuration window.<BR>
  » Scroll the Scripts list on the right until you see
    'When reading a message' option, then click on it.<BR>
  » Find the file using the Script gadget at the bottom,
    the string gadget must show: YAM:Rexx/YAMhtml.yam<BR>
  » Choose Arexx in the cycle gadget.<BR>
  » It seems to work fine regardless of the 'Wait for termination'
    checkbox  perhaps it is better to check it, just try it.<BR>
  » 'Open console window' checkbox may remain unchecked.<BR>
  » Click on Save.<BR>
  » Done<BR>
2)<BR>
  » Copy the file YamHtml.yam into the Rexx directory inside YAM:.<BR>
  » Start YAM and press Config button or select Configuration on the Settings menu.<BR>
  » Click on Arexx to the left list of options of the configuration window.<BR>
  » Look for the first free 'Scripts' menu entry (written in black are free)
    then click on it.<BR>
  » Find the file using the Script gadget at the bottom,
    the string gadget must show: YAM:Rexx/YAMhtml.yam .<BR>
  » Write YAMhtml in the 'Name' string gadget.<BR>
  » Choose Arexx in the cycle gadget.<BR>
  » It seems to work fine regardless of the 'Wait for termination'
    checkbox  perhaps it is better to check it, just try it.<BR>
  » 'Open console window' checkbox may remain unchecked.<BR>
  » Click on Save.<BR>
  » Done<BR>

Usage has been updated to 1.8.<BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><B>Usage:</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As there are two ways for installing it, there are two for using it too:</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Choosing the first installation method (preferred) the program automatically
checks if there is an HTML document to be seen and, accorcing to the setting,
asks you if you want or not see it as HTML or directly shows it up.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">With the second method the program remains inactive until you call it by the
Scripts menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Behavior has been updated to 1.7.</P>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><B>Behavior:</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If an Amiga browser is running (AWeb,IBrowse or Voyager) the program uses it,
otherwise it will ask you to choose one. (This only once in an Amiga session).
If an Amiga browser is not running and you have been asked once to open one,
the program reopen the browser you had first choosen.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But if you,in the meantime, have changed your mind, you may change your browser
by closing the one you are using and opening a different one by hand.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are on line with Genesis or Miami and one of the above browswrs is running
the script will let the browser to get the doc. related pictures from the net.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The script now put the browsers window (for AWeb the screen too) to the front
exept for IBrowse and Voyager: This two puts a new window to the front if the
variable NewWind in line 7 of the script is set to "YES".</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">1.7a Note: The NewWind="YES" variable now controls the opening of a new window
with AWeb also.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In this version, 1.7, I decided to cut off the option to start Voyager
from the prog. bacause it crashes my machine on starting Voyager,
precisely while loading cookies, I tried to take the piece of
code that does the job and run it as an Arexx macro from the shell
and it opens V nicely. It's unbelievable ,I can not understand.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, you may use V by starting it manually.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I think that V, at this stage, is a bit unreliable yet.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Please, read the beginning of this doc. on how to set the browsers paths and
names.</P>

<CENTER><B>Sideffect:</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Exiting Yam the script leaves a directory inside T: containing the last shown
document. It is not annoying to me but it is easy cure by writing a small ADOS
batch to be run on leaving Yam. If you want you may e-mail me about this and
for bug reports, thank you.</P>

1.7 Note:<BR>
I enclose now a little Arexx to put on "Program Termination" of the Yam arexx
configuration (if you wish) .It will delete the last shown doc and the dir in T: .<BR>
<BR>
Law:<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This script is freeware and I, the author, will NOT be responsible if this
script or its misuse may cause any damage whatsoever.</P>
