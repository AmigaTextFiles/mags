<P ALIGN="LEFT">This time out,  we bring you a special exclusive from the Severn Valley Railway, as 
Liz discovers the intricacies of a steam locomotive footplate through a Footplate 
Experience Course.  This has been brought about by Liz repeatedly stating a desire 
to "be on the footplate of one in steam" for the past six odd years.
These courses are highly popular, and very heavily booked. So much so that we 
were lucky to obtain a last minute cancellation,  by the skin of our teeth. Just right 
for a birthday present of a very unusual nature !</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's 5 AM,  birds are in the trees, coughing, and it's cold.  Two pairs of eyes 
apprehensively meet the harsh light of dawn from under the duvet, with the 
realisation that in three hours time they'll be perusing the wide open spaces of 
Bewdley railway station car park.  The arranged meeting place for the Footplate 
Experience Course.  Can Liz succeed? The only way to find out was to enrol her.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So, with the car packed and readied,  we set off in the direction of the Severn 
Valley Railway, to join the five others attending the course. The tutorials are held 
with groups of six,  and before mounting the footplate a brief instruction on health 
and safety rules is given.  The loco being used is one of the once numerous 
"Manor" class familiar to the Great Western Railway,  No. 7802, and the trainees 
are paired up to relieve conjestion on the footplate.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We arrive an hour earlier than required,  with the intent of a quick guided tour of 
the station complex before Liz starts her instructional.  7802 is already in steam, 
having been kept on a low fire overnight,  and the training crew are building the 
fire ready for the day's work.  A plume of grey smoke and the sound of a firing 
shovel break the silence of what promises to be a slightly overcast day,  as first one,  
then another loco, begin to be prepared for duty.  There's a fine mist of rain in the 
air,  but this abates before long,  and the canteen supervisor quietly appears, to 
open up and prepare for the others who will join us.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Though I've known Liz for many years, it's hard to judge quite what she's thinking -
she has one of those faces that betrays little,  but I know that excitement must be 
building now.  This is a culmination of a dream so old, it nearly belongs in a 
history book !</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The  <B>"on train"</B> staff have arrived now, and other trainees are also present,  the 
canteen is now serving toast and tea or coffee for the driving school as others 
arrive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Our train will consist of one coach, and work to Bridgenorth first,  then through to 
Kidderminster and return.  The  line is a good tutorial - plenty of gradients to 
provide an insight into the use of the injectors to maintain the water - level in the 
boiler,  single line token working,  and a fair few level crossings to contend with.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Tea and toast over,  the first thing is a group instruction on the subject of safety 
and an introduction to the crew and loco.  The trainees are led away to the loco by 
the footplate crew,  while spouses etc. remain in the canteen.  For those without 
overalls, there is a supply available,  and sticky paper labels for names to be 
attached for ease of identification.  Steam railways must be infectious;  for the topic 
of discussion is nothing but,  and pretty well informed,  too!  It rather left me 
wondering which ones were the real steam buffs,  with a well educated lady from 
the outer London area striking up a conversation with me, concerning steam 
working of the <B>West Coast Main Line</B> in it's heyday.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">On investigation,  a Stannier 5,  a pannier and a Duchess are found at the far end 
of platform 3.  The Duchess is a surprise to me;  technically, in my opinion, it's a 
little too heavy for this line,  and not expected to be here.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now it's time to board our train.  The Manor class is run around,  and coupled up 
by the crew,  and prepared for departure,  with the first trainees being selected.  
There seems to be an air of reluctance,  which soon dispels.  Liz is half of the 
second group,  who take over from the primary pair at Highley, and is firstly 
driver,  then fireman on the return.  I've done what I can to teach her without a 
loco,  but now it's for real,  and she does me proud.  A stiff regulator makes for an 
interesting pull away,  as she applies too little,  then a bit too much.  The result is 
wheelspin,  but it's beautifully controlled and corrected immediately,  despite wet 
rails.  The pep. talks have paid off,  and she's learnt to control the steam beast well 
by the time we make Bridgenorth having been given a further opportunity to 
accelerate from a near standstill. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It's here that our loco is detailed to take on coal,  and while this is happening,  it 
gives us the opportunity to look around the signal box.  This is a rare privilege, as 
very few people are allowed within the working area of the "box".  On shed are 
more unexpected locos;  a Battle of Britain class, and an A4,  Union of South 
Africa, to name but a few. The next turn of firing is Liz's, and she's now grinning 
like a Cheshire cat. A light round of coal in the box, and we're ready for the off. 
Unfortunately, she didn't stay on the footplate for a <B>"driving shot",</B>  but most 
certainly did drive.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At Highley, crews swapped again, and Liz re-joined us in the carriage for an 
unofficial de-brief of the experience. Back to Bewdley for a visit to firstly the signal 
box, then to the carriage and wagon dept. (a most interesting place for me, 
personally).  Then a brief lunch, de-brief, and a return to our train for a trip to 
Kidderminster station and signal box.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Regretfully, operating Gremlins showed on the approach to Kidderminster, and left 
the station out of our reach.  We had evidently missed our slot in the timetable. 
This meant a return to Bewdley without the opportunity to investigate the new 
carriage and wagon works or Kidderminster 'box. A great shame, perhaps we'll get 
another chance sometime. The new C&W shops are big enough to house 56 full 
length coaches,  and provide adequate protection from the elements.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This, we were told, is of prime concern to the railway.  As the greater part of the 
coaching stock is steel cladded wooden construction,  an extensive amount of 
damage can occur from water breaching the roof.  The protection that this structure 
provides is imperative to reduce maintenance costs, and improve the standard of 
rolling stock.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So back to Bewdley , then up to Bridgenorth and back again for tea and biscuits, 
taking time out for photo sessions and more video coverage. This completed the 
day for us, with certificates for those who took the course. In conclusion, it was a 
great day out; Liz has decided that she wouldn't mind the dirtiest job going, 
providing she eventually gets to drive again ( <I>something in the region of ten years 
of experience</I>) !  I hope that the course provides at least three more drivers / 
firemen in the near future.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>And for those that procrastinate - You'll never know until you try it!</CENTER>

<CENTER>That's all for now from me,  but Liz wants to take it from here, so, until next 
time..........A Merry Christmas everyone!!</CENTER>
