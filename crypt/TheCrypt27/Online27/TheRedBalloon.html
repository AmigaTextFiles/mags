<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just when you think you know it all, some 17-month old child comes along and
teaches you another valuable life lesson.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Little Lady lost her favorite ball.  There are few things that bring this
17-month-old more joy than playing with her favorite ball.  And, of course,
we want our daughter to have all the happiness she can get.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So we headed out to the store to replace the missing ball.  Little Lady
enjoyed the outing, since there were so many exciting things to pull off
shelves.  And when we reached the ball aisle, she nearly jumped for joy.
(<I>OK, more like raced to the bin and started covering the floor with her joy,
one bounce at a time</I>.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">As we left the aisle, Little Lady was happy and smiling.  She held her
replacement ball in her hands as we walked up to the cash.  While waiting to
pay, Little Lady caught sight of a red balloon that had obviously been used
for some promotion, but was now wandering aimlessly around the floor like a
lost puppy.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you think a ball can bring happiness, wait 'til you see the sparkle in
the eye of a toddler who has just found her very own red balloon.   Of
course, she adopted the balloon immediately and clung to it all the way back
to the car.  Did she want to hold the ball?  No way.  <B>She had a balloon!</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I couldn't help but marvel at how she valued the free, fragile balloon more
than the sturdy ball I had just paid money for.  Is there a lesson we can
learn for self-actualization?  Here are the possible lessons that
immediately occurred to me:</P>

<B>1</B>. Why bother having a thick skin, if your daughter prefers thin skins?<BR>
<B>2</B>. If you drift aimlessly long enough, you might get adopted.<BR>
<B>3</B>. Money can't buy the most important things in life (happiness, joy,
smiles, balloons, etc.)<BR>
<B>4</B>. Your child can see value where you cannot, so listen to what she says.<BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">I figure at least two of these are valuable lessons that can add happiness
to a person's life.  Little Lady teaches me self-actualization lessons daily
now, and I am learning to listen with head and heart.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">How often do we value the wrong things?  The things that cost the most?  How
hard to we work to earn all that extra income to buy things we simply do not
need.  Anyone reading this probably has more than she will ever need, and
yet don't we all want more anyway?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Suppose we chose to have less of the things money can buy, and instead chose
to have more time?  More time to spend with our family?  More time to spend
with ourselves?  More time to just be?  What if we are giving up the red
balloon chasing after the ball?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">My wife and I made a big decision a few months ago.  We gave up the condo in
the city for a big ol' house in the country.  Our red balloon was space to
raise a family in a much less noisy and stressed-out environment.  The ball
we gave up was the "<B>glamour</B>" of city living and a fancy condo.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Assuming we can make a living from my book, my ezine, my web site and
whatever other work-from-home projects I take on, we get to keep the red
balloon.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I invite you to look carefully at your life.  Ask what truly brings you
meaning.  Then ask yourself if you could have more of that if you spent less
time and effort on activities that don't bring you meaning but just fill
your time.</P>
