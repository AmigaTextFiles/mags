<P ALIGN="LEFT">The temperatures drop, the winds blow and the leaves begin to
fall. The November rain starts and soon we have no choice but to
bring out our coats, hats, scarves and gloves. We hope for at
least a few more sunny warmer days to get some outside things
done and enjoy the fall breezes.</P>

Thoughts of Thanksgiving and the holidays fill the air.<BR>
Decorations are in the stores.<BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Do the November rains remind you of a time to prepare?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">It does me, but I still remember to live in the moment as much as
I can and what is truly important in my life.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I rarely decorate for Halloween/Samhain anymore, I choose to
make it a harvest festival and decorate with pumpkins and corn
that can stay until after the turkey has been eaten.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I spend time gathering kindling wood for the stove, cutting back
bushes and clearing the garden. The herbs must be protected to
live through the winter for next years' sunny days. I don't
bother with the leaves for a while, since we live in the woods,
they will keep falling, just replacing the ones I already raked.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The November rain has always been a sign for me that winter is on
its way for sure. We shake the dust from our boots, stock up on
canned goods and the woodpiles grow higher and higher, but the
days grow shorter and shorter. The darkness falls on us before we
barely get in from a hard days work.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have already cleaned out the birdhouses and feeders, bringing
in the humming bird feeders so they don't freeze and burst,
cleaning them for spring, when the temperatures rise. The
chickadees and nuthatches are flitting about gathering for their
own families, feeling the chill in the air.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The cold November rain will come and the wind will blow. We've
already had the weatherman bring up snow flurries and gusting
winds that bring ice to our spot of the woods. The wood stove is
being used daily now, to keep the chill out of the air, with a
large kettle atop with water and a touch of cinnamon oil to float
the steaming aroma throughout the house.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This isn't even winter yet for us in eastern Virginia, that
begins in January and may last until April, with snow and ice and
the mud too.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">We always get a live tree for the holidays and plant it before
the winter grows bitter. We try to live in the moment as far as
not rushing here and there, being a bit old fashioned where we
can. So many want to get ahead and be prepared like we try to be
for winter. It's not unwise to be like that, but sad when we see
Halloween decorations and winter clothes in the stores before
summer is over.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the November rain always comes, whether we are ready or not.
But they bring a time for reflection and knowing "old man winter"
is near. Snowy days to do puzzles, read by the firelight,
bringing families closer together for a common goal. I wish that
all people everywhere could experience my November rain and what
it means to me.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have lived enough years to know the signs of winter. When the
November rain comes with each raindrop heavy on the leaves, more
will fall now that they have had their time for beautiful
displays for us all to enjoy. The beautiful red maples and the
golden yellow oak leaves are now brown and falling faster.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">I know when the November rain comes, its time for change. Time to
think of others too, as the holidays are approaching very fast.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When you see and feel the November rain or know Thanksgiving is
almost here, count your blessings and send some great positive
love and energy to all people all over the world so they can
enjoy the holidays too and remember that change and the time for
mother nature to rest, is a good time for reflection, meditation
and living life to the fullest from within.</P>
