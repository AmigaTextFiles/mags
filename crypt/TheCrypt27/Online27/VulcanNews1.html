<B>(1) How To Upgrade Your Portal</B><BR>
<BR><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- So much has changed in this version that you should only upgrade your Portal
when you know you will be on-line for a good 15 minutes. Obviously if you've got
broad band then oh aren't you lucky!. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For newcomers, first make sure you have disabled any download assistance
programs such as DAP or GetRight as they mess up the Portals Upgrading
function. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
        (a) Run your existing Vulcan Portal<BR>
        (b) Open the Upgrade Applications Panel <BR>
        (c) Click the Upgrade Vulcan Portal button<BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">..sit back, relax and let the Portal do it's thing. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(2) Community Decks </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version now deletes obsolete personas from the community decks, when
those decks are upgraded. This might not be noticeable to new comers to the
Portal as they already download 'up to date' personas from the community, but for
those of you who have been in the Portal for years, you should see allot of old
personas being removed when a deck is upgraded. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(3) Download All New Or Changed Skins </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Due to popular request, this version offers a new button from within the Deck
List Panel, previously (and still) you can download all 'new or changed' personas
for all decks, now you can also download any 'new or changed' Skins for all decks.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This function will be great for new arrivals to the Portal as it means they can get up
to date with the community very easily, and see how we all look. Although
downloading the current 200+ Skins may take a few minutes, I'm sure it will be
welcomed. For regulars to the Portal it simply means another option to get the
latest skins prior to reading the updated persona messages. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(4) Community Persona Information </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version offers an extra bit of information about personas that have been
uploaded to the community decks. When viewing a personas welcome message
you will now be able to tell the last version of the Portal they owned, prior to them
uploading their persona. This will really only kick in, if they have version 236 and
higher, and will simply say 0 if they have a version older than 236. For this reason
once you have this new Portal version you should upload your persona to the
Vulcan Orbiter straight away. </P>


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(5) New Persona Model With Long Hair</B> </P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version offers a new persona model to choose from, which has long hair,
well more like shoulder length hair. We did call it female-large as we also widened
this models face, but on testing we found it also works for males, so this can be
used generically. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(6) Revamped Default Persona Skins 2D And 3D</B> </P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- We have also revamped all of the persona default skins so they now work with
this new long haired model and also revamped all of the guides, newsreaders and
lizardian skins. Because of this we also changed the 2D skins for those of you
who don't have the correct hardware to enable Mother3D. </P>

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(7) Graphical Enhancements</B> </P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version has had allot of graphical enhancements here and there, the ones
being more noticeable than others will be in your Persona Settings Panel and the
Mail Tray Panels. They have also got some text based buttons to help new comers
find their way around the panels more easily. </P>


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(8) 3dVoiceChat</B> </P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version has had allot of work done on 3dVoiceChat, firstly we have now fixed
the bug that garbled persona names in the 'what is being said' panel and now your
guide announces 'arrivals and departures' to your chat session. This is handy if
you are looking away, as you can now hear who has arrived in your cell and also
know their names before they start to speak. </P>


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(9) 3dVoiceChat Wallpaper </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version has implemented a new feature especially for Princess Soosan on
deck 24. It is a selection of wallpaper that you can choose for your cell when
launching a chat session, giving you that personal touch. At present the wallpaper
selection is pretty rubbish, but these will change over the coming days and we will
try to add more.</P> 


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(10) 3dVoiceChat Language & Passwords </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version now displays the language of the personas cell who opened it for a
chat session. This is handy as we recently had a spanish speaking persona enter
an english speaking cell and it was utter chaos. Also you may see in the list of
personas with cell doors open, a space for a padlock symbol. This is the start of
the password system that will be implemented in full in the next Portal version.</P> 


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(11) 3dVoiceChat Lighting The Speaker</B> </P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- This version has a test new feature, we are not 100% sure about it yet, but it
changes the lighting of the persona who is currently speaking. We would love
some feedback on this, as we are still not sure if this is a good thing or not. </P>


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(12) New SkinBadge </B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- And finally this version offers the image for the Eternal Knights SkinBadge </P>


<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>(13) Need Assistance?</B></P>
<FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">- As usual, any problems, simply reply to this email, and you'll get a personal
response.</P>
