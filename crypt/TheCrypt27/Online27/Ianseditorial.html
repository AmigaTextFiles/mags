<P ALIGN="LEFT">Candles  And  Crackers <FONT COLOR=WHITE> :-<FONT COLOR=SILVER>  The   basic  ingredient  for  a  <B>Merry
Christmas</B>,  And that is just exactly what we have brought  you  in
this Issue.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=WHITE><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Forget  the feasting,  Over Indulging and the opening of presents,
The <FONT COLOR=RED> <B>CRYPT  27</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER> has arrived ..All the Christmas goodies  you  could
hope for<FONT COLOR=WHITE> <B>:)</B></font></font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=WHITE>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT">So here we are ..  Fast approaching the end of 2002 and gearing up
for the festive season and to welcome in <B>"The New Year"</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Amidst all the hectic turmoil that surrounds this period,  Perhaps
it  is  a good time to take a short break and look at events  over
the past 12 months.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"The  AMIGA is Back" :</B>- Yup!  for the first time in God known  how
many years ...A New AMIGA Machine is shipping.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Sadness and Joy :</B>- Joy that it has happened, Sadness that 
    it didn't happen some 5 years ago. Am I excited about the NEW AmigaOne? ...No 
    not really, The fact it is shipping minus the OS ...The fact that there has 
    been little or no announcements regarding New software ..Well it kind of dulls 
    the emotions.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Will I buy an AmigaOne? ...  I don't rule out the possibility, But
first I want a fully working set-up ...Not just a Motherboard.   I
want reviews and notice of NEW software that will make use of  the
AmigaOne ... When this happens i will be a little more prepared to
part with my cash.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2002</B>  was a strange sort of topsie turvey year for the<FONT COLOR=RED> <B>CRYPT</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER>,   We
were  all  shocked at Ray Hawkins announcement that  for  personal
reasons  he was leaving the Magazine.  Ray has been a good  friend
both  to  myself and all other team members,  He  is  still  sadly
missed.</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">However on the other hand the <FONT COLOR=RED><B>CRYPT</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER> 
    has gone from strength to strength ... The viewing figures are climbing each 
    issue, and I would hope that you all agree that the publication is becoming 
    a lot more professional.</font></font></P>
  <FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Enough of looking backwards (<I>You can't change history</I>)  2003  will
be  an exciting year for the <FONT COLOR=RED><B>CRYPT.</B><FONT COLOR=SILVER>  Already discussions have been
held  and agreements made of certain changes,  Which we hope  will
mean even more readers for our site.  Already more companies  have
agreed to advertise their wares in our pages (<I>see the next issue</I>).
Well  that's  about it for this year,  on behalf of  all  the  team
members may I offer you the Readers :-</font></font></P><FONT COLOR=RED><FONT COLOR=SILVER>
