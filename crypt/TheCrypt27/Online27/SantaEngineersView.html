<FONT COLOR=WHITE><CENTER>Some stats for all you Santa believers!</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B> I.</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) 
in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of all 
religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of 
the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference 
Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, 
that comes to 108  million homes, presuming that there is at least 
one good child in each.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B>II.</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to 
the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he
travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7
visits per second.  This is to say that for each Christian household with a
good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, 
hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the 
remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left 
for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get on to 
the next house.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"> Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed        
 round the earth (which, of course, we know to be 
false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are 
now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 
million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means 
Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second --- 3,000 times the 
speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made 
vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per 
second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per 
hour.</P>


<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B>III.</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. 
Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego 
set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not 
counting Santa himself.  On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no 
more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the "flying" reindeer could 
pull ten times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or 
even nine of them. Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases 
he payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 
tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the 
ship, not the monarch).</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"> <B>IV.</B><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second crates enormous 
air resistance --- this would heat up the reindeer in the same 
fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead 
pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per 
second each.  In short, they would burst into flames almost 
instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating 
deafening sonic booms in their wake.  The entire reindeer team would 
be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the 
time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip.  Not that it matters, 
however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 
650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to centrifugal forces 
of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would 
be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, 
instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a 
quivering blob of pink goo.</font></P><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

 <FONT COLOR=SILVER><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>V.</B> <FONT COLOR=AQUA> Therefore, if Santa ever did exist, he's dead now. </font></P></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA><FONT COLOR=SILVER><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
