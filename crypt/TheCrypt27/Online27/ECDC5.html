<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span style='color:red'>What!!!!.Another 

  CD Copier</span></u></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    Well, not really, just one I think that hasn`t been reviewed, 

  or it may have done in the past when I was on the A1200, so if it has I`m sorry, 

  however if it hasn`t then although this is not such an in-depth review with 

  screenshots like Ian Urie did a short while ago about Nero, but I`ll try my 

  best.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    A few months ago, soon after I got my <span class=GramE>PC(</span>b4 

  I upgraded it) I popped around to another PC m8 of mines house, he lives about 

  a 5 minute bike ride from me, and he`s pretty s*&amp;t-hot when it comes to 

  all software and hardware  for the PC, he used to build them as both a hobby 

  and a living,HE IS GOOD.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    Anyway, he was backing up some of his PC CD`s, and I 

  saw this program called Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum that he was using, and compared 

  to Nero ECDC 5 looked so simple to use, and although it seemed simple to use, 

  the actual layout didn`t look tacky cheap or nasty, it looked good. Now, although 

  I hadn`t bought my own CDRW yet, I was pretty impressed with just how fast the 

  copying process was going, especially to my old Mitsumi CDR that I use to use 

  on my trusty A1200.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    At that time I had decided to fully upgrade my PC setup 

  to a pretty high-spec one and was definitely going to get a CDRW, and was considering 

  either an LG or Liteon, anyway, Neil, my mate, has his own original version 

  of ECDC 5, but when he bought his brothers PC from him plus tons of software 

  there was also a full original version of ECDC 5 that his brother had bought 

  some time ago, so cutting a long story short, Neil sold me this other ECDC5 

  CD which used to be his brothers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    Shortly after that I managed to scrounge, beg &amp; borrow 

  enough money together in order to buy myself a CDRW. Unfortunately being inpatient 

  I didn`t want to bother to go to either one of two PC counters in Ruby of which, 

  both were a good half an hours journey, from me. No, I wanted a CDRW Yesterday 

  as they say, so I had to settle <span class=GramE>for</span> an LG, which isn`t 

  such a bad writer-rewriter.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    By the time of installing this item I had upgraded my 

  system myself, and for a little while was in two minds of what version of Windows 

  to go for. B4 my upgrade I tried Windows 98 ME, which was put on my PC when 

  I first bought it from another mate of mine in Rugby, but I soon found out that 

  ME was shite, so I went over to 98SE, which I found out was better and far more 

  error-free, then I tried Windows XP Pro, and fell in love with its looks, ok, 

  so some or most PC users think that XP is crap, I don`t, but then again I`m 

  a sad old git, Steve E would agree there.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    So XP Pro is where I stayed, then my big hardware upgrade 

  came, and I installed XP, and have stayed with this till now, and I won`t change. 

  Then the only problem with XP as opposed to other versions of Windows, you need 

  to update/upgrade lots of drivers for software/hardware, far more often than 

  you have to do with other Windows version. I had problems with ECDC5 recognizing 

  my LG CDRW, but after an 18Mb or so download from the Roxio (the creators of 

  ECDC5 I think) website, my problems stopped, then only last night, my mate Neil 

  told me that there was yet another 18Mb or so new update to ECDC5 with loads 

  of drivers etc, I was going to go home from work and d.load the file, but he 

  had already done it for me in about 4 mins bcos he`s on b.band.mega fast.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    So, at present, ECDC5, my LG CDRW and my whole system 

  is running pretty sweet, but it could change so quickly, because that`s how 

  the PC is, anyway, enough of this dribble, on with the task in hand..</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum in my opinion is, or could 

  be a serious contender to join the exclusive ranks of the top CDRW software, 

  such as Nero &amp; CD Clone, like the previous two programs I`ve just mentioned 

  ECDC 5 is pretty damn easy to use, in fact, I found Nero a tad harder to understand, 

  of course, there`s a few software items that both Nero &amp; ECDC 5 won`t copy, 

  that`s where CD Clone comes in useful, so for me, I`d prefer to have both ECDC 

  5 and CD Clone installed on my hard drive, but being the greedy sod that I am 

  I`ve got all three, it`s best to be safe than sorry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    I dare say that I could write a few more pages about 

  the features that ECDC5 has got, but although only used Nero once I dare say 

  that is has some. Or most of the same or similar features that ECDC5 has got, 

  all I will say that having used Nero a few times I didn`t like it much, admittedly 

  it`s a bloody good program, but personally I found ECDC5 far better to use, 

  and easier, also I think that it`s got a few more features, but like all software 

  it`s a case of Each to his/her own isn`t it.Hope u enjoy reading this article.</p><br><br><center><font color=green>Dr
