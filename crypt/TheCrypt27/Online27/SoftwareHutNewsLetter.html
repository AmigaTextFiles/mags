<P ALIGN="LEFT">Yes it has been a long wait but the Amiga One units look like they are 
going to start shipping in mid to late December. We wanted to let everyone 
know the latest pricing for the boards and for completely configured units. 
Please note that Eyetech has announced that the first shipments of the 
Amiga One will come with ONLY LinuxPPC and UAE and that the OS 4 we have 
all been waiting for will be ready early next year. The advantage is all 
who preorder a system will receive a free OS 4 when released (about a $ 
100.00 retail value). Following are the prices and configurations that will 
be available. We encourage anyone interested to preorder as soon as 
possible to make sure we are able to fulfill all the orders we receive when 
the first units ship later next month. If you preorder by credit card you 
are not charged until the units ship.</P>
