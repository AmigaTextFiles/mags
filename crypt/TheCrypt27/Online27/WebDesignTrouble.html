<P ALIGN="LEFT">Getting your web site to look right can sometimes be a
hair-pulling experience.  Even for professional web designers! I
can only imagine how frustrated many newbies can get.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Let me share with you some of the common problems in designing a
well-functioning web site.  If you haven't made these mistakes

<CENTER><B><U>1. PROBLEM:  MISSING IMAGES ON THE PAGE </U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  there are three things that might cause this problem.
You have either forgotten to upload the image to your web server,
didn't link to it correctly, or the graphic is in invalid format.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1)</B> Remember, you need to upload all the graphics that you are
using on your web page, just like any other file.  So if you have
a "services.html" page that contains "staff.jpg" graphic, you
need to upload both "services.html" and "staff.jpg" to your web
server.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2)</B> You also need to reference that image correctly. For this, you
need to understand a little bit about files, folders, and
directories.  Basically, a file is a document. A folder (or a
directory) is a collection of files.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You might have a directory on your web site called "images". 
Inside it you might have the "staff.jpg", "logo.jpg", and other
files.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now, here is the trick:  if your HTML file is located in the same
folder with the graphic it contains, then here is how you refer
to that image:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="graphic.jpg"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>*Please, note that I am leaving the tag brackets out so you could
see the HTML code.</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So far, simple, right?</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">But let's say that your HTML file is located in the main
directory, while the graphic file is located in the
sub-directory.  For example, "services.html" is located in the
root directory of your web site so that if you type
www.yoursite.com/services.html in your browser location bar, you
will see it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">And let's say that you placed a graphic used on that page into a
sub-directory called "images", so that when you type
www.yoursite.com/images/graphic.jpg into your browser location
bar, you will see that image.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">So how do you refer to that graphic from your "services.html"
page?  Here is how:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="images/graphic.jpg"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">All I did was put the sub-directory (<I>or folder</I>) name followed by
a forward slash before the graphic name.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, what if you put an HTML page into a sub-directory, but
leave the image in the main (<I>root</I>) directory?  For example, your
<B>"services.html"</B> is located in a sub-directory called <B>"pages"</B>. 
And the graphic used on it, <B>"staff.jpg"</B>, is placed in the main
directory, so that when you type this address into your browser
location bar, you will see it:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>www.yoursite.com/staff.jpg</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">How do you refer to this graphic on your "<B>services.html"</B> page?
You use  the "previous directory" notation like this:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="../staff.jpg"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The browser will then know, that in order to find that graphic it
needs to look in one directory below.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you are having trouble understanding the above notation, use
absolute image references.  For example:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="http://www.yoursite.com/staff.jpg"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Make sure you know where you placed your graphic (<I>which folder</I>)
and refer to it as if you were accessing it from your web
browser.  That's it!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">3) And finally, if you are not using graphics with the "JPG" or
"GIF" extension, they will not appear on your web page.  Use 
PaintShop Pro or any other graphic editor download.com) to
convert your graphic from any format to "JPG" or "GIF".</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Broken images may also happen even if they have the right
extension.  That's because they have been created in a
not-for-web format.  When a graphic artist designs your logo,
remind her to save it as <B>"RGB"</B> (<I>which stands for
"red-green-blue</I>") or <B>"Indexed Color"</B> and not any other color mode
(<I>such as "CMYK"</I>).</P>

images" at <A HREF="http://tech.irt.org/articles/js206/index.htm">http://tech.irt.org/articles/js206/index.htm</A></P>

<CENTER><B><U>2. PROBLEM:  IMAGE LOADS VERY SLOWLY</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B> you must do your best to reduce the graphic to its
minimum good-looking format. Use GIFBot to do this:
<A HREF="http://www.netmechanic.com/GIFBot/optimize-graphic.htm">http://www.netmechanic.com/GIFBot/optimize-graphic.htm</A></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some new webmasters use a large graphic and specify a smaller
size in the HTML code. That is absolutely unnecessary and will
slow down your web page three times or more!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For example, if you have a graphic that is 200x200 in size
(<I>pixels</I>), and insert it into your web page like this:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="graphic.jpg" width=100 height=100</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">...you are actually doing yourself disservice. Why not reduce the
graphic in your image editor first, then place it on your web
site? Doing this will speed up your site and will not distort
your graphic.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>3. PROBLEM:  IMAGE LOOKS DISTORTED</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B> you probably specified incorrect size of this graphic
on your web page.  To find out the correct size of a graphic,
right-click on it and choose "Properties" from the menu.  You
should see the image size (<I>something like 110 x 200</I>) then put the
same numbers in the IMG tag:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>img src="graphic.jpg" width=110 height=200</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you want to change the size of the image, do so in a graphic
editor instead of right on your web page, to avoid distortion or
a pixelated look.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>4. PROBLEM: BROKEN LINK</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  you must fix your link so it takes your visitors to a
page that exists.  Links can be relative or absolute.  Here is an
example of a relative link (<I>remember, I am omitting the tag
brackets so you could see the actual code</I>):</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>a href="welcome.html"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">This link refers to a page that is located on <B>YOUR</B> web site, and
not someone else's.  Now, here is an example of an absolute link:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>a href="http://www.yoursite.com/welcome.html"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice that this link will take you to the exact same page that
the first one will.  This is just a different way to build your
links.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You can also link to someone else's web site using absolute
links:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>a href="http://www.yourfriendsite.com/hello.html"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Can you use relative links to refer to an outside web site?  No. 
Only absolute links can do that. And remember to use the
"http://" in each absolute link tag.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>5. PROBLEM:  TEXT IS MISSING ON THE PAGE</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  this can happen for different reasons, but all of them
have to do with closing tags:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1)</B> When a closing table tag is missing, the entire table content
might be missing, too.  So remember to close all your TABLE, TR
and TD tags.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2) </B>You forgot to close a comment and the browser "thinks" that
the rest of the text has also been commented out.  Make sure you
close every comment that you open.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>3)</B> You forgot to close a quotation mark in a tag.  For example,
if you use quotes in a IMG SRC or A HREF tags, you must close
them:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>IMG SRC="picture.jpg" width=100 height=300</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The above code will cause the page to display incorrectly. Fix it
by adding a closing quotation after the graphic name.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>4) </B>If you using TEXTAREA in forms, make sure you close it with a
/TEXTAREA tag.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>6. PROBLEM: VISITORS CAN'T SEE YOUR FANCY FONTS</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION: </B> do not use your fancy fonts.  There are only a handful
of fonts that every computer user has installed.  They are: 
Verdana, Arial, Courier, & Times New Roman.  If you try to use
some other font such as Impact or FreeStyle Script, and your
visitors don't have them installed, they will see your text in
whatever font their browser is set to.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you <B>REALLY</B> want your visitors to see your handsome fonts, then
turn some of your text into graphics.  Your graphics will be
displayed the same on every computer, and your visitors will be
able to see the fonts you meant for them to see.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>7. PROBLEM:  TOO MUCH HORIZONTAL SCROLLING REQUIRED</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  put your text into a table and make it no more than
85% in width and centered.  This way, regardless of how large or
small their monitors are, your visitors will always see your text
centered with no horizontal scrolling necessary.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also check for links that may be too long, or images that are too
wide.  Both will make a web page wider than the screen may allow
to view.</P>

<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><B><U>8. PROBLEM:  THE TABLE IS WIDER THAN SPECIFIED</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  sometimes even you specify table width as 500 pixels,
it might still stretch to all 700. There are two reasons for
that.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>1)</B> You have a graphic in that table that is wider than the table
itself.  Reduce its size and the table will shrink as well.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>2)</B> You are using a long URL somewhere in the table text.  Shorten
it or remove it and you will see the table shrink to its
specified size.</P>

<BR>

<CENTER><B><U>9. PROBLEM:  WEB PAGE DISPLAYS OLD LINKS AND IMAGES</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  refresh (<I>or reload</I>) the page by clicking the button on
the toolbar of your browser.  Sometimes the graphics are still
not being refreshed in which case you need to do this:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- right-click on the graphic  - choose "view image" or "open
image"  - click "Refresh" when the graphic is displayed by itself</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Now come back to your web page and press "refresh" button one
more time.  You should now see the updated images.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Also, if you are using an FTP program to upload your files,
remember to click "Refresh" in the FTP window before uploading
new files.  Otherwise, you will simply upload the old versions.</P>

<CENTER><B><U>10. PROBLEM:  BACKGROUND DOESN'T SHOW</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  make sure to upload your background image along with
the other files.  Also, make sure you upload it into the right
directory (<I>see "missing image on the page" above for more
information)</I></P>

<HR WIDTH=50% COLOR=BLUE>
<BR>
<BR>

<CENTER><B><U>11. PROBLEM:  CAN'T ACCESS YOUR HOME PAGE</U></B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>SOLUTION:</B>  if you get an <B>"access denied"</B> error or a list of files
when you are trying to access your web site, make sure you named
your home page correctly.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Every hosting company has it set up so that the very first page
of your site must be named <B>"index.html"</B>.  Sometimes, though, they
will require your first file to be called <B>"welcome.html"</B>,
<B>"default.html"</B>, "home.html", or <B>"default.htm"</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is only one way to find out:  ask them! Or visit their web
site to see if they specify the default file name in their tech
support section.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Notice that <B>"default.html"</B> and <B>"default.htm"</B> are two different
files.  You can name your files either way, but only one of them
will be accepted as a default one.</P>
