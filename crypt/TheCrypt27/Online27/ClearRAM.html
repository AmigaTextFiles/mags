<P ALIGN="LEFT">If you use your Amiga for internet work (<I>Email-Browsing etc.</I>) then the chances are ..That like me, You continually make use of the <B>RAM</B> Disk. The Amiga <B>RAM</B> disk is excellent for saving Emails-Attachments ...Downloading Files ...Music/Pictures etc.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In fact <B>RAM</B> is vital in my everyday internet operation ...<B>BUT</B> a slight problem ...The <B>RAM</B> disk can very quickly get cluttered (<I>Try downloading a few files from the Aminet ...then Unarchiving them to see exactly what I'm talking about</I>).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>OK</B> ...If you use Opus as a workbench Replacement, The problem is easily fixed ...Click on the unwanted files and select delete. However if you do not Use Opus as a Replacement ...We have the Answer ....<B>ClearRAM.</B></P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=NAVY>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  know  the problem :  Your RAM:  disk is full of files and thousands of
subdirectories,  and  you  want to delete them.  But how ?  Issuing 'Delete
RAM:#?   All'  won't help, because that will corrupt your clipboard and the
temporary  preferences  in  ENV:.   So  what  do  you  do ?  You start your
directory-tool  and  click  all  files  and directories manually, and press
'delete'  ?   Sound  too  complicated ?  Too familiar ?  Well, here is your
solution  :   ClearRAM,  it  will  wipe all files and directories from RAM:
(<I>regardless  of  their  protection  state</I>),  but  leave  disk.info, ENV, T,
Clipboards intact.</P>

<CENTER> <U><B>Installation</B> </U></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This  is  very  simple.   Just copy the program into your C:  directory (<I>or
anywhere  else</I>).   It  doesn't  require any additional libraries (it should
work fine with 1.3 anyway!)</P>

 <CENTER><U><B>Usage</B></U> </CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Usage of the the program is quite easy : If you launch the program from the
Shell, you may issue several options on the commandline. The template is :</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><B>ClearRAM VERBOSE/S QUIET/S CAREPROTECT/S</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>VERBOSE:</B> If you specify this option, the progress of deletion will
  be displayed, i.e. every file/directory name will be
  displayed.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>QUIET:</B> This option can be used to tell the program to produce no
  output, even if an error occurs.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>CAREPROTECT:</B> Normally an unset 'D' flag, protecting a file from 
                  deletion would be ignored by ClearRAM. If you specify 
                  this option, ClearRAM will take care of this flag, and
  leave files with an unset 'D' flag intact (<I>but will give
  a warning </I>[not in quiet mode]).</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>ClearRAM</B>  can also be started from Workbench (<I>well, if you draw an Icon for
it</I> :), but it won't recognise any options, even if defined as a ToolType.</P>

<CENTER> <U><B>Bugs</B></U> </CENTER>
<BR>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Well,  there  is  no  known  bug,  except  the  fact that there is no stack
checking  performed.   So  if you have 10 subdirectories or more you better
increase the stack a little bit!  Unfortunatly, I haven't got an ability to
check  this  out  with  a stack monitor, but examination of the source code
estimates a rouch approximation of required stack by 420 bytes/directory.</P>
