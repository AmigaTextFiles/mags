<CENTER><B>'Twas the night before Jesus came and all through the house</B></CENTER>
 <CENTER><B>Not  a creature was praying, not one in the house</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Their Bibles were lain on  a shelf without care</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>In hopes that Jesus would not come there.</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>The  children  were  dressing to crawl into bed,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Not  once  ever kneeling or bowing a head.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>And Mom in her rocker with baby on lap</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Was  watching the late show while I took a nap.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>When out  of  the East there arose such a clatter, </B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I sprang to my feet to see  what was  the matter.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>Away to the window I flew like a flash</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Tore open the  shutters and threw up the sash!!</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>When what to my  wondering eyes  should  appear</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>But angels proclaiming that Jesus  was  here.</B></CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>With a light like the sun sending forth a bright ray</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I knew  in  a moment this must be The Day!</B></CENTER>
<BR> 
<CENTER><B>The light of His face made me  cover my  head </B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>It  was Jesus!  returning like He said.</B> </CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>And  though  I possessed worldly wisdom and wealth,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I cried when I  saw  Him  in spite  of myself.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>In the Book of Life which He held in  His  hand</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Was  written the name of every woman and man.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>He spoke not a word as  He  searched for my name,</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>When He said,  "It's not here."  My head  hung in shame. </B></CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>The people whose names who had been  written with love</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>He gathered to take to His Father above.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>With those who were  ready  He  rose without a sound</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>While  the  rest  were  left standing around.</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>I fell to my knees,  but it was too late;</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>I had waited  too long and thus sealed my fate.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER><B>I stood and I cried  as they rose out of sight;</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Oh, if only we had been ready tonight.</B></CENTER>
