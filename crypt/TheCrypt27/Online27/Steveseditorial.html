  <p><FONT COLOR=AQUA>As you know from my last Editorial, we were in the middle 
    of moving The <font color=red>Crypt</font> to it`s very own server so everything 
    would be in the same place and we wouldn`t have to rely on the generousity 
    of others for much wanted web space. Well, things went very smoothly with 
    just a slight hiccup that I hope you didn`t notice. And in the end I`m sure 
    you will agree that it`s all been worthwhile as it makes things a lot easier 
    for me linking all the issues together and not having to remember who was 
    hosting Issue so and so this time :)</font></p>
  <p><FONT COLOR=AQUA>So as the year draws to a close, what do we make of 2002? 
    Was it a good year for you? </font></p>
  <p><FONT COLOR=AQUA>Personally it was a very good year for me, celebrating our 
    20th wedding anniversary. Both the boys have left school now and have settled 
    down into their jobs, and hopefully things will get even better for the coming 
    year. So here`s to happy Cryptmas and a prosperous New year, and thanks for 
    making the magazine your regular read.<br>

    <FONT COLOR=AQUA>If an article catches your eye, or there`s something that 
    you disagree with in the </font><font color=red>Crypt</font><FONT COLOR=AQUA> 
    then write to us and let us know, we like to hear from you and will reply 
    to all of them. </font></p>
