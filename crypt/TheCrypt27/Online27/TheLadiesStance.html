 <CENTER>My mother was a fanatic about public toilets. As a</CENTER>
<CENTER>little girl, she'd bring me in the stall, teach me to wad</CENTER>
<CENTER>up toilet paper and wipe the seat. Then, she'd carefully</CENTER>
<CENTER>lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat. Finally,</CENTER>
<CENTER>she'd instruct, "Never, never sit on a public toilet</CENTER>
<CENTER>seat." And she'd demonstrate...</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER><B>The Stance</B></CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position</CENTER>
<CENTER>without actually letting any of your flesh make contact with the toilet</CENTER>
<CENTER>seat. But by this time, I'd have peed down my leg. And we'd go home.</CENTER>
<BR>

<BR>

 <CENTER>That was a long time ago. I've had lots of experience with public</CENTER>
<CENTER>toilets since then, but I'm still not particularly fond of of them,</CENTER>
<CENTER>especially those with powerful, red-eye sensors. Those toilets know</CENTER>
<CENTER>when you want them to flush. They're psychic. But I always confuse</CENTER>
<CENTER>their psychic ability by following my mother's advice and assuming...</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER><B>The Stance.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

 <CENTER>The Stance is excruciatingly difficult to maintain when one's bladder</CENTER>
<CENTER>is especially full. This is most likely to occur after watching a</CENTER>
<CENTER>full-length feature film. During the movie pee, it is nearly impossible</CENTER>
<CENTER>to hold The Stance. You know what I mean. You drink a two liter cup</CENTER>
<CENTER>of Diet Coke, then sit still through a three-hour saga because even if</CENTER>
<CENTER>you didn't wipe or wash your hands in the bathroom, you'd still miss</CENTER>
<CENTER>the pivotal part of the movie or the second scene, in which they flash</CENTER>
<CENTER>the leading man's naked derriere. So, you cross your legs and you hold</CENTER>
<CENTER>it. And you hold it until that first credit rolls and you sprint to the</CENTER>
<CENTER>bathroom, like wonderwoman, about ready to explode</CENTER>
<CENTER>all over your internal organs.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="Images/toiletlift.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="60" ALT="toiletlift.gif">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER>And at the bathroom, you find a line of women that makes you think</CENTER>
<CENTER>there's a half-price sale on Mel Gibson's underwear in there.</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER>So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, also crossing</CENTER>
<CENTER>their legs and smiling politely. And you finally get closer.</CENTER>
<CENTER>You check for feet under the stall doors.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="Images/toiletpaper.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="67" ALT="toiletpaper.gif">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER>Every one is occupied. You hope no one is doing frivolous things behind</CENTER>
<CENTER>those stall doors, like blowing her nose or checking the contents of her</CENTER>
<CENTER>wallet. Finally, a stall door opens and you dash, nearly knocking down</CENTER>
<CENTER>the woman leaving the stall. You get in to find the door won't latch.</CENTER>
<CENTER>It doesn't matter. You hang your handbag on the door hook,</CENTER>
<CENTER>yank down your pants and assume...</CENTER>
<BR>
 <CENTER><B>The Stance.</B></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

 <CENTER>Relief. More relief. Then your thighs begin to shake. You'd love to sit</CENTER>
<CENTER>down but you certainly hadn't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet</CENTER>
<CENTER>paper on it, so you hold The Stance as your thighs experience a quake</CENTER>
<CENTER>that would register an eight on the Richter scale. To take your mind</CENTER>
<CENTER>off it, you reach for the toilet paper. Might as well be ready when you</CENTER>
<CENTER>are done. The toilet paper dispenser is empty. Your thighs shake more.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>

 <CENTER>You remember the tiny napkin you wiped your fingers on after eating</CENTER>
<CENTER>buttered popcorn. It would have to do. You crumble it in the puffiest</CENTER>
<CENTER>way possible. It is still smaller than your thumbnail. Someone pushes</CENTER>
<CENTER>open your stall door because the latch doesn't work and your</CENTER>
<CENTER>pocketbook whams you in the head. "Occupied!" you scream as you</CENTER>
<CENTER>reach out for the door, dropping your buttered popcorn napkin in a</CENTER>
<CENTER>puddle and falling backward, directly onto the toilet seat. You get up</CENTER>
<CENTER>quickly, but it's too late. Your bare bottom has made contact with all</CENTER>
<CENTER>the germs and life forms on the bare seat because YOU never laid</CENTER>
<CENTER>down toilet paper, not that there was any, even if you had enough time</CENTER>
<CENTER>to. And your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew,</CENTER>
<CENTER>because her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because,</CENTER>
<CENTER>frankly, "You don't know what kind of diseases you could get."</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="Images/toiletpaper.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="67" ALT="toiletpaper.gif">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>

 <CENTER>And by this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so</CENTER>
<CENTER>confused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a</CENTER>
<CENTER>fountain and then it suddenly sucks everything down with such force</CENTER>
<CENTER>that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being</CENTER>
<CENTER>dragged to China. At that point, you give up. You're finished peeing.</CENTER>
<CENTER>You're soaked by the splashing water. You're exhausted. You try to</CENTER>
<CENTER>wipe with a Chicklet wrapper you found in your pocket, then slink out</CENTER>
<CENTER>inconspicuously to the sinks. You can't figure out how to operate the</CENTER>
<CENTER>sinks with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and</CENTER>
<CENTER>a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting,</CENTER>
<CENTER>cross-legged and unable to smile politely at this point.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="Images/toiletlift.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="60" ALT="toiletlift.gif">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR> 

 <CENTER>One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are</CENTER>
<CENTER>trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi</CENTER>
<CENTER>River. You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it in the woman's</CENTER>
<CENTER>hand and say warmly, "Here. You might need this." At this time,</CENTER>
<CENTER>you see your spouse, who has entered, used and exited his bathroom</CENTER>
<CENTER>and read a copy of War and Peace while waiting for you.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="Images/toiletpaper.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="67" ALT="toiletpaper.gif">
</CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
 <CENTER>"<I><B>What took you so long</B></I>?" he asks, annoyed. This is when you kick him</CENTER>
<CENTER>sharply in the shin and go home. This is dedicated to all women</CENTER>
<CENTER>everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public toilet.</CENTER>
<BR>
<CENTER> And it finally explains to all you men what takes us so long.</CENTER>
