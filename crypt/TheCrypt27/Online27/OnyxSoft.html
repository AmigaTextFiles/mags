 <B>1995</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">OnyxSoft was formed during an examwork between <I>Stefan Blixth</I> and <I>Daniel Westerberg</I>.
This examwork consisted of a equalizer box which was controlled by a software (<B>GUI</B>) on
the Amiga. The work got the name : Amigalizer. Daniel made the electronic and
Stefan did the programming.</P>

 <B>1996</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The examwork was finished and presented and got pretty much attention from the audience.
This year, the first program was released. This was <B>Detris</B>, a Tetris clone that worked
in a window on Workbench.</P>

<B>1997</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This year, the first really useful tools was released.
 <B>BookCon</B>, <B>DRemind</B> and <B>DECH</B> was some of the tools that was presented and we got very good
response from all over the world (<I>which got us to create even more tools</I>).</P>

 <B>1998</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">This year, the first mailing list was created and a proper homepage was established
Our software started to appear i magazines and on a lot of CD's. We got a lot of
response from users that liked our software. We also got a lot of ideas from users
and released a lot of new software : <B>OnyxBase</B>, <B>FileCleaner</B>, <B>8SVXtoXXX</B> and <B>TIPic</B> is just
some of those.</P>

 <B>1999</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">OnyxSoft got a new member : <I>Anders Ericsson</I>, which had a lot of new ideas.
We now got our own domain : <A HREF="http://www.onyxsoft.nu">www.onyxsoft.nu </A>and the number of hits started to increase
since we released a number of new (cool) titles this year, like : <B>TheMPegEncGUI</B>, <B>MultiRen</B>,
 <B>QuickNote</B>, <B>3D-ObjectED</B> and a lot of totaly re-written programs.
Our programs has now become very common in magazines and some even won prices <B>;-)</B></P>

 <B>2000</B><BR>
 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Jon Peterson makes a show report for us from The Gateway Computer Show-Amiga 2K in St. Louis
This made our homepage to achieve more than 4000 hits in a couple of days <B>;-)</B>, thanks Jon!
The year was pretty busy by all sorts of projects, many updates where presented but no real
new product or major release... (<I>They are on the way</I>) <B>;-)</B></P>

 <B>2001</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A very busy year that have resulted in few updates, but we are trying our best to fill the gap.
We are heading for the next generation Amiga, so you can count on us for the future :)</P>
