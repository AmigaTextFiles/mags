encyclopedia of helpful background information.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Add to that around 80 locations to visit, six thousand voice lines to 
intercat with, there should be plenty to keep everyone happy without the

<FONT COLOR=YELLOW><CENTER>Amiga Forever V5.0 - The Amiga Emulator CD-ROM</CENTER>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga Forever is the all-in-one Amiga emulation and connectivity 
environment for PCs, officially licensed by Amiga International. We are 
pleased to announce the release of Amiga Forever 5.0. This new version 
includes version 3.1 of the Amiga ROM and OS files and AGA support 
under WinUAE. Additional preinstalled programs and features, like for 
example Personal Paint, DirectoryOpus 5.5, TurboText, drag-and-drop 
LhA de-archiving and the ToolManager dock have been updated.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">New features of Amiga Forever 5.0 include:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- Just-in-time (JIT) version of emulation software, carefully configured
  and publicly benchmarked by Cloanto to be 30 times faster than in
  previous versions of Amiga Forever </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- Software Manager, an advanced content delivery system developed by
  Cloanto, for easy and privacy-conscious management of all
  emulation-related components (updates, downloads, news, etc.)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- All software tested on Windows XP </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- New and fully licensed Picasso96 software (not a shareware version) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Latest version of WinUAE and WinFellow tested by Cloanto </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- CDTV and CD³²  boot ROMs and extended ROMs (can be used to play 
CDTV
  and CD³² games, even booting directly from CD-ROM)*</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Dozens of other enhancements and new add-ons</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to fully exploit the most recent DirectX technologies, support for 
Windows NT 4.0 has been dropped. Amiga Forever 5.0 runs on Windows 
95,Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The 
Mac version of the emulation software is considered "experimental", and 
is not directly supported by Cloanto. Linux sources and binaries are 
included, but require additional technical skills, compared to the one-click 
ease of use provided by Amiga Forever under Windows.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Version 5.0 also includes the following features of version 4.0: </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- MPEG-1 videos: The Deathbed Vigil (one hour and 58 minutes, i.e. the
  full version of this "must have" video) and Jay Miner Speech
  (49 minutes)* </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- GlowIcons look (as used in Amiga OS "3.5", "3.9" and "XL", but also
  compatible with NewIcons and MagicWB)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- Option to switch entire environment from "new look" (GlowIcons) to
  "old look" (Classic) and vice versa </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- Amiga Explorer 4.0 (includes revolutionary self-install over serial
  cable, plus new Cut, Copy, Paste functions) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Directory Opus 5.5 (courtesy of GPSoftware) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Personal Paint 7.1b </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Built-in support for ADZ and DMS disk image files </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- Print spooler (easily print all Amiga documents under Windows,
  bypassing parallel port emulation) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- New MenuBox launcher</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- New emulation and Workbench configuration results in faster
  emulation of the Amiga CPU </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Version 5.0 also includes the following features of version 3.0: </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- Amiga 3.1 ROM and OS files (the last ROM that will ever be available
  for the "Classic Amiga"!) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- TurboText (exclusive latest version with stack problem fix) </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- More than a dozen preinstalled add-ons (drag-and-drop LhA,
  ToolManager, etc.)</P>


<CENTER>Amiga Forever 5.0 also includes the following features of
Amiga Forever 1.0, released in 1997:</CENTER>
<BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- "First Amiga notebook" (officially recognized by Amiga/Gateway and
  licensed to use the "Powered by Amiga" logo)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- "Fastest Amiga" (benchmarked by Cloanto on Alpha CPU)</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- "First Amiga with transparent support for virtual memory"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">- "Most compatible Amiga" (e.g. USB mouse and keyboard, all display
  and sound cards, Fast and Gbit Ethernet, etc.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amiga Forever contains state of the art software to satisfy two major 
needs of many Amiga users: to share data between Amiga and other 
systems, and to use their existing Amiga software and data on non-Amiga 
hardware. Additionally, software, tutorial and reference files which are 
likely to be of interest to any Amiga enthusiast are included with the CD-
ROM. </P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If all you need is access to files on your PC from your Amiga then our 
award winning Network PC is for you. A simple Amiga to PC Networking 
system that allows an Amiga to read and write to a PC. The Amiga can 
read & write to and from any drives on the physically mounted on the PC 
or remotely mounted from an existing network.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system is fast and simple to set-up and comes complete with all 
software required on both floppy disk and compact disc for the Amiga and 
PC. It is also complete with the required cable. Network PC transfers data 
via the parallel ports on the two computers and is thus very fast when 
compared to null modem cables and yet is no more expensive.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The complete kit contains a 3m cable, two floppy disks, one CD and full 
instructions on setting and running Network PC. The CD also contains 
many extras that enhance the system and help you really make use of the 
powerful networking facilities provided.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does it work? Well the PC runs a simple DOS server program under 
Windows 95/98. Windows 95 or 98 ensure that the PC can cope with the 
Amiga's long filename system and allow the Network PC Server to 
multitask with other programs. On the Amiga a simple icon is run to 
'mount' the PC on the Amiga. On Workbench an icon labeled 'PC' is 
mounted and inside there is a drawer for each of the PC's drives. So to 
access the 'c' drive from the PC on the Amiga the path would be 'PC:c/'.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Workbench programs capable of reading volumes mounted on the 
Amiga will be able to read from and write to the PC drives. For example 
you do not need to copy data over to the Amiga to work on it, just use 
your Amiga programs to load the data directly from the PC into the Amiga 
and then save it directly out to the PC when you are finished.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Network PC is capable of running at over 45k/sec and is the fastest 
solution for a cost effective way to share data between an Amiga and a 
PC available.</P></font></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=AQUA>
