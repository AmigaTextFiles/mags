<P ALIGN="LEFT">A vampire bat came flapping in from the night, face all covered in fresh
blood and parked himself on the roof of the cave to get some sleep.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Pretty soon all the other bats smelt the blood and began hassling him about where he got it.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">He told them to bugger off and let him get some sleep, but they persisted until he finally gave in.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"OK, follow me", he said, and flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats
behind him.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Down through a valley they went, across a river and into a huge forest of
trees.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly milled around him,
tongues hanging out for blood.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Do you see that large oak tree over there?" </B>he asked.</P>
