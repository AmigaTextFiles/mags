<P ALIGN="LEFT">Mildred  was  a 93-year-old woman who was particularly  despondent
over the recent death of her husband,  Earl.  She decided that she
would  just kill herself and join him in death.  Thinking that  it
would  be  best to get it over with quickly,  she took out  Earl's
old  Army  pistol and made the decision to shoot  herself  in  the
heart, since it was so badly broken in the first place.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Not  wanting  to miss the vital organ and become a  vegetable  and
burden someone,  she called her doctor's office to inquire  as  to
just exactly where the heart would be on a woman.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">An  Afghanistan diplomat visiting the US for the  first  time  was
being  wined and dined by the State Department.  The diplomat  was
not  used  to the salt in American foods (<I>French fries,   cheeses,
salami,   anchovies,   etc.)</I>    and  was  constantly  sending  his
manservant Abdul to fetch him a glass of water.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Time  and again,  Abdul would scamper off and return with a  glass
of water,  but then one time he returned empty handed. <B>"Abdul, you
son of an ugly camel, where is my water?"</B> demanded the diplomat.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>A  thousand pardons,  O Illustrious One</I>," stammered the  wretched
Abdul, "<I>but a man is sitting on the well!</I>"</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Graveyard Shift</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>In Victorian times, there was an intense fear of being buried alive, so when someone died, a small hole was dug from the casket to the surface, then a string was tied around the dead persons finger which was then attached to a small but loud bell that was hung on the surface of the grave, so then if someone was buried alive, they could ring the bell and whomever was on duty would go and dig them up. Someone was on the clock 24 hours a day - hence the grave yard shift. </I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A  nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.  <I>"I used some
horrible  language  this week and feel absolutely  terrible  about
it."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"When did you use this awful language?"</B> asks the elder.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"Well,  I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like
it  was  going to go over 280 yards,  but it struck a  phone  line
that  is  hanging over the fairway and fell straight down  to  the
ground after going only about 100 yards."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Is that when you swore?"</B></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"No,  Mother," </I>says the nun.  <I>"After that,  a squirrel ran out  of
the  bushes  and  grabbed my ball in its mouth and  began  to  run
away."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Is THAT when you swore?"</B> asks the Mother Superior again.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"Well,  no."</I> says the nun.  <I>"You see, as the squirrel was running,
an  eagle came down out of the sky,  grabbed the squirrel  in  his
talons and began to fly away!"</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Is THAT when you swore?" </B>asks the amazed elder nun.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"No,   not  yet.  As the eagle carried the squirrel  away  in  its
claws, it flew near the green and the Squirrel dropped my ball."</I></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Did you swear THEN?"</B> asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>"No,  because the ball fell on a big rock,  bounced over the  sand
trap,   rolled onto the green,  and stopped about six inches  from
the hole."</I></P>
