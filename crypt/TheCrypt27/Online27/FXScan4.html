<P ALIGN="LEFT">fxSCAN was created with the idea of an easy-to-use and intuitive, 
yet powerful and fast scanning software in mind. The result is a 
scanning software, with which you can manage with ease all scanning-
related tasks via one program and one interface. </P>

<B>Scanning </B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">fxSCAN supports a wide range of scanners by directly using the 
popular and free Betascan-drivers or an already installed ScanQuix®. 
Scanning itself requires you to set only the scan-mode, -resolution 
and -area, so you scan only what you want to. After scanning, the 
picture is in the main memory and you can proceed working with it. </P>

<B>PDF-Export</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Digitalization of documents for flexible use, e.g. on websites or 
delivery via email, has become more and more important over the last 
few years.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Until now AMIGA-users could create PDF-documents from scans only 
with comparably high efforts, and then again, mostly uncompressed 
and therefore not suitable for delivery due to their filesizes. 
One "solution" for this problem was to send scans as image files, 
but printing these was tricky for users of other platforms (cut 
borders, print-out too small, format couldn´t be read, "gigantic" 
size on screen, etc.). </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Over the last few years, the PDF-format has become a platform-
independant standard format for the exchange of documents and can be 
viewed and printed without problems on a variety of systems. 
fxSCAN´s PDF-export now finally allows you to create a compressed 
PDF-file from a scan, with few mouseclicks, a friendly interface and 
in a couple of seconds.</P> 

<B>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It was awaited for a long time, now its finally there: OCR on the 
AMIGA! fxSCAN contains an OCR-module (whose recognition-kernel is 
based on the free Linux-OCR gocr) since version 3.0. By continued 
development the already very good recognition-results will further 
improve in the future. For example the recognition-kernel´s version 
0.3.5, which is used in fxSCAN 4.0, has vast improvements in the 
recognition of French and "Norwegian" characters and an overall 
improved character recognition. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The recognition of a page is very simple for the user, though. Just 
drag boxes around text columns and pictures and start the 
recognition process. Unknown or unrecognized characters are 
corrected afterwards and the final result is then saved as text- 
and/or HTML-file. If you use HTML-files, you can even embed pictures 
from the original, order the text in columns like in the original 
and save the font size information. If desired, the text can also be 
overworked automatically for further use: words seperated at the end 
of a line can be joined together automatically and line breaks can 
be removed. This is especially useful if you want to use the same 
text in a different layout or on a website! And thanks to PPC-
support, OCR profits of the higher PPC-speeds. </P>

<B>Copying</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Scan, print, result too dark, expensive ink wasted? Not with fxSCAN! 
The copying function is well thought through here. You can scan a 
preview before copying, perform brightness-, contrast- and gamma-
corrections and then create a copy that fits your expectations. Who 
still needs conventional copy-machines then anyway? </P>

<B>Reworking</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">fxSCAN offers you a wide range of tools for reworking your scanning 
results. Supported by a realtime-preview you reach optimal results 
fast. No matter whether you want to cut pictures precisely, adjust 
the colors, optimize the use of colors, automatically improve your 
scanning results with the color profiles of the calibration software 
ICS or rotate, mirror, scale, blur or sharpen your scans, create a 
negative or a black&white version of your scan, fxSCAN assists you 
in your intention. On AMIGAs with PPC, these operations are by the 
way performed with full PPC-speed! </P>

<B>View & Print</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Of course you can also view and print pictures in fxSCAN. When 
viewing them, you profit of the optimized viewing routines and get 
an overview fast. When printing, you can choose between using the 
driver systems of AmigaOS 3.1, 3.5/3.9 and Turboprint® and get your 
results on paper in short time. </P>

<B>Convert</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">By supporting many formats for loading and saving, the conversion 
between the fileformats is an easy task and done quickly with 
fxSCAN. Thanks to datatypes-support, you can also access nearly any 
image fileformat comfortably. </P>
