<P ALIGN="LEFT">Note Pad utilities are alway a good thing to have when using the Internet, Often people post their email details, but without the ability to link directly from the web browser, Or perhaps you find an interesting URL or piece of text that you want to save for future use.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There is many versions of Note Pad programs available (<I>All good in their own way</I>) but <B>Noteit</B> has several interesting features. The default settings give you a nice small window on your workbench, Which you can configure to your own  Taste (<I>Font and background colours</I>). Messages typed in to <B>Noteit</B> (<I>or entered using</I> <B>"Cut&Paste"</B>) are automatically saved after 10 seconds, However pages in <B>Noteit</B> can easily be deleted (<I>Via the Menu Bar</I>). An excellent little program, Well worth running .Just drop it into your WB Startup drawer to launch it every time you boot, That way you can leave yourself small reminders of tasks you have to do.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Welcome to NoteIt!, a Post-It style notepad program for the 
Commodore Amiga.  Requires Workbench 2.0 or greater.</P>

 
  


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Why did I write it?</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">I have always felt that the Amiga needed a Post-It© style notepad.
Apparently, due to responses from NoteIt! users, others have also
felt it is a need as well.  So, needless to say, I wrote one!</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Admittedly, I haven't needed such a program very often for myself.
I originally started this project to teach myself more about
programming for Amiga intuition.  I've had so much fun with it, plus
enough of responses to deem continue improving it.</P>
 

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Note:</B>  I cannot be responsible for any system crashes caused
       by this program.  :-)  I just hope they don't happen!
       I have tried to thoroughly test this.</P>
<BR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>What's new?</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">Since version 1.4b, these are changes/additions made to NoteIt!.
An asterisk (*) indicates new feature, and others are changes.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
  *  The NoteIt! window is now resizeable.<BR>
  *  A new tooltype for delete-protecting your notefiles.<BR>
  *  Ability to place cursor in text with the click of the mouse.<BR>
  *  Copy text to clipboard (page at a time only).<BR>
  -  Minimization replaced with true iconify.<BR>
  *  A nice icon.  :-)<BR>
  -  Redid the button bar using BOOPSI gadgets instead of Gadtools.<BR>
  -  Rewrote all of the word-wrap routines to be more efficient
     and smaller, as well as a good portion of the rest of the source.<BR>
<BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>What does it do?</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt!'s features include multiple page editing, window iconification,
auto-save of notes, font-sensitivity, and window resizing and positioning..</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Graphical buttons, font-specification through a font requester, 
auto-iconification of the window, and the ability to paste from the 
system clipboard are some of the newer features. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Startup</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt! requires at least Workbench 2.0 to run.  NoteIt! can be
started by either the CLI, or from the Workbench.  Several parameters
are supported to configure NoteIt!.  These parameters are the same
for the CLI as for the Workbench Tooltypes.</P>
<BR>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Tooltypes</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following Tooltypes can either be used as a CLI parameter, or
as a Tooltype set through NoteIt!'s icon information.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Tooltypes are as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>PUBSCREEN</B> ...     You can specify which Public screen NoteIt! will open 
               on with this Tooltype.  If the Public screen does not
               exist, then it will default to the Workbench.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>CONFIGFILE </B> ...   This is the file and pathname of where to save the 
               configuration file.  The default path is the directory
               where NoteIt! was started from.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>NOTEFILE </B>...      This is the file and pathname of where to save the note
               file.  The default path is the program directory of
               NoteIt!.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>DELPROTECT </B> ...   This switch tells NoteIt! to delete protect the notefile.
               If you want to avoid accidently erasing your notes, use
               DELPROTECT. You will not be able to erase the notefile
               without manually changing the file permissions or 
               removing DELPROTECT from the Tooltypes.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The <B>TOP, LEFT, WIDTH,</B> and <B>HEIGHT</B> Tooltypes are no longer supported
because the need for them has been replaced with a resizeable window.</P>
<BR>
         
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Using NoteIt!</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once NoteIt! is open, you can simply start typing text.  NoteIt! 
automatically word-wraps text, so there is no need to use the return
key for each paragraph.  Because of this, NoteIt! also knows when you
start a new paragraph with the return key so that if you change the
size of the window, the text will not wrap awkwardly.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt! supports multiple pages in the window, allowing you to leave 
yourself several messages with only one NoteIt! program running.  
Therefore, NoteIt! will only allow you to run one at a time.  This is 
necessary since having more than one running could erase the notes in 
the notefile with the notes of another.  See below for more on the 
notefiles. The multiple pages can be controlled either by the window
gadgets, or through the menus.</P>

<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Menus</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt! has the following menus:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Project menu ...     About, Iconify, Quit<BR>
   Edit menu....         Paste<BR>
   Navigation menu...   Add Page, Delete Page, etc.<BR>
   Settings menu  ...      Font, Autoiconify, etc.<BR>
<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>




<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Saving</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt! also will save your notes between power cycles.  All notes
will be stored in a file, found either in the program directory where
NoteIt! is located, or the file specified by the NOTEFILE Tooltype.  
Every time NoteIt! is started, if a notefile exists, it will read the 
file and display the first one in the window.  Use Next Page, or 
Previous Page to view any other notes.  See Navigation menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">NoteIt! also saves the notes after approximately 10 seconds of
inactivity, or if the NoteIt! window becomes inactive by selecting
another window or iconifying.  Leaving NoteIt! running until shutting 
power off will not lose messages unless you shut off the power prior 
to the 10 second time period.  Once you close the NoteIt! window, either 
through the close gadget, or through the menu item "Quit", it will 
save any messages.</P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><U>Configuration</U></B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT">Configuring NoteIt! can occur through the use of Tooltypes and the
Settings menu.  Options for fonts, autoiconifying, starting NoteIt!
in iconified form, and having the button bar all are set using
the menus.  Size and position of window are set by simply 
resizing the window and dragging the window do the desired
position. Public screen, and the filenames for the configuration 
and notefiles are all set using Tooltypes.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Once these configuration items are set, they can be saved using the
"Save Settings" item from the Settings menu.  Note that the Tooltypes
will override anything you have saved in the configuration file.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The size and position of the window will be saved when you save 
settings.  Simply position the window anywhere on the screen prior
to saving the settings will then cause that position to be saved.</P></blockquote>
