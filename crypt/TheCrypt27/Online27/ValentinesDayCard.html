   <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Since Valentine's Day is for a Christian saint and we're Jewish," she
 asks, "will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?</I>"</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Melissa's
 father thinks a bit, then says, <B>"No, I don't think God would get mad. Who
do
 you want to give a valentine to?"</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Osama Bin Laden,</I>" she says.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>"Why Osama Bin Laden?"</B> her father asks in
shock.</P>


   <P ALIGN="LEFT">"<I>Well,</I>" she says, "<I>I thought that if a little American Jewish girl could
 have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that
 maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if
 other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone
a
 lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much
 he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore.</I>"</P>
