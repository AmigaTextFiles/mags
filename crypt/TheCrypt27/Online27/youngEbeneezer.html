<CENTER>It's getting 'round to Christmas,  that cheerful time of year,</CENTER>
<CENTER>But I don't give a cuss for it,  and that seems very clear,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You'll all be paid the normal rate, and not one penny more,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And when you think you've finished, there'll be a whole lot more.</CENTER>

<CENTER>No Holiday at Christmas time is certainly the rule,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Instead you should be thanking me, your kids are not at school,</CENTER>
<CENTER>And wedded bliss I've engineered, to save your mortal life,</CENTER>
<CENTER>There's not a man amongst you, that really loves his wife.</CENTER>

<BR>
<CENTER>No frantic chasing round the shops for presents any more,</CENTER>
<CENTER>Cos I have kept you working from yesterday, half past four;</CENTER>
<CENTER>You should be really grateful, for a job that's truly sound,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You're never there to witness when the in-laws come around.</CENTER>

<CENTER>No further interruption during Our Dear Queen's speech,</CENTER>
<CENTER>I need you earning money, I'm a financial leech,</CENTER>
<CENTER>No turkey with the trimmings, just a sausage roll to go,</CENTER>
<CENTER>You're off to yet another place that you don't even know.</CENTER>
