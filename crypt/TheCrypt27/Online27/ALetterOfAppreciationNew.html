<center><h1><font color=red>A Letter Of Appreciation</font></h1></center>

<p class=MsoBodyText>    Suddenly a man wakes up one day and in a voice not to 

  unsimilar to that of John Wayne to say "ok kinkade, it`s time to get on ya horse 

  and drink ya milk, we gotta head into the sun"</p>

<p><i><span>    </span>Or, in my case, it`s time to get off my arse and do some 

  more articles for our mag, y`now, the one that I helped create all those years 

  ago, but a few words of credit first to some folks who are basically the backbone 

  of our mag.</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>On the few occasions (naughty boy) when I visit our website 

  I was bloody amazed at just how far our mag as evolved from it`s earlier days, 

  admittedly, it`s a multi-format mag now, but you have to change with the times 

  don`t you think so. I was sorting out loads of old computer-orientated letters 

  the other day which I had received over some time in the past from my loads 

  of miggy contacts, and one of them just happend to be from our Ed, yep, Ferret, 

  he at the time was the jont editor of the mag at that time called The Ripper, 

  I was making a new contact with him and stated that I was part of The Crypt 

  diskmag which of course at that <span class=GramE>time</span> he had no idea 

  of.</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>He was being taken for a ride by a prat called Barry I 

  think he was called, anyway, Barry was doing hardly nowt, Ferret was working 

  his Scottish testicles off and getting nowhere, so being on the lookout for 

  new talent, I was trying to poach Ferret to join our team, so cutting a long 

  story short, that`s how Ferret got to know us.and the rest is history.</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>Now, at the time, Ray Hawkins and myself first creating 

  our mag which most of you might or might not know was called Bits &amp; Bytes 

  we thought that on the miggy under Workbench was the dogs B$££*&amp;s, and at 

  the time it was.anyway..boring stuff I can imagine for most of you</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>What I`m trying to say in the least tartyish but From 

  The Heart way, is that we`ve come a bloody long way from Rays &amp; mine first 

  creation, and in my own sad little mans own way, I feel proud to be part of 

  such a successful webmag. But I`m the first to admit that in our earlier days 

  I was there for our mag 100%, and at one time did take on two other assistant 

  roles because we were very very understaffed.</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>I reckon nowadays that we might even have someone to wipe 

  Ferrets bum, or to hold his cuppa while he`s busy typing his next article, or 

  someone to wipe the sweat away from the Webmaster forehead while he`s toiling 

  over a Smoking keyboard getting all the article together for our next issue</i></p>

<p><i><span>    </span>Now, wot I`m saying is that as one of the founder members 

  of the mag, ALL the folks involved in it`s completion of every issue are doing 

  a brilliant job, from Ferret &amp; Steve Evans, Ian Urie Francis, in fact Everyone, 

  so keep up the brill work, we`ve come such a long way from the Bits &amp; Bytes 

  days.well done lads<span class=GramE></span></i></p>
