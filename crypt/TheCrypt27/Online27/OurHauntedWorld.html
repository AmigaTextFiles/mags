<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>Ghosts and ghouls and strange happenings abound all over the world.  Every 
country has it's own weird tales to tell - all are reported to be true, told by people 
not given to wild flights of fancy</I>...  <B>What do you think?</B></p>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Africa</B></P>

<B>Death Duty</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In Madagascar, the Malagasy people have bizarre beliefs about death.  They spend 
more money on family tombs than they do their houses.  Some clans even decorate 
the tombs on the inside.  One ceremony in Madagascar is the turning of the bones, 
when relatives remove a special family member from the family tomb, between 4 
and 7 years after their death, to tell them all the latest family gossip.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Other clans have different ideas.  Noblemen from the Sakalava tribe are placed on 
a wooden bench in the hot sun after they die and relatives wait until the body 
decomposes so they can drink the bodily fluids of the dead, in the hope that they 
will be imbued with the deceased best qualities!</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Sorcerers aren't buried, instead they are dumped to the west of their villages, their 
necks twisted to face south, and sprinkled with soil so that dogs can eat them!</P>

<B>Can You Stomach It?</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">King Radama I, who was a harsh ruler in the 1800s, had a revolting method of 
testing whether an accused criminal was guilty or not.  It was called the Ordeal of 
Tangena.  Tangena is a highly poisonous shrub, and the King would extract the 
poison and mix it into a meal of three pieces of chicken skin and rice. The suspect 
had the meal forced down his throat and had to wait until they vomited.  If the 
person was innocent, all three pieces of chicken skin came up again, if they hadn't 
already died because of the poison, they were freed.  If, however, the skins settled 
in the suspect's stomach, they were considered to be guilty and allowed to die a 
very unpleasant death!</P>

<B>Ship Graveyard</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Skeleton Coast is Namibia got it's name from the skeletons along it's 
treacherous coastline and the desert beyond.  It has for centuries been one vast 
graveyard for unlucky or unwary ships and their crews.  Shipwrecked sailors, lucky 
to make it alive to the shore, had very little chance of surviving the baking desert 
walk to civilisation. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">The  Dunedin Star, which sank there in 1942, with 21 
passengers and 85 crew on board, was one of the worst shipwrecks reported so far.  
Conditions were so bad that even the rescue boat ran aground into the rocks and a 
rescue plane nose-dived into the sea.  A rusty fuel tank from the ship's cargo has 
joined the pieces of other wrecks on the coastline, as a grim memorial to the lives 
lost.</P>

<B>Hill Spirits</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The spirits in the Tsodilo Hills in the Kalahari Desert are still very much alive.  
Bushmen carved thousands of animal paintings on the rocks centuries ago and ever 
since myths, legends and spirits have surrounded them.  Laurens Van der Post, a 
famous explorer, was filming at the site when some strange things began 
happening around him.</P>

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Every morning, huge hordes of angry bees swarmed and 
attacked him, and whenever he attempted to film, the cameras jammed.  Van der 
Post's assistant who was a native of the area, told him the spirits of the hills were 
probably punishing him for not respecting their ancient resting place. He then 
wrote a formal letter of apology, asking for forgiveness, addressed it to the 'Spirits 
of the Hills' and placed it in a bottle next to a rock painting.  The next morning he 
visited the area with his cameras, and the bees did not return, and the equipment 
worked perfectly!</P>

<B>Strange Creature</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In 1997, villages in the Eastern Cape were buzzing with some horrifying news that 
a creature, half fish and half horse, had eaten seven locals.  The attack happened in 
the Umzimhalva River.  Government officials reported that the villagers descriptions 
came close to a beast from tribal mythology, which lives in rivers and provides 
great wealth if caught, called a mamlambo.  It came as no surprise that a 
government official ordered workers into the area to track down the river beast and 
capture it!  Unfortunately for him, the odd-looking creature was not sighted again.
</P>
<B>The Dogon People</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Dogon people probably first lived in North Africa, on the borders of Egypt, but 
between 1300 and 1600, they moved and settled in West Africa.  They made their  
home in the 145 kilometre long Bandiagara Cliff, which is in present day Mali.  
Around two million descendents still live there.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They built multi-storey houses with flat mud roofs, and granaries with pointed straw 
roofs, in villages arranged in the shape of a human body, on the steep cliffside.  
The men's meeting house is in the head, the family houses are the veins and 
arteries that carry blood around the body.  Each of the mud and straw houses 
represent a body - the kitchen is the head and the bedrooms are the arms. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Gods 
and ancestors are carved on their doors to protect the buildings and their contents. 
They have a complex religion which involves a variety of spectacular rituals and 
dances.  They are animalists, who believe that spirits live in all the objects around 
them, including animals, birds and trees.  They believe they were created by a god 
called Amma, who made just four men and four women, who are their ancestors.  
The first male ancestor is the most important, as he turned into a snake when he 
died.  Their history is explained in the Sigi ceremony, which takes place every 60 
years.  The Dogon carve a snake mask which they call the 'iminana', and use it in a 
variety of dances to tell their history.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">They are also expert astronomers.  The 
Dogon claim that their knowledge of the heavens was taught to them long ago by 
creatures from outer space who lived both on land and in water.  Other rituals 
commemorate the arrival of aliens from outer space, who supposedly visited the 
Dogon thousands of years ago.  They say that the aliens originated from Sirius and 
landed in Mali.  The aliens were amphibious and called themselves the Nommo.  
The Nommo told the Dogon that Sirius was orbited by two smaller stars.  In 1920, 
astronomers discovered that Sirius did have one star, but as yet a second still has to 
be discovered.  Two French experts who studied the Dogons between 1930 and 
1940 believed their story of space visitors.  Other investigators suggested that the 
Dogon learnt of Sirius from French missionaries or the ancient Egyptians, or could 
be based on the fish-god legends of the ancient Babylonians.</P>

<B>Tales of the Sahara</B><BR>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Sahara in North Africa is the largest desert in the world, formed from f\great 
expanses of sand and rock and stretches for more than 5,000km across 13 
countries, from Mauritania to Egypt.  It is also the hottest place on Earth with the 
highest record temperature of 58 degrees centigrade taken in Libya in 1922. There 
is obviously very little water and few plants grow except in oases.  Experts believe 
that at the end of the last Ice Age, around 11,000 years ago, rain began to fall in 
North Africa.  As a result, lakes formed and grass grew until it covered most of the 
desert as we know it.</P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">Around 5,000 years ago, the rivers dried up, forcing the 
people and animals which inhabited the area to leave.  All sorts of animals are 
known to have lived there from ostriches to hippos which were hunted by the local 
people.  Now only the art of those ancient people remains. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">French soldiers in 
Algeria made a series of amazing finds, in 1847, starting with some rock paintings.  
Thousands of sketches have been made and pictures taken of these painting over 
the years.  Together they cover 1500 square metres, of varying scenes from the 
animals which roamed the area to the development of the tribes which also lived 
there.</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">The scenes show hunters equipped with bow and arrows hunting elephants 
and a species of buffalo, now extinct, through to people herding giraffes and cattle 
and on to horses pulling chariots and men riding on them, and finally to camels.
The pictures have been dated and range from between 10,000 years ago to the 
latest at 2,000 years old.  The last paintings show the desert was forming and fewer 
animals as the heat was increasing. </P>



<B>Lion Kill</B><BR>
The Gilbert family had spent thousands on the best guide, food and equipment for 
their dream holiday on safari in South Africa.  On their first day, they spotted 
rhinos, giraffes, hippos and zebras, and Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert marvelled at the 
beauty of them all.  But all their young son, George could do was moan and 
whine.  He wanted to see a lion and thought everything else was dull and boring.  
The guide told him he would see a lion when he least expected it and when he 
did, he would never forget it.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">For a whole week, George moaned and whinged, saying he preferred to play on his 
GameBoy in the camp, then to travel around the countryside, looking at the same 
animals every day.  Eventually, his parents gave in in despair, so they agreed to let 
him stay at the camp while they went out on safari, and could enjoy the trip in 
peace.  For once, George was happy, as he sat in his tent, playing a game on the 
GameBoy.  'They'll never see a lion,' he thought, <B>'I'm much better off here than 
going out to be bored and disappointed again.'</B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">He'd hardly finished the level on the game, before he heard the roar of a lion - 
outside his tent!  He turned around just in time to see a lioness pounce on him.  
She grabbed hold of George by the ankle and dragged him through miles of 
undergrowth to finally drop him on the ground in front of her pack of five hungry 
cubs, waiting for a meal. </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Luckily for George, his parents had already spotted the hungry cub pack and were 
waiting for the mother to arrive with food, so they had driven up closer for a better 
look.  Their excitement turned to horror when they realised their son was going to 
be the meal.  Thankfully, the guide had his tranquilliser dart already loaded as 
usual 
in case of emergency, and shot the lioness. </P>

 <P ALIGN="LEFT">George managed to scramble up and 
stagger to the safety of the jeep before the lioness woke.
George spent the last week of the holiday in hospital, recovering from his ordeal.  
One of his Get Well cards came from the safari guide, who had written, <B>'I told you 
that you'd see a lion when you least expected it, and that you would never forget 
it!'</B></P>


<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I>That's all for this issue, see you next time when we visit another country with 
strange customs and happenings</I>.</P>
