<p><b><FONT SIZE="+2">
December 1st, 2002:</font></b> It saddens me greatly to announce that, 
effective today, any of my Amiga-related software development has been
mothballed indefinitely. This means that, pending any unexpected
developments, there won't be any "Amithlon v2" (aka "Berniethlon"), 
nor any further support or add ons for "Amithlon v1" by me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have almost two years of my time invested in Amithlon/Berniethlon, and 
a lot of it was <a href="http://www.amithlon.net/fun.shtml">fun</a>. However, the last nine months
have been a complete nightmare. I have been lied to, lied about,
threatened, libelled and abused, and have had my IP rights violated.
Worse yet, the self-styled <a href="http://www.vmc.de"> "Founder and 
Developer of Amithlon"</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.amithlon.com">
former distributor</a> have apparently also taken it upon themselves to 
threaten and intimidate anyone who so much as considers cooperating 
with me --- be that Amiga dealers, the P96 team, Chris Hodges, or the 
<a href="http://www.boing.net">provider</a> for
<a href="http://www.amithlon.net">www.amithlon.net</a>.</p>

<p>I am a stubborn old fool, which is the only reason I have put up with
that sort of harrassment for so long. But no matter how stubborn I am,
it gets to me. Oh, does it ever get to me! The last few months, I have
only been able to go to sleep if I was completely and utterly exhausted ---
and then would wake up too early, and be fatigued the whole day. 
And most mornings I would wake up
wanting to scream, and to put my head through the plaster wall, just to
forget about this whole crap for a few seconds. After a few months of
that, I simply can't go on. </p>

<p>It's not just me who suffers, either --- due
to the constant interference by H&P and HF, I have been unable to earn
any money from my work on "Berniethlon"... That money was meant to take
me and my girlfriend to Germany for Christmas, so my family could finally
get to meet the woman in my life. Alas, no sales, no money, no trip.
Disappointment and distress all round. And, trust me on this one, wanting
to put your head through the wall is not one of the most sought-after
qualities in a boyfriend, either.</p>

<p>So, this crap <b>has</b> to stop. 
And as the other parties have made it absolutely
clear that they have no intention of relenting, <b>I</b> have to call it quits.
I will make one last set of off-site backups of all the important code,
and then simply remove it from my disks. I will take apart and reuse my test
machine, and start working on something completely different. To quote
Ludwig von Beethoven: "Applaud, friends, the comedy is over".</p>
<hr>
<p>A few more things --- as far as I am concerned, AmigaOS XL as (still)
distributed by H&P contains my IP without a license. According to the
last communication I had from Amiga Inc, it also contains their IP without
a license (please note that I cannot verify the veracity of that claim;
I am simply passing on what I have been told). Further unresolved IP issues 
exist with regards to the AmigaOS XL package. Thus, if you consider 
respect for intellectual property important (and let's face it, a market
as small as the Amiga one is certainly doomed if you don't), I must
strongly advise against purchasing AmigaOS XL. If you are looking for a
commercial and fully licensed package to run Amiga software on the PC,
I can only recommend <a href="http://www.cloanto.com">Cloanto's</a>
excellent package <a href="http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/forever/">
Amiga Forever 5</a>.</p>

<p>Also, have a look <a href="http://www.amithlon.net/closedown.shtml">here</a> if you are wondering
why I closed down this site. No, it's not (just) because the bandwidth
costs money.</p>
<p>If you have always wondered who did what for Amithlon, have a look
at a <a href="http://www.amithlon.net/whodunnit.shtml">breakdown</a> I prepared a few months
ago. Please note that <b>I</b> prepared it, and that there is every
chance that one prepared by Mr. Frank would look different.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you are interested in seeing my comments and thoughts on the
aftermath of this (and in seeing how things are going in general),
have an occasional look at <a
href="http://www.umilator.net">http://www.umilator.net</a> (guess what
"Berniethlon" was going to be called :), which I intend to turn into a
personal weblog site during December.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is indeed a very sad day for me. I consider this outcome a horrible
waste that does not benefit anyone, least of all you, the users. Let me
close by expressing my sincerest gratitude and appreciation for each and
every supportive email I have received, each encouraging word that has been
sent my way, and most of all, for the joy you have given me through your
appreciation of my work. And while at this point, I can't help but mourn
for what could have been, I hope that some day, I will instead think of
Amithlon and rejoice at what was.... </p>
