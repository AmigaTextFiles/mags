ROM  and Microphone only (box is for display purposes only).   The
software  manual  is available on the CD-ROM  itself  and  can  be
printed.  This is a FULL version of the software.  This is  not  a

 <CENTER><B>How It Works</B></CENTER>
<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Naturally  Speaking  is  an incredibly powerful  program  that  is
amazingly  easy  to  use.  Simply install the  Naturally  Speaking
software, and follow the step-by-step prompts.</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">You  will be asked to perform a series of voice recognition tests,
so  that  the software can adjust to your specific speech pattern.
After  set-up  had  been completed,  you simply  speak  into  your
microphone,   and  the  Naturally Speaking  software  will  "type"
everything you say, word for word. It's just that easy!</P>
