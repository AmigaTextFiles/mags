<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women have strengths that amaze men. They carry children, 
they carry hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold 
happiness, love and joy.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want 
to cry.  </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They cry when they are happy, and laugh when they are 
nervous. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women wait by the phone for a "safe at home call" from a 
friend, after a snowy drive home. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They are child care workers, executives, attorneys, stay-at-
home moms, biker babes, and your neighbors. They wear suits, 
jeans, and they wear uniforms. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They fight for what they believe in. They stand up against 
injustice. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They walk and talk the extra mile to get their kids and to 
get their family the right health care. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They go to the doctor with a frightened friend. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women are honest, loyal, and forgiving. They are smart -- 
they know that knowledge is power. </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">But they still know how to use their softer side to make a 
point. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women want to be the best for their family, their friends, 
and themselves.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Their hearts break when a friend dies. They have sorrow at 
the loss of a family member, yet they are strong when they 
think there is no strength left. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A woman can make a romantic evening unforgettable. </P>
 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women come in all sizes, in all colors and shapes. </P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">They live in houses, apartments and cabins. They drive, fly, 
walk, run or e-mail you to show how much they care about you.</P> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The heart of a woman is what makes the world spin! </P>
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Women do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope.</P> 
  
<P ALIGN="LEFT">They give compassion and ideals. They give moral support to 
their family and friends. And all they want in return is a 
hug, a smile, and for you to do the same for people you come 
in contact with.</P>
