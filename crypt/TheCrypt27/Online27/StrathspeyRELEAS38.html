<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>The Strathspey 

  Steam Railway has had the most successful year in its history following the 

  re-opening of the line between Boat of Garten and Broomhill on the 31st May 

  this year with passenger journeys to the end of October up by 24%.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>In 1974 when 

  the enthusiasts of the Strathspey Railway Company set about the task of reopening 

  the line between Aviemore and Grantown on Spey little did they realise that 

  it would be over 25 years before they reached Broomhill, the halfway point between 

  Boat of Garten and Grantown. History will show that there were many factors 

  involved most of which, such as downturns in the economy and the growth of foreign 

  travel as against holidaying at home, were out of the hands of the dedicated 

  band of railwaymen and women who were running the Strathspey Railway.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>In recent years 

  the steam railway has made great strides forward, including moving into the 

  main station at Aviemore in 1999 and the return to traffic of Ivatt class 2, 

  <st1:date Year="2000" Day="6" Month="2">2-6-0</st1:date> mixed traffic locomotive number 46512 in 2001. 46512 is now named 

  E V Cooper after one of the founders of the Strathspey Railway Company. However, 

  the biggest event in the history of the railway since train services were first 

  restarted on <st1:date Year="1978" Day="22" Month="7">July 

  22nd 1978</st1:date> took place on <st1:date

Year="2002" Day="31" Month="5">Friday 31st May 2002</st1:date> when train services began running from Aviemore to Broomhill after 

  an absence of some 35 years.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'><b>GLENBOGLE TICKET SUCCESS.</b><b></b></p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>Broomhill station 

  is used as Glenbogle for that world-wide television success Monarch of the 

  Glen. The last filming of the most recent series taking 

  place only a few weeks before the station re-opened to the public. So successful 

  has the Glenbogle connection been that the specially printed Glenbogle platform 

  ticket has outsold the combined platform ticket sales of Aviemore, Boat of Garten 

  and Broomhill, out of a total of 2,471 sold 1,529 have been Glenbogle tickets, 

  that is nearly 2 out of every 3.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'><b>TOTAL 

  TICKETS SOLD UP - RETURN JOURNEYS UP.</b></p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>The success is 

  not confined to platform tickets, from the opening 

  day to Broomhill until the end of the season on the 31st October the number 

  of tickets sold is up almost 20% (compared to the same period in 2001) at 38,431. 

  Passenger journeys at 79,274 (which is the way railways measure their year) 

  are also up by 24% which indicates that since Broomhill opened more passengers 

  are making return journeys.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'><b>AVIEMORE/</b></p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'><b>AVIEMORE STATION BUSIER BUT 

  BOAT OF GARTEN QUIETER.</b></p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>The changes brought 

  about by the opening of Broomhill are most noticeable in the increase in the 

  number of visitors starting their journey at Aviemore and the decline in the 

  number at Boat of Garten the former terminus. Almost three-quarters of all tickets 

  sold on the railway are sold at Aviemore, approximately 17% at Boat of Garten 

  (36% in 2001) and nearly 9% at Broomhill. It remains to be seen if more people 

  use Broomhill station next year as it becomes better known and when the road 

  signs are in position. </p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>Passengers are 

  of course encouraged to break their journey at Boat of Garten and for next year 

  there will be the added attraction of the Beechgrove Community Garden project 

  next door to the station. Boat of Garten offers convenient access before or 

  after a trip on the train to the Speyside Way 

  walking route and to the RSPB Osprey Reserve at Loch Garten. For passengers 

  alighting at Broomhill there is a signposted walk into Nethy Bridge.</p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'><b>AND NEXT YEAR?</b><b></b></p>

<p class=DefaultText style='text-align:justify'>Plans are already 

  in hand to develop next years services. These include a new timetable which 

  will take into account the lessons learned during 2002, another steam engine, 

  currently under restoration, is planned to be back in service by mid summer 

  and Friday lunch trains will operate during the summer months in addition to 

  those on Sundays throughout the season. The evening diner train, The Strathspey 

  Highlander, is to have an extended season from early June until mid-September. 

  The children will be pleased to know that Thomas coming back in May and again 

  in August.</p>
