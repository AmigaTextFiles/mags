<LI> In the March edition of the magazine Com-Digit reported that the software manufacturer Corel had announced to release
the program package Corel Office in a version for the Next Generation Amiga.
</LI>
<BR><LI> In the moment it is not absolutely clear, if AMIGA will ship the planned developer system with an &quot;Amiga on
a card&quot; for the PCI slot. AMIGA president Jim Collas intimated, that AMIGA PCI has not been definitely cancelled.
Circles of the company Siamese Systems Limited, which is involved into this project previously mentioned, that AMIGA
cancelled the PCI project.

<BR><LI> AMIGAs Internet-Homepages <A HREF="http://www.amiga.de" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.amiga.de</A> und <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.amiga.com</A>
  are of the same content, now. The pages are designed by Matthias Grohman, an employee of the German AMIGA branch office.
</LI>
<BR><LI> The AMIGA officials have different opinions, who is to blame for the standstill. In an interview Petro Tyschtschenko,
manager of the German AMIGA branch office indirectly blamed the former head of the American development department for the standstill
of Amiga OS 3.5. The AMIGA president Jim Collas blames the mother company Gateway, that didn't support enough the Amiga. Jeff
Schindler, former president of AMIGA, Inc. was not to blame.
</LI>
<BR><LI> In the same interview Petro Tyschtscheko said that Jim Collas will come to Germany this month.
</LI>
<BR><LI> It is said, that an inofficial alpha version of Amiga OS 3.5 is to be released this month, while a first beta
version is planned for May. Amiga OS 3.5 is to be shipped to the customer in August.
</LI>
<BR><LI> According to the 'Frequenctly asked questions' (FAQ) of AMIGA regarding Amiga OS 3.5 the price for the upgrade of
the operating system is at 49.95 US-Dollars resp. 98 DEM. Who converts the price now might notice, that the American
customers get Amiga OS 3.5 much cheaper than the German resp. European users, who have to pay approx. 10 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euros)
more. If these plans become reality, this would be a very questionate price politics, because it is not to expect for the
US-Dollar to raise up to 2 DEM (remark of the translator: Currently the US-Dollar is at approx. 1.80 DEM)
