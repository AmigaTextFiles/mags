<H2>7. Supplemental to the Napalm test by Manni Froitzheim (by Manni Froitzheim)</H2>
<P>
A short supplemental to Napalm, from me.
</P>
<P>
Recently we (from the AUGDD) tried to play Napalm via null modem.
</P>
<P>
It is quite easy:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Connect null modem cable to each of the serial ports
</LI>
<BR><LI> Start Napalm, select Network in the menu
</LI>
<BR><LI> Choose humanity resp. the robots
</LI>
<BR><LI> the connection is made immediately
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
This works fine to that moment, when the opponent is shown on the particular
monitor. Then the connection is terminated immediately.
</P>
<P>
We tested this a number of times in various combinations, the connection
is immediately aborted, if the opponent is show. In addition to the given
penalty points there is one fat more, not just because the game is not much
fun, you can't play Napalm versus another (yet).
</P>
<P>
Dear company clickBOOM, the whole game is a cheek and the height of impudence !!!!!!!!!!
</P>
<P>
Due to fairness I have to say, that Napalm was presented as C&amp;C clone (I
don't know this game) and had to know, what to expect, a reproach some people
made to me. I don't care,  what type of clone a game is. I own an Amiga and
don't play on the PC! Maybe my lack of understanding regarding Napalm comes
from that, but I don't take anything back from that, what I said ! It has
been and will be a terrible game !
</P>
<P>
Test computers were:
</P>
<P>
A1200 with Blizzard PPC 603e (160/060/50),BVisionPPC 64 MB RAM
A4000 with Cyberstorm PPC 604e (233/060/50),PicassoIV,112 MB RAM

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Remark:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">It is most likely, that clickBOOM didn't want, that Napalm can't be played in a network.
So it seems to be a bug, which might be removed with the last update.<BR><BR>
Because I don't have the possibility to test Napalm in a network, this is my summons: Did anyone also
have problems with Napalm? Or can you help Manni Froitzheim? Please write directly to him or to me,
I will forward it, then.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
