	One of the most important tasks was the design of the memory interface. Its speed is currently derived from a bus
	clock of 66MHz. The actual bandwidth may be higher or lower according to the actual board clock.<P>
	
	The bus interface is designed to provide a bus bandwidth of 427 MB/s. This can be achieved for cachable (memory)
	accesses. Non-cachable accesses are performed as single accesses and reduce the bandwidth to 267 MB/s during transfer.
	The memory bandwidth can decrease to 217 MB/s (88 MB/s non-cachable), but this should only occur during blocking.
	However PPC address arbitration has a minimum duration of 3 cycles. Thus one-precessor-memory-only-single-accesses
	can deliver only a maximum data rate of 178 MB/s. Remember that little difference between bandwidth and data rate.
	This is not relevant for bursts, since they have a length of five cycles, transferring 32 Bytes.<P>
	
	Since the data rate requested by the PPC is normally lower than the provided bandwidth, there is idle time left
	on the bus allowing to intermix accesses of a second processor or the DMA-Controller. This depends heavily upon
	the application. Tasks only moving data around consume more bandwidth than for example ray tracers. <P>
	
	This high bandwidth is achieved by implementing an extensively used address-pipeline. The PPC supports a separate
	arbitration of the address and data bus, so that (memory) cycles requiring latency don't occupy the busses through
	waitstates. Transfer requests are stored in the address pipeline and a command microcode is generated. Only if
	the data bus was idle the address pipeline is bypassed and the request forwarded directly to the following circuitry.<P>
	
	SDRAMs can provide a maximum bandwidth of 533 MB/s, but since they are DRAMS internally, they need some time to
	present/accept data. The cycles needed for this is called latency. In order not to occupy the data bus until a
	command completes, the data bus prediction unit pre-calculates this latency with the information gathered from
	the microcode, thus predicting when the data bus will become idle. The (four) memory controller schedules the memory
	commands according to this information. This board provides four memory banks (two DIMM slots), so blocking should
	not appear too often.<P>

	The PowerPC board directly resides on the Zorro bus. This grants a fast connection to graphic cards and SCSI-controllers
	on this bus without having to pass the (Fat/&quot;Super&quot;-) Buster bottleneck. So the bandwidth is determined
	by the Zorro backplane and the participating devices only. This board only supports Zorro-III protocol since only
	this provides an accurate speed using DMA and burst mode. Zorro-II shows it's big limitation especially when tranferring
	graphic data. This is surely not the last word about Zorro-II, but there's nothing more to say for now. <P>
	
	There is no way to support EDO or FPM DRAMs any more. At first it would destroy all advantages of the pipelining
	concept, on the other hand the DIMMs necessary for the SDRAM are not previously used by any Amiga, so that no large-capacity
	EDO-DIMM should be wasted.<P>

    Originally the design consisted of a central controller chip, which managed 
	the CPU and memory control on one side and on the other it had a direct ZorroIII
	 interface.<P>
	 
	The specifications on CPU/memory side did not change. On the interface side the 
	Zorro interface has been exchanged by a full-featured PCI Master/Slave(Target) 
	interface.<P>
	
	So this device is comparable to a 'North Bridge' of a PC chip set, of course with
	respect to the PowerPC/Amiga environment.<P>
	
	The Zorro interface now resides on an additional device, the PCI-Zorro Bridge. This 
	interface also can operate in Master and Slave modes.<P>
	
	Since PCI is a low latency bus, this architecture does not incur
	significant performance decreases (compared to direct ZorroIII interface). This is 
	being supported by on-chip buffers.<P>

    Thus the bandwidth on the 32-bit, 33MHz PCI bus is estimated to reach 96 MB/s.<P>

<FONT SIZE="2"  FACE="Arial, Helvetica">

This quite basical change now offers two substantial advantages.<P>

First, using a connector, it is now possible to attach a card with off-the-shelf
PCI devices. Such devices feature for example SCSI, graphics and USB.<P>

On a board being seated in a Zorro Slot, 'real' PCI slots cannot be provided due
to mechanical reasons. But since it will only one connector it should be possible to
mount more than one device onto one card. Which parts should be chosen
for this will still remain to be decided.<P>

Second, the additional chip (the PCI-Zorro bridge) now offers the pin resources 
that missed before when considering a ZorroII implementation. Through the 
PCI interface that has been described above it will even make more sense to
run a processor card in a ZorroII slot as before.<P>

By this, it should get feasible to run the Brainstormer card within an A2000. But due to the 
wide variety of A2000 accelerator boards it can not be estimated by now if compatibility issues
(especially on DMA Transfers) can lead to occasional limitations.«<P>
