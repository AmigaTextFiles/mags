Hi!
</P>
<P>
This is the new edition of your AMIGA aktuell games section! As there weren't
many news this month, so is the size of the section 'Games news from all over
the world'. But there are some demo versions, which have been published, but
all of them, except 'Tales from Heaven' and 'Virtual GP' look like PD games...:-(
</P>
<P>
Most things changed in the emulator szene, e.g. WarpSNES offers sound, now.
</P>
<P>
Else there is is a little discussion about the theme Napalm test by
Manni Froitzheim. I could not avoid an own comment, because there were
some claims, which I think were not O.K. Please watch the desired section.
Comments regarding this or different themes are welcome.
</P>
<P>
This month I wondered about the announcements of Islona Entertainment,
to publish the game Superfrog again. Without any doubt, Superfrog is a
nice jump'n'run game, but are there really people who want to buy a game,
which is 6 years old, now? I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
Another headline this month was, that Settlers II might not come. Unfortunately
I have no latest news regarding this theme. But I hope, to get an interview
with Titan Computer for the next edition. Else I can only say: Write to
Blue Byte &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hotline@bluebyte.de">hotline@bluebyte.de</A>&gt;, if
you would like Settlers II for the Amiga!
</P>
<P>
There is no review with this edition, but you should wait for the next edition,
because there are many games, which are announced for April/May. The 'New PD-games
in Aminet' section is also quite small this month, because the Aminet failed
for various weeks and I don't have an overview, what was really new.
</P>
<P>
Well, then have fun with this edition!
</P>
