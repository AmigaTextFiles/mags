<H2>8. Comment regarding the Napalm test by Manni Froitzheim (by Aicke Schulz)</H2>
<P>
To anticipate one thing: this preview says exactly what I feel. It was written
by a real strategy game fan without any prejudice. A real plus point! =)
</P>
<P>
Those of you, who think this beginning like talking like a book, I say it
with different words: I really like this preview and hadn't made it better.
Any questions, that interested me were answered and the evaluation was
in my opinion really fair.
</P>
<P>
If I hadn't read this report I would not have known that there is no direct
2 player mode and it is most like I had bought it.
</P>
<P>
I would like to avoid it, but I have to say, that any other test reports,
no matter where (and I read at least 4 others), they didn't justice to
this game, sorry.
</P>
<P>
I downloaded the dem. And I heard that the sound effects are good (I cannot
evaluate, if it's CD sound, but I think it is as good as Foundation) and
I noticed that the graphics are fine in a high  resolution (in low resolution it is
nearly unplayable), I agree with all testers in this matter. But that the
lots of disadvantages were generously ignored, but from Manni F., is very
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
And this is supposed to be &quot;The best game for the Amiga&quot; (read in
this way or similar multiple times)? Not for me.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga software companies don't make it easy for me:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> I thought Foundation will become THE top hit ... I think, it's unplayable
</LI>
<BR><LI> and now Napalm, brilliant graphics (if I would put a graphics board
  into my computer, it would be worth it), fine sound, but the rest? 2-player-mode
  just using the Internet or networ, I get sick, if I think of 1. a telephone
  bill, which is not of this world or 2. the hopeless search to find another
  Amiga fan with a good Amiga, interest in Napalm AND (a quite cheap) network
  card in Berlin ... a nearly unsolveable venture.
  It's a pity, Napalm, I'm sorry ClickBOOM ... I don't spend my money that
  easy, just because there was a lack of games for a long time.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Maybe you might think .. Oh, god, another pessimist, I can't hear it again,
it's going up ....
</P>
<P>
It's not that easy ... I didn't inveest into my Amiga for nothing (tower,
CD-ROM, PPC board ...) during the last years or programmed for it (as co-author of &quot;Madhouse&quot;),
but got nearly no return favour ...
</P>
<P>
How I can hold me back from jumping out of a window?
I wait for games like &quot;The Settlers II&quot;, WipOut, Fusion and PCx for
PPC and some other games, which were announced, but I doubt their completion ...
</P>
<P>
Once and for all, I don't spend money for games with the standard of PD games,
I invested too much into my hardware and my positive believe to &quot;punish&quot;
myself with games like Gunbee F99 ... not even, if it was freeware, but it's
not the fault of the programmer.
</P>
<P>
The motivation of some persons to port &quot;super-fine-games-like-there-are-for-the-PC&quot,
with just a handfull of people (and less) is laudable, but unrealistic. It's better
if you join and do less, but better games, and if possible not the 300. Amiga-3D shooter =)...
</P>
<P>
Without Napalm there is nothing for me to do but to raise the numberless hours of
playing &quot;Settlers 1&quot; or to play &quot;Settlers III&quot; in a PC-network
thanks to a friend.
</P>
<P>
Just a little comment regarding Settlers 3 for all the other Settler fanatics =) :
</P>
<P>
Super fine graphics (+), fine sound (+), but a hard control (-) and missing
statistics (--), so it is an apple with maggots ... but it is a tasty apple
after all =)
</P>
<P>
*At the end here is a TIP for Napalm:*
If you should have the problem, you created a building and want to place it
somewhere, but you have to move a soldier or a vehicle ... just press the
right mouse button, this interrupted the build option and I was able to move
the unit and to place the building without creating it again!
But I only own the demo version, maybe this doesn't work with the full version!?
