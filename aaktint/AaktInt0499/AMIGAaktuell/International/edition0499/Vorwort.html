<P>
Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell.
</P>
<P>
March was as gripping as February ended. This may or may not be due to
the new AMIGA boss Jim Collas: Within a few days there were happening so
many interesting things, which weren't at Amiga (resp. the predecessors)
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The mostly boring and depressing months of the last time seem to be over...
</P>
<P>
Also phase 5, which was expected to be in leaving the AMIGA by many people,
reported back and announced a PowerPC-G3/G4 board - if there are at least
1000 advanced bookings. But if this will happen for a board which is approx.
2000 DEM (approx. 1020 Euros) is at least doubtful.
</P>
<P>
In March a new Amiga hardware manufacturer came up: The German company Metabox,
formerly founded as Pios, which wasn't present on the Amiga market before,
announced PowerPC-G3-boards for the Amiga models A1200, 2000, 3000 and 4000.
</P>
<P>
Last month there was another important event, but as since in the last years
without AMIGA (and so without a report in AMIGA aktuell international): The
worlds largest computer show CeBIT. Presently it seems that will change next
year - at least, if AMIGA can show a working model of the Next Generation Amiga.
Because in this case the company has no chance avoiding this show - and AMIGA aktuell
international as online magazine, either...

<LI> We are looking for someone, who wants to do his/her own AMIGA aktuell international
column, that informs about software updates. Each month there are new
revisions for countless FD and commercial AMIGA programs. This new column
should list the most important improvements of new software updates.<BR>
Who is interested in, to do that?
</LI>
<LI> We are still looking for testers of freely distributable software.
Everybody who wants to do this job is filled into a special distribution
list, and gets ideas for tests in unregular intervals. You aren' obliged
to perform the tests.
<P>
  Of course, we are happy about tests of commercial products as well.
