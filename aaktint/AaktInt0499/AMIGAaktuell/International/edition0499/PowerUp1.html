<H2>1. phase 5 digital products introduces the Cyberstorm G3/G4 Project</H2>
<P>
</P>
				<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">»Oberursel
March 19
1999:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Once again phase 5 digital products is happy to announce a groundbreaking
				new development
which will represent an extract of phase 5's
				leading-edge technologies and the many years of expertise in designing
				upgrade products for Amiga computers. After a long time of evaluating
				the market
we have decided to support the existing Amiga user
				base and the new developments at Amiga Inc. with a next generation
				product
which will offer highest performance
future compatibility
				and a bridge to industry standards. This product will be a powerful
				PPC accelerator for A3000/A4000 systems (and other Amiga systems
				expanded with an A4000 compatible CPU slot) and the upcoming Amiga
				OS 3.5
as well as future versions of the Amiga OS.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The new accelerator
the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> board
is a pure PowerPC-based processor card. It will ship with
				a fast PowerPC750 or PowerPC7400 (G4 with Altivec)
which is installed
				in a ZIF socket. This ZIF socket is fully compliant with the Interposer
				standard from IBM and Motorola
which is also used in PowerMacs
				and other systems
what will allow easy upgrading
if required
				by the user in the future. In the base version with a 400MHz PowerPC750
				processor and 1MB backside Cache @ 200MHz
the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> will provide an impressing peak performance of up to 19.2 SPECint95
				and 13.1 SPECfp95 (source: IBM website 03/18/99). In real-world
				applications
this allows incredible application performance
				which is estimated to reach 15 -20 times the performance of a
				50MHz 68060 processor (with native PowerPC coded or PowerPC optimized
				applications). The <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> will use standard SDRAM running at 100MHz
providing a peak memory
				transfer rate of 582 MB/s
and has two DIMM sockets which will
				support up to 1 GB main memory. An on-board PCI 2.1 interface
				will allow the connection of all kind of industry standard devices
				and cards. The on-board Flash ROM with 512kB size can be used
				to install software necessary for system-startup and other functionalities.
				By default
this Flash ROM will only contain a basic boot-strap
				functionality (hardware write protected) which will allow to install
				any kind of system software from disks; this functionality will
				be fully documented and freely available to everybody.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">By it's design concept
the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> is the perfect solution for running native PowerPC coded Operating
				Systems as well as emulated 68k OS segments. As a processor card
				which fits into the A4000 compatible fast slot
it allows to run
				100% native PowerPC code
and has full access to all system hardware
				functionalities and interrupts which is not the case with add-ons
				that are not installed in the fast slot
but e.g. in a Zorro slot.
				With it's ability to be the master system CPU
the PowerPC on
				the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> does not need an additional 68k processor which is the case in
				other designs. Beside the technical advantages of this approach
				it offers the user the opportunity to e.g sell an existing 68060
				processor card in the second-hand market
thus lowering the cost
				of the upgrade to the PowerPC G3/G4 generation.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">phase 5 digital products will NOT built or deliver any software
				or hardware add-ons for the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B>. The <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> will be open to third party developers in a wide way:</FONT></P>
				<UL>
					<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Software support will be realized with the new developments from
					Amiga Inc. and Haage&amp;Partner
especially with the upcoming Amiga
					OS3.5 with PowerPC support
and upcoming 68k emulator products.
					Additionally
the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> is perfectly suited for the implementation of other Operating
					Systems such as Linux
which have already been realized on earlier
					PowerUp boards. <BR>
					<BR>
					</FONT>
					<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">For hardware add-ons
the implemented PCI 2.1 interface will allow
					third-party vendors to design PCI bus backplanes
and write drivers
					for any common PCI card on the market. The interface is implemented
					as a single connector
to which other vendors can connects e.g.
					PCI cards or PCI backplanes
or design a physical link to PCI
					slots on bus expansion boards. </FONT>
				</UL>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">However
due to the current market status
we can only justify
				the realization of this project with a significant number of preorders.
				We will therefore have to collect a total of 1
000 orders from
				customers (end users
dealers
or distributors). For each of these
				orders
we will also ask for a down-payment of DM 250
which will
				be collected on a notary account and will only be made available
				to us at the time we deliver the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> product to the customers. This gives security to all customers
				who want to support this exiting new project and get stunning
				G3/G4 performance for their Amiga
and will give security to us
				when we make the necessary investments. </FONT></P>
				<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">What will be the cost of this product
and are benefits there
				benefits for preordering?</FONT></B></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The regular list price for the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B>
including </FONT></P>

995 plus local taxes (in Germany: DM 2.299
- incl.
				MwSt). This price is based on the current price projections for
				components and parts for the 3rd quarter 1999
and will be updated
				whenever major components such as the CPUs fall in price.</FONT> </P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A price for a <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> model with the new XPC7400 (G4 with Altivec) processor is not
				yet determined
and will depend on the pricing of these new processors.
				As soon as we have these pricings
we will determine a list price
				for this product. </FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For those Amigans who are ready to support this major technological
				step forward by placing one of the necessary preorders
we offer
				a special benefit: Customers who are ready to order this board
				in advance
at the conditions mentioned herein
will get this
				stunning product for a special discounted preorder price of DM
				1
750 plus local taxes
including world-wide free delivery by
				economy postal service. And even more: If the regular list price
				drops before the preordered <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> boards start to ship
the discounted preorder price will be reduced
				by the same amount.</FONT></P>
				<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">How will the whole project proceed
and be finalized?</FONT></B></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">First of all
we will now be looking forward to the response of
				the Amiga community to this project. The basic concepts of the
				<B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B>
as well as major parts of the design (such as the SDRAM controller
				and the PCI bridge) have been developed at phase 5 digital products
				during the past year
as building blocks of other projects that
				we are working on; in other words
most of the product is already
				&quot;in the drawer&quot;. From the day we can make the decision to start
				the project finalization
we estimate roughly four months until
				the product can be shipped to the customers. Therefore
the shipping
				date will largely depend on the time which we need to collect
				the preorders. </FONT></P>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The project has four stages:</FONT></P>
				<OL>
					<LI><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Announcement and preorder phase. <BR>
					</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
					We now collect preorders from customers all over the world. Please
					only place a preorder - which is not yet legally binding - if
					you are really ready to buy the CYBERSTORM G3/G4
and if you are
					ready to later pay the prepayment. If many users place preorders
					now
but then cancel or refuse to prepay
this will hurt the project
					flow significantly. If you are not definitely interested in this
					stunning new technology
please don't place an order.<BR>
					<BR>
					</FONT>
					<LI><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Notification phase. <BR>
					</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
					Once we have received the necessary 1
000 preorders - the sooner
					the better
of course - we will open the notary account
and send
					notifications to all customers which will include a proforma invoice
					and the terms of the contract
as well as information about the
					usage of the prepayments. At the same time
we will also release
					updated product information and updated pricing
if available.
					All customers will be asked to pay the prepayment with 3 weeks
					to the notary account.<BR>
					<BR>
					<I>Important</I>: The prepaid amounts will not become available to phase 5 digital
					products before we actually ship the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> boards to the customers who have ordered. If we fail to deliver
					the product within a certain time from date of notification
the
					prepaid money will be reimbursed. The prepaid money will not be
					reimbursed if the customer cancels his order for any reason. <BR>
					<BR>
					</FONT>
					<LI><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Development phase</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
					Design finalization and vericification
including rapid prototyping
					and full in-system test will require appx. 3 months. During this
					time
we will also work in close contact with other developers
					and support software development on the new boards.<BR>
					<BR>
					</FONT>
					<LI><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Release &amp; Shipment<BR>
					<BR>
					</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">Once the <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> is released for production
we will go into the assembly
and
					start to fullfill the preorders. The first boards will ship appx.
					4 weeks after the start of the production. We will fullfill the
					preorders in the order we have received them. After the preorders
					are fullfilled
we will decide if we continue to built <B>CYBERSTORM G3/G4</B> boards for the regular market
what will depend on the market
					situation and the demand forecasts at this time.</FONT>
				</OL>
				<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you want to take part in this stunning new development for
				the AMIGA
which finally will bring the latest G3/G4 technology
				to the AMIGA and support the new developments by AMIGA Inc. and
				their partners
then go ahead and
