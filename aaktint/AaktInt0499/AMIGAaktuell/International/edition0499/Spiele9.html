<H2>9. Comment regarding the Napalm test by Manni Froitzheim (by Andreas Falkenhahn)</H2>
<P>
Well, now I have to give a comment to the controversial Napalm test report by Manni Froitzheim
(s. <A HREF="../edition0399/Spiele8.html">AMIGA aktuell internation 3/99</A>) and best in short list:
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">1)&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Most criticism was about,
that Napalm could also be played in 2-player-mode via network.This is really a big drawback,but an update for 2 players in under
development ans so someone should be happy, if a game is under active developement instead of making money and to
rest. There are not many games, which have updates after the release. I think this allone is a plus point.
The developer team wants feedback to improve Napalm!&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">2)&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">To call Napalm a &quot;(...) cheek and the height of impudence(...)&quot;
is in my opion exeggerated. How do you want to call games like Gunbee F-99, Imperator etc. as well as to rate them (0.5%?).
I know well enough that 80% of the games, that are published are on PD level. Now watch Napalm, don't you notice, that this
is the work of professionals? And that is was created with love to detail?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">3)&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">The exiting in network mode, which was criticized, is likely to be a bug,
which could be removed without greater problems (and is most likely to be removed, except no one reported it.)&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">4)&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">I dont support that opionon, that Napalm was the best game for the Amiga.
That is an exeggerated rating.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
So, there's something I have to make clear:
</P>
<P>
I don't want you to believe &quot;he just wants to vouch for bad games&quot;
or something similar. If a game is bad, it is evaluated that way. But
Napalm is a good Command&amp;Conquer clone and they took great trouble
and the game is under active further development.
</P>
<P>
So, that's my opinion regarding this theme! Normally I wouldn't say something
about that, but the kind of making Napalm bad, was really not fair!
