<H2>5. Hardware test: 'Highscreen quadruple-Auto-Data-Switch' (by Axel Teichmann)</H2><BR><BR>
<B>Notice of the translator: 'Highscreen' is a brand of a German company and I doubt, if it
can be bought in other countries than Germany (Austria and Switzerland, maybe). Please inform me,
if I should drop tests of those kind.</B><BR><BR>

<B>Installation:</B>
<P>
 The device is connected to with 25-pin-cables to each of the up to 4 computers.
 Exiting of the automatic switch you have to connect the printer. That's it. The
 device doesn't need any external power supply.
</P>
<P>
 Inverted the switch can be used as a port multiplier, so you can use 4 printers
 with 1 computer, but you need an extra software for the switching.
</P>
<B>Design:</B>
<P>
 The device appears quite compact and professional. The case is just big enough
 for the interfaces and switches.
</P>
<P>
 Includes is a PC-DOS formatted disk, which contains the software for DOS and
 Windows to use the switch in the mode 1 computer / 4 printers. On disk there
 is the source code in C and Clipper to port it to other sytems.

</P>
<B>Manual:</B>
<P>
 The manual is limited to one DIN-A4 page (approx. US-Letter format), which
 includes the warranty informations, the installation instructions and the
 switch connections.
</P>
<B>Practical hardware test:</B>
<P>
 Connecting the cables brought the least problems. Switching multiple computers
 to one printer (Amiga, PC, Laptop) to on printer is functional and done
 very good. There are no complaints. The device works fine, as its
 &quot;cheaper&quot; collegues for less than 30/40 DEM (approx. 15.31/20.41
 Euros). The manual mode worked without problems, too.
</P>
<P>
 The other mode &quot;1 computer / 4 printers&quot; that makes this switch interesting
 needs the use of a software, which transmits some &quot;control sequences&quot;,
 that allows the switch to select the correct port, before executing the print job.
 Unfortunately there is no software for the Amiga, so I first tested this function on
 a PC. The includes software is more functional than nice. After sending the switch to
 the &quot;Printman&quot; programmer Stephan Rupprecht, he developped a control software
 for it, which works fine with this switch, a short time after that.
</P>
<P>
<B>(Practical software test:)</B>
</P>
<P>
 In the moment the software is just one program, which handles all functions
 fine. The manual is in English only, but easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
 The software  can be used via parameters in the CLI to allow other programs
 a switching or to use it with a little user interface from the WB, where you
 can give each button an on name.
</P>
<P>
 The software supports IOBlix, Multiface 3 and with a small modifications
 of the hardware the internal parallel port of the Amiga. The software
 works fine with printer spoolers &agrave; la &quot;Printman&quot;.
</P>
<P>
 The program is shareware (5 DEM, approx. 2.55 Euros) and runs completely.
 According to Stephan Rupprecht an integration as device is also planned to
 get use of it using Turboprint.
</P>
<P>
 The software for the switch box can be evaluated as well done and very
 flexible, because there aren't any alternatives.
</P>
<B>Positive:</B>
<P>
 Very good quality and function. Possibility to extend to parallel port
 up to 4 interfaces without re-plugging.
</P>
<P>
 Software solution in the Aminet for the Amiga is of better quality than
 for the PC.
</P>
<B>Negative:</B>
<P>
 Quite expensive. Unfortunately no software for the Amiga included. Quite
 short manual.
</P>
<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
 Since there is a software for this interface multiplier the device can be
 strongly recommended. Who doesn't need the functions of the 4 selectable
 interfaces, but just wants to share one printer to multiple computers is
 better served with cheaper devices, because you have to switch off the
 bi-directional data transfer, as well as with PCs.
