<H2>6.Preview: Tales of the Heaven</H2>
Since a short time you can marvel at the demo of the Super Mario 3D clone<BR>
Tales of the Heaven. This game is a kind of 3D jump'n'run. The game was<BR>
prgorammed 100% in assembler and runs playable, but not smooth, on my 68040.<BR>
But this is understandable, if you watch the computed environment. The<BR>
controls are very individual, but after some time you get use to them.<BR>
Unfortunately the demo version quits, if you fall e.g. from the stairs.<BR>
You find yourself on the Workbench, again. But if the game is slightly improved,<BR>
it could become a hit, without doubt. Tales of the Heaven is THE Amiga game<BR>
of the 3D jump'n'run genre. Presently it supports only AGA, but a RTG support<BR>
is under development. It will not support PowerPC, because it was programmed<BR>
completely in Assember. Lets hope, there are some optimizations regarding<BR>
speed and controls. The demo can be downloaded e.g. from the Amiga Flame<BR>
website. You absolutely should watch it. Nothing has been said about the<BR>
release date of the full version, there has to be found a distributor, first.<BR>
