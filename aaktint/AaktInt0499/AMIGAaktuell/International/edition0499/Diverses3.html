<P>
Please contact Heinrich Angler or Andreas Kuessner before making your order, because the operator has to be
released by Macrosystems!
</P>
<P>
Dealers can get the operator together with the update directly from Oberland Computer:

</P>
<B>Usage:</B>
<P>
The operator is quite easy to use. First you have to start Wildfire - there is no further knowledge of the user
regarding Wildfire 7 required. In Wildfire there aren't any settings to be made, everything works completely automatically!
</P>
<P>
You can draw the WF operator on the time line of a UPN interface of Movieshop as any Movieshop operator.
</P>
<P>
A window opens, where you can set the editing mode, the effect group and the desired effect using list gadgets.
</P>
<P>
The operator shows instead of the effect name the name of the group and the Wildfire effect within the cut list.
On the right and on the left near the operator icon you find the operator name WfMS. Within the status line the current
computing step is shown, if the operator window stays open.
</P>
<P>
The three included MovieShop macros WFControl, WFHide and WFShow make it possible to iconify resp. to activate the
Wildfire window out of MovieShop.
</P>
<P>
WFControl iconifies resp. activates the window depending from the current status of Wildfire. WFHide iconifies the window
and WFShow activates the window.
</P>
<P>
Some powerful special effect scripts will be made available, when buying the operator, for free. Oberland Computer will
continue selling various effect collections for each 50 DEM - 100 DEM (approx. 25.51 - 51.02 Euros) or bundled with Wildfire 7
for approx. 500 DEM (approx. 255.10 Euros).
</P>
<P>
The user can create his own effect sessions in Wildfire and use them out of Movieshop, of course. Of course, experience is necessary,
to do this.
</P>
<P>
Due to the simple concept of WF the chreation of these scripts is nearly a children's play.
</P>
<P>
Movieshop and Wildfire run on a normal Amiga as well as on a Draco.

<P>
Some effects require some time to be computed. During this time it seems, that nothing works, but your computer works quite
intensive, anyway.
</P>
<P>
During the calculation of a picture by Wildfire the operation cannot be aborted. So be patient - it's worth it !!
