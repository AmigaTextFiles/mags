<H2>1. Test: Amiga emulator 'Amiga Forever Online-Edition' (by Maik Mettner)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;<B>Preface</B>
</P>
<P>
For all of you who don't know what Amiga Forever is: It is an emulator, that
as the name says, emulates (replicates) our Amiga computer on a PC.
</P>
<P>
<B>Installation</B>
</P>
<P>
In the test version I have the Amiga Forever Online Edition is an EXE file
with a size of approx. 6.5 MB, which unarchives all program parts and starts
the installation assistant, which guides you through the really easy installation.
</P>
<P>
During the installation you actually have to set the installation path and
decide, if you want the Amiga Explorer to be installed.
</P>
<P>
<B>Program start</B>
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/AmigaForever.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AmigaForever.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
After all necessary files have been installed and rebooted the computer
you can start Amiga Forever
</P>
<P>
This is done in a really easy way by entering the Start menu of Windows and
start the LAUNCHER, that is in the meny entry - Programme - Cloanto - Amiga Forever.
If you started it a comfortable menu box opens, whee you can start the
already configured emulations from Amiga OS 1.3 to OS 3.0 or enter the
configuration menu of WinUAE (remark: this Online edition of Cloanto only
contains the Windows version of UAE, but you can download others e.g. DosUAE
for free, later) or read the Documentation.
</P>
<P>
In the detailed configuration menu you can change all important settings
per mouse click to adjust the emulation to the present PC system.
</P>
<P>
So you can set the size of Fast-RAM and CHIP-RAM the emulated Amiga should have,
the Kickstart 1.3 or 3.0 (are already included as ROM images), emulate
sound or not, the type of display of the emulation - in the window or as
full screen -, input-/output devices, and so on. You really should try
many configs to adjust the emulation to the equiptment of the PC.
</P>
<P>
As an experienced Amiga user you shouldn't have any problems with the configuration
proggi (remark: You should give the emulation Z3 memory to avoid the computing intensive
chunky-to-planar-conversion for the Amiga graphic display.)
</P>
<P>
<B>Speed</B>
</P>
<P>
Well, I tested the A-Forever on two systems:
1. P90, 2MB graphics board, 16 MB RAM, Win 95 - this system is to recommend
only to people, who like raytracing on an A500. That means that it is possible to
run the emulator, but it is very, very slow.
</P>
<P>
2.PII 350MHz, 16MB graphics board, 64MB, Win 98 - on this system I got a real
Amiga feeling and I have to say, I had the feeling to work with my A1200/040.
</P>
<P>
<B>Program package</B>
</P>
<P>
The online edition I tested contained some useful progs, e.g. Personal Paint 7.1
(also from Cloanto), Tool manager, Picasso 96 as graphics driver system, AmiToRTF,
DirDiff, the copmlete Amiga OS files and the AExplorer.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the AExplorer I have to say, that it (should?!) do data transfers
via serial null modem cable or TCP stack between the Amiga and the PC.
Unfortunatey I couldn't get it to transfer data in this in my test, even if
PC2AM works fine with the serial port.
</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>
The Amiga-Forever-Online-Edition can be recommended to everyone, who has to
work with a PC, but doesn't want to miss his Amiga.
</P>
<P>
I hope, this test helped all of you a little bit and please overlook my
mistakes, because this was my first test.
