<H2>2. Progress report: Eagle Computer (by Bert Sommer)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;I read your article regarding Eagle. The behaviour of the company
Eagle isn't surprising from my point of view. In the contrary, it fits
into the image, I had to make about the company Eagle.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996 I ordered a Space-Tower for my Amiga 1200 from Eagle. To
save the costs for post and package I paid in advance (a mistake!). When
I wanted to get the parcel from the post office, I had to pay the complete
bill again (incl. the costs for post and package). &quot;Just&quot; a month
later I got my money back as a cheque. But that isn't all. The consignment
was the tower case and various small parts. But no manual! A real 3D puzzle.
So I called Eagle again, which sent 3 pages per Fax. So initiative of one's
own and fun solving a puzzle is what is asked for. Then I found out, that
some parts were missing, but some other parts without use were included.
Anyway, it was a real 3D puzzle. That was enough for me and I swore: no more
Eagle. Meanwhile I swapped to a Micronic tower and an Amiga 3000.
