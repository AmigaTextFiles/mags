Let's go!

This exclamation was heard more than once, e.g. when Escom bought the remaining
parts of Amiga in 1995, or when Gateway (2000) did the same, two years later.
But I never found that many enthusiastic Amiga users as presently. I read
various reports of users, which had the chance to meet Amiga president Jim
Collas on the Amiga 99. They were convinced of his plans and more important,
they are also convinced, that they can be realised. Such an advance of trust
for a new man at the head I hadn't watched in the last years. Also the standing
ovations of the visitors of the show after Jim Collas' speech speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
In the margin of the show there was a meeting of the representatives of the
American user groups and AMIGA, represented by Jim Collas, Jim VonHolle, Jeff
Schindler, Bill McEwen and Darreck Lisle. In this meeting they agreed upon
essential improvements, the communication between AMIGA and the users, especially
the user groups.
</P>
<P>
Presently AMIGA is moving to San Diego. After that it will become clear, if
the company will hold its agreements. A participant of tihs meeting said,
that he has had the feeling to be considered seriously and to have an ear
for ideas, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Many people think this is the last chance to make the Amiga survive and as it
seems Gateway and AMIGA try everything to take this chance.
</P>
<P>
Who knows, maybe February 1999 will become the month in the history of our
computer system, in which the rescuer of the Amiga came... We just can hope so.

Happy easter holidays!
