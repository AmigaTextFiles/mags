The authors of Battle Duel decided to give the project to interested
Amiga users. But the old BattleDuel team decides, who belongs to the
new team. Applications have to be sent to <A HREF="mailto:battleduel@gmx.net">battleduel@gmx.net</A>.

A port of the first ID Software 3D shooter Wolfenstein (which is indexed by

<P>
Shortly after the publication of Napalm there is the first update.
There are some of the improvements: Napalm runs more stable and many
bugs were removed, it's better to play and there are some graphic
improvements. The update can be downloaded from the clickBOOM homepage.

It seems that this month was the month of demos: There were released
Phoenix Fighters, Tales from Heaven and The prophet. You can read previews
regarding Phoenix Fighters and The Prophet. Tales from Heaven was already
introduced in the edition of December. (Remark of the translator:
Due to the fact that the December edition was not translated the test is
included in <B>this edition</B>, too.)

<LI> Looflirpa Entertainment releases Tomb Raider II
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
After Tomb Raider III was published for the PC Looflirpa got cheap the
rights for part II of the top game. They worked since late January
and was nearly ready. In the port team there are mostly programmers from
the demo szene, which rewrote the complete code for texture mapping
as well as mipmapping. Instead of the Standard OpenGL implementation
cumstom routines were use to get everything out of the 68k processors.
According to their informations the Tomb Raider II port runs on an 68040
with 25 MHz and AGA with a resolution of 320x240 with approx. 27 fps.
If a graphics board is present you can use resolutions up to 640x480.
The first version will support only 68k Amigas with AGA or graphics board.
In approx. 2 months there will be a standard port for PowerPCs. An update
for Warp3D is also under development. There are some minor cut backs;
so it is not possible with the Amiga to play Tomb Raider II in a window on
the Workbench. In addition you have to forego for the audio tracks. But
there are top class SoundFX and voice output. Of course, this game is
published on CD-ROM only. Most likely, that there will be a detailed
test in the next edition.

<LI> Update published for the Virtual Grand Prix Demo

</UL>
<P>
The author heard the criticism and made an update for his game
Virtual Grand Prix. Virtual GP is better to play, especially with
the joystick, now.

<LI> Islona Entertainment
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Well, strange things are happening: Islona Entertainment got the rights
to re-publish the game Superfrog. Superfrog was released in 1993 from
Team 17 and wasn't a top hit, but a game of the upper middle class.
Islona wants to distribute Superfrog on CD-ROM and is to run on AGA
Amigas only. If this game ran they want to re-publish more Team 17 games.
But I doubt, that this will be the case, because you can get Superfrog
nearly anywhere for approx. 10 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euros) (CD32/AGA version),
who is going to pay for nearly the same game about 50 DEM (approx. 25.51 Euros)?
In the graphics Superfrog is superior to some games, because the games
released recently have only graphics, that might have been good around 1989.

<P>
The full version of the Super Mario 3D clone 'Tales from Heaven' will be
published in May from Epic Marketing. The end version will have 4 worlds
with 4 levels each. Also graphic boards will be supported.

<LI> Isn't Settlers II to come, now?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
As you might have read in the AMIGA aktuell Special, it is uncertain, if
Settlers II will come. So, write eMails to Blue Byte!
 &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hotline@bluebyte.de">hotline@bluebyte.de</A>&gt;
I hope, I can report about more details in the next edition.
</P>
<P>
-&gt; Titan Computer just confirmed to AMIGA aktuell international, that
the project failed due to Blue Byte. 'The Settlers 2' will not come for
the Amiga.
