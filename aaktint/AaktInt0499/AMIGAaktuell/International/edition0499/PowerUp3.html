<H2>3. Phase 5 with changes, lower prices and A1200-G3/G4 boards</H2>
<P>
</P>

								<p><font face="Arial"><b>»phase 5 digital products </b>is excited to announce that the next step in ground-breaking technological progress will take place soon. Since we first announced the <b>Cyberstorm G3/G4</b> project just 10 days ago
the overwhelming response by the Amiga Community has not only convinced us to extend the original <b>Cyberstorm G3/G4</b> project to an extended Amiga G3/G4 product line. Driven by the excitement of so many Amiga users
we have spent many hours of additional consideration meanwhile
discussing the requests and demands by the user community
and going into technical details and cost optimization. Today we can present </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">some exciting news</font><font face="Arial">
which also make some of the statements of the original announcement and the update obsolete already. </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">However</font><font face="Arial">
if you had not informed yourself about this development before
please read these original announcements which contain information about conditions and time frames for this new product generation.</font> </p>
								<p><font face="Arial">Following the history of world's most established processor upgrade technology for Amiga computers
and implementing the experience of the innovator who made the PowerPC technology for the Amiga a reality
we at phase 5 digital products have also decided to make this new technology available to a much larger user base
and doing what we always did in the past years with our stunning products: Offer more value for less money! And that's what we will be doing again - so go ahead and read about the new additional features at the new lower prices!</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#990000"><b>New models:</b></font><font face="Arial"> By introducing a second product
the <b>Blizzard G3/G4</b>
we will also provide the stunning G3/G4 technology and performance to the users of A1200 Tower systems. Two models - one with G3 and one with G4 processors - can be ordered now. We are also now taking orders for the 300MHz G4 version of the <b>Cyberstorm G3/G4</b>.</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#990000"><b>New features:</b></font><font face="Arial"> All G3/G4 boards from phase 5 digital products come with </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">SCSI on board</font><font face="Arial"> - UltraSCSI on the A1200 versions
UltraWide SCSI on the A3000/A4000 version. Our proven SCSI technology
which has been providing unmatched performance since seven years
will provide full backwards compatibility with existing SCSI devices. But even more than that: With the </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">integration of 400Mbit/s FireWire ports
all our G3/G4 boards</font><font face="Arial"> open the door to this future industry standard
including the world of digital video devices. This opens all Amiga users the access to a fast growing number of peripherals
including also storage and CD/DVD devices
with the comfort of hot-plug-functionality.</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#990000"><b>New prices:</b></font><font face="Arial" color="#990000"> </font><font face="Arial">By proceeding with the related projections and calculations
and going into the details
we have been able to determine new and improved pricings which will make these stunning products even more attractive. Plus
we have changed the pricing to EURO (for Europe) and US$ (for outside Europe).</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#990000"><b>New Order &amp; Prepayment conditions:</b></font><font face="Arial" size="4"> </font><font face="Arial">In order to proceed quickly with the finalization and production of this new product line
we still require the originally announced quantity of back orders with a small prepayment deposit. All </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">customers who support our development by placing a preorder with deposit will receive a major discount</font><font face="Arial"> on the product they select
as announced before (please see below for the new prices and discounts for the different models). But phase 5 digital products is also ready to take </font><font face="Arial" color="#990000">orders without prepayment
</font><font face="Arial"> for the suggested retail prices listed for the different products. These orders will not be shipped by phase 5 digital products directly
but forwarded to local dealers and distributors.</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial">So far the overview of the major changes in the project. Now here comes the list of the extended and updated new G3/G4 product line for the AMIGA by phase 5 digital products. Right now
users can choose out of the following four models:<br>

phase 5 digital products will provide the necessary software tools and drivers
and also cooperate with other developers. Additionally
we are in negotiations about licensing useful software to ship with our G3/G4 boards
and will take care that support of the upcoming AmigaOS developments is realized.</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial"><b>Another note on the prepayment &amp; discount:</b> Remember
the prepayment which enables you to take advantage of the discounted price
will go on a special notary account as announced earlier. The amounts collected there will not become available to us before we actually ship the products; they are a deposit which support our efforts to bring out the new products for the Amiga which the users have been asking for
thus representing a partnership between the Amiga community and us in realizing this stunning new technology for the Amiga.</font></p>
