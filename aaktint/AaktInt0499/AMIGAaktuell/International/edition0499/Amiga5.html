<P>
</P>
»From February 23 - 25, 1999, the third big exhibition for cable TV in India
took place in Calcutta, India. AMIGA International, Inc. attended the exhibition
with an own booth, represented by our distributor Raja Electronics from Delhi.
The show was a complete success for AMIGA.
A lot of people from the cable TV industry came over from nearby Bangladesh
to stock up with A1200's.<br><br>

AMIGA's booth was a one of the most visited booths of the exhibition.
Also, Mrs. Newel from famous German Radio Station "Deutsche Welle",
(another exhibitor) visited AMIGA's booth (picture 3).
AMIGA International, Inc. is now represented in Calcutta by both a dealer
and a service center.<br><br>

During the exhibition (three days), 60 A1200's were sold at the booth and additional
orders have been placed. Employees of several cable TV companies got familiar with 
the AMIGA system using "Scala" during seminars held in Lindbay hotel.
AMIGA is known in India's cable TV industry as one of the most popular and irreplaceable
computer systems.«
