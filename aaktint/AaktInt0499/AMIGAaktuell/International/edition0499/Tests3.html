<H2>3. Software test: Astronomy program 'Digital Almanac' (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Do you know how many stars there are... (remark of the translator:A German folk song)
</P>
<P>
<B>The astronomy program DIGITAL ALMANAC by Achim Stegeman</B>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes an Amiga has to share the attention of its master (or mistress)
with another favorite hobby. And sometimes this hobby is astronomy. If the
hobby astronomist wants to use both - Amiga and astronomy - together, there
aren't many choices.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prgoram DISTANT SUNS by Virtual Reality Laboratories, Inc., which is available
for years and isn't under further development for some time and DIGITAL UNIVERSE by
Syzygy Research & amp; Technology Ltd. a new and since then under further development
program entered the Amiga stage in 1997. The program author named it DIGITAL ALMANAC.

<B>2. Installation</B>
</P>
<P>
The installation is done easily and without problems using the help of
the Installer. Before that you have to download resp. copy the required
files from the Aminet or the Aminet-CDs. When the main program archive
with just 450 KByte can be handled esasily the necessary additional files
with at least 11 MByte cost quite a lot telephone charges. But the patient
user will be rewarded with a letter of the Internet provider ;) and a really
powerful astronomy program.
</P>
<P>
In the DAlmanac_Exe package you will find two installation scripts, which
copy the main program as well as the necessary data files in a drawer on
the hard disk of your Amiga.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/DigitalAlmanac1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigitalAlmanac1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="29" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If Digital Almanac has been installed you should select the flag for a smart
refresh of the windows in the MUI settings. So it is ensured, that Digital
Almanac processes selected menu points. On the other hand you avoid the time
consuming redrawing of the windows, whenever MUI means to replace the content
of the window.
</P>
<P>
<B>3. Program description</B>
</P>
<P>
Before starting the program it might be useful to give some parameters to the
program using the Tool types of the Digital Almanac icon. So you can set the
coordinates of the preferred location or the size of the cache memory to be
used, switch on/off Deep-Sky catalogues, prevent loading of asteroid and
Deep-Sky objects (if you have little RAM), avoid showing the Intro picture,
if your Amiga has no graphics board etc., close the Workbench to save as many
Chip-RAM as possible.
</P>
<P>
After double clicking the program icon the imaginary star heaven is shown on
the screen of the computer monitor. Depending on the hardware requirements
(built-in graphics or graphics board) the display resolution can be used
freely within wide borders.
Digital Almanac is mostly self-explaining. If you ever used other astronomy
software you will understand Digital Almanac quite fast. In addition many
gadgets feature a bubble help and an online and menu help can be used at
any time.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the use of program internal informations Digital Almanac
offers an easy solution to integrate the desired picture based file to
any object, no matter if it's a galaxy, star, planet, asteroid, ...
The integrated pictures can be selected via the menu point &quot;Extras/Bilder&quot;
or with double clicking the desired object and then selecting the desired
object in the popping up window. For displaying the picutres Digital Almanac
uses the Datatypes, the picture.datatype 43.x is supported, too.

</P>
<P>
Since October 1997 I use Digital Almanac in the registered version. During
this period the program author Achim Stegemann answered all the questions,
ideas and wishes with much commitment. An excellent support.
</P>
<P>
Digital Almanac is shareware. For a fee of 30,- DEM (approx. 15.31 Euros)
the user gets a key file, which enables the locked functions. In addition
any further updte can be used as full version with this key file. The
unregistered version has these limitations:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Assess to Deep-Sky catalogues is limited to the Messier catalogue.
</LI>
<BR><LI> All saving functions are disabled.
</LI>
<BR><LI> No hardcopy.
</LI>
<BR><LI> No changing of the location, only Earth.
</LI>
<BR><LI> No detailled run of darkness.
</LI>
<BR><LI> No picture gallery.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Drawing of the stars only up to 6 meters (approx. 6.564 yds).
</LI>
<BR><LI> Drawing of other objects only up to 10 meters (approx. 10.94 yds).
</LI>
<BR><LI> No changing of the pixel size.
</LI>
<BR><LI> No month events in the calendar.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Ephemeride export only in one window.
</LI>
<BR><LI> The program quits after approx. 20 mins and every 5 mins there is
a nerving requester.
</LI>

<B>4. Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>
Digital Almanac is a top class astronomy program. For an unrivalled good
price the program offers an enormous number of functions and power. But
the Amiga should be equipped with the corresponding hardware, to have
really fun when working with Digital Almanac.
</P>
<P>
For any Amiga user having fun with astronomy there can be only one recommendation:
Download it at once! (Or maybe you better wait for 9 p.m. ...)
Digital Almanac is absolutely worth its registration fee.
</P>
<P>
Digital Almanac can be found with its current revision 39.30 e.g. in Aminet
under
