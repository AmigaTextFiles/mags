OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY (07-Apr-99)<BR>
----------------------------------------<BR>
</P><P>
»April 1999<BR>
</P><P>
This is my first open letter to the Amiga community. In many ways, I am<BR>
honored by the opportunity to address such a great community of people and<BR>
represent such a unique brand as Amiga. There are many remarkable Amigans,<BR>
both former and current, that are responsible for Amiga's impressive<BR>
products and its spirit of revolutionary innovation. These are the people<BR>
that created the Amiga phenomena and the people that persevered through<BR>
these tough times. Amiga communities from across the world have kept the<BR>
Amiga spirit alive. I can't claim any responsibility for the early success<BR>
of Amiga or the current endurance. I can only praise the people responsible<BR>
and hope that I can help bring a new era of greatness to Amiga and fulfill<BR>
the hopes of the Amiga community.<BR>
</P><P>
The St. Louis show a few weeks ago was the first Amiga show I attended as<BR>
president of Amiga. From the feedback I have received, the show was a great<BR>
success. The show was well organized with good attendance and was also a<BR>
lot of fun. The number of people who attended was approximately 1,200 but<BR>
more important is the fact that there was a 14% increase in attendance from<BR>
last year. I made my debut as president of Amiga and I want to thank<BR>
everyone who welcomed me to the community. I especially want to thank those<BR>
who welcomed me until 3:00 a.m. in the morning and taught me that Amigans<BR>
really know how to have fun. You know who you are.<BR>
</P><P>
In St. Louis, I had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time<BR>
with people in the Amiga community. Several times during the show, I<BR>
publicly made the statement that the Amiga community is the greatest<BR>
community in the computer industry. I am now more convinced of this than<BR>
ever. The Amiga community is the most innovative, dedicated, heroic and<BR>
enduring community in the computer industry. I am amazed at what the<BR>
community has done with little or no support from a corporate entity. You<BR>
have endured through extremely tough times and kept the spirit of Amiga<BR>
alive and strong.<BR>
</P><P>
Unfortunately, some of the difficulties the Amiga community has endured in<BR>
the last two years stem from some misguided decisions made by Amiga Inc. It<BR>
is now obvious to me that some very big mistakes were made in defining a<BR>
path for Amiga in the last two years. The low priority and support given to<BR>
Amiga by our parent company, Gateway, aggravated this situation. Gateway<BR>
was preoccupied during this period with significant internal restructuring<BR>
to strengthen its core business for the future. The intentions relative to<BR>
Amiga were good but the situation was mismanaged. Some people have told me<BR>
that I should stop talking about past mistakes and only look toward the<BR>
future. I agree with this but I also want people to clearly understand that<BR>
I realize how much our past mistakes have hurt the community and delayed<BR>
progress. This is important because I do not want to repeat these mistakes<BR>
so be patient as I discuss this one last time.<BR>
</P><P>
In my opinion, the biggest mistake was the decision not to evolve the<BR>
current Amiga architecture as we developed the next generation. This hurt<BR>
the current Amiga community the most. The right decision would have been to<BR>
overlap product generations just as Apple did during the Apple II to<BR>
Macintosh transition. Apple evolved the Apple II architecture by<BR>
introducing the Apple III even after Apple came out with the Mac. The Apple<BR>
III wasn't a big seller but it helped Apple II hardware and software<BR>
companies and allowed them time to transition their products to the new Mac<BR>
platform.<BR>
</P><P>
In hindsight and from the vantage of the Amiga community, not evolving the<BR>
current architecture may look like an incredibly stupid mistake but it was<BR>
not as obvious to people coming from the PC industry. I am not trying to<BR>
justify this flawed decision but to give some insight as to how such a<BR>
decision could be made. Living in a computer industry dominated by Wintel<BR>
PCs skewed the thinking of people making this decision. In a computer<BR>
industry dominated by Wintel PCs, computers are obsolete within six to<BR>
twelve months. The inefficiency of the architecture requires a continuous<BR>
upgrading of CPUs, graphics, and storage devices in order to deliver<BR>
acceptable improvements in features and functions. This is what happens in<BR>
an industry where revolutionary innovation has been replaced by constrained<BR>
evolution. From this PC centric view, no one could imagine that a computer<BR>
architecture that stopped evolving in the early '90s could have any life<BR>
left in it. Obviously this view was very limited and flawed as the Amiga<BR>
community has proven over-and-over again how much life was left in the<BR>
current Amiga architecture.<BR>
</P><P>
It is obvious that the community would currently be stronger if we had made<BR>
the decision two years ago to evolve the current Amiga architecture. Two<BR>
years have now passed and we are faced with a tough question. Is there<BR>
still life left in the current architecture? I believe that there is. The<BR>
release of O/S 3.5 in late July or early August will allow the current<BR>
architecture to live on for a few more years. In addition to O/S 3.5 we are<BR>
looking at supporting companies that are looking at hardware enhancements<BR>
to the current architecture. We will also support emulation of the current<BR>
Amiga architecture on the next generation Amiga so that people can use most<BR>
of their old software. I am spending time with key people in the Amiga<BR>
community to finalize transition plans between the current Amiga and the<BR>
next generation.<BR>
</P><P>
Now, it's time to talk about the future! I know this has been an extremely<BR>
difficult and painful period for the Amiga community but I would like to<BR>
put that chapter of the Amiga story behind us and look toward the future.<BR>
We have a difficult road ahead of us with many important decisions to be<BR>
made on our future plans. I will not make the mistake again of not<BR>
understanding the Amiga community, its requirements, and its dynamics. St<BR>
Louis was a good start for me but I require even more input to better<BR>
understand the situation. As all of you know, the Amiga community is very<BR>
strong in Europe with many Amiga companies and extremely impressive<BR>
individuals. I am planning a trip to Germany and the U.K. in late April to<BR>
meet with more leaders in the Amiga community. The objective of my trip is<BR>
partially to communicate our current thinking but mostly to listen and<BR>
understand. I want to understand the opinions of prominent people in the<BR>
Amiga community. I will use this input to finalize our future architecture<BR>
and plans. I especially need help in planning out how we will transition<BR>
from the old architecture to the new architecture in such a way that keeps<BR>
the Amiga community healthy.<BR>
</P><P>
One thing clearly requested by the Amiga community was BETTER COMMUNICATION<BR>
on the activities at Amiga. I promise to improve our communication starting<BR>
with this letter and continuing with frequent postings on our Web site as<BR>
well as increased interaction with the community. Our participation in the<BR>
St. Louis show and my upcoming trip to Germany and the U.K. are good<BR>
examples of our efforts in this area. The letter you are currently reading<BR>
is posted on our Web site in the new "Executive Update" section that I will<BR>
personally be updating on a monthly basis. In this section you will also<BR>
find an update on major activities listed after the monthly letter to the<BR>
community. I think this is a good start and we will continue improving our<BR>
communication as we go forward. If you have any input on my executive<BR>
update web page or on how to improve our communication please send your<BR>
suggestions via email to executive@amiga.com. You can also send email to me<BR>
directly at jim.collas@amiga.com but I get significant amounts of email so<BR>
it may take me a few days to respond. The executive@amiga.com email address<BR>
goes to my assistant who in turn directs the email to the Amiga executive<BR>
that can most effectively reply.<BR>
</P><P>
I know that I have yet to prove my dedication or win your confidence but I<BR>
hope to do so over the coming months. As many of you already know, I<BR>
stepped out of a senior executive position with Gateway that was a very<BR>
prominent position in the PC industry to lead Amiga. I did this because I<BR>
believe strongly in what Amiga stands for. I believe in the Amiga spirit of<BR>
revolutionary innovation. I believe that the PC revolution is over because<BR>
innovative revolution has been replaced by constrained evolution. I believe<BR>
that there is a new computer revolution on the horizon, one that will<BR>
fulfill the promise of bringing the power of computing to the masses. Most<BR>
importantly, I believe that Amiga will play a significant role in this new<BR>
computer revolution. But Amiga can't do this without the full support of<BR>
the Amiga community. The Amiga community is one of the greatest and most<BR>
innovative communities in the computer industry. It is a revolutionary army<BR>
waiting to strike and reclaim its prominent position in the computer<BR>
industry. I truly believe this from the depths of my heart and I promise to<BR>
use all of my experience, resources, industry contacts, and energy to give<BR>
Amiga a strong and aggressive push. I hope I will not let you down.<BR>
</P><P>
Let's keep the momentum going as we come back for the future.<BR>
</P><P>
Sincerely,<BR>
Jim Collas<BR>
President, Amiga«<BR>
