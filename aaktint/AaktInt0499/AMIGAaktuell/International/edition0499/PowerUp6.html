<H2>6. Open letter to phase 5, Met@box and ESCENA</H2>

Andreas Kleinert sent an open letter with an idea to three companies, that announced a G3 resp. G3/G4 board
for the Amiga:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Hallo,
</P>
<P>
Because someone can only use the &quot;case&quot; of the old A3/4000 after mounting a G3/G4 board...
</P>
<P>
I got a different idea:
</P>
<P>
Why not develop a G3/G4 board for x86-PCs?
</P>
<P>
The same has been tried by Siamese with their 68060 board, but I think, it's of more use to save a computer AND
to keep PowerPC support.
</P>
<P>
With an open PCI design with flash-ROM it would be possible to use this board also in a new AmigaNG (if you like
with an option to emulate 68k/PPC under &quot;AmigaSoft 5.0&quot;). The level of compatibility would be equal to the
DraCo resp. an Amiga with CyberGrapX.
</P>
<P>
In detail:
</P>
<P>
After WinUAE/AROS and AmigaNG are close to being available as emulation combination, why not make a PPC board as PCI addon
for the new Amiga available? This could emulate the 68k AND ensure compatibility to PPC applications and Amiga OS 3.5 (3.6,
3.7 ?) and keep work off the new Amiga processor...
</P>
<P>
In addition it could be possible to run WinUAE and the board together on a normal x86-PC.
</P>
<P>
What do you think about it?
</P>
<P>
P.S.: This mail was sent to phase5, Metabox and Escena at the same time.&laquo;
