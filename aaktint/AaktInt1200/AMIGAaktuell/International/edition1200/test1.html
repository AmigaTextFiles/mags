<H1>Test reports</H1>
<H2>1. Little helpers for everyday Amiga usage (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
It is hard to believe, but the year 2000 is already almost over. Every day it gets darker, colder and wetter! Wasn't it the same one year ago? Yes, I think I remember it was. But now it is real fun again to sit here in the cozy warmth and write a few reports from the Amiga utility front. So welcome to the little helpers in the December issue of Amiga Aktuell.
</P>
<P>
First of all thank you for all the nice feedback I got on the last issue. If you are trying to flatter me, I like that!! Keep it coming :). For this issue I picked the programs BlazeWCP, Next 3.0, PowerWindowsNG, HappyEnv and the GUI creator &quot;r&quot; from Aminet.
Feeling comfortable? Candle lit? Cup of tea ready? Let's get going.
</P>
<H3>Next 3.0:</H3>
<P>
Next 3.0 is mainly a display program for all kinds of text and hypertext documents. Compared to the ridiculously small file size of not even 40 KB, the feature list is immense (so there are still assembler programmers ;)).
</P>
<P>
Next 3.0 can display, print and save the following text file formats: ASCII text in DOS, Macintosh and Amiga/UNIX formats, AmigaGuide, HTML, word, write, WordPerfect, RTF, FTXT (text from Clipboard), HLP, man (UNIX help files), Finalwriter/Wordworth documents and finally even exotic files like MacBIN and MacDOC. I hope I have forgotten none!? Files unknown to Next 3.0 can be displayed too, of course, but control characters will be ignored or the text will be displayed unformatted (if it is a text at all).
</P>
<P>
Text documents can be saved as ASCII text or printed. When printing, you can use several format algorithms to achieve a good printout.
</P>
<P>
Files which have been compressed with XPK, LHA, LZX, ZIP, RAR or Powerpacker, or for which a Datatype exists, can be displayed by Next 3.0, too, but for this to work, you will need the appropriate system extensions or decrunchers. To display a file using Datatypes, you first have to activate the DT-Mode. Then you can view all files Multiview can display (including graphics, sounds and animations).
</P>
<P>
Hypertext documents like AmigaGuide or HTML are displayed so that you can follow local hyperlinks with a mouse click as usual. But it doesn't much support gimmickry like inlined graphics, text flow or HTML frames.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Next1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Next1.jpg" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
But the speed Next shows while layouting and displaying such files is really amazing. The HTML document &quot;book-main.html&quot; from the AmigaOS 3.5 CD ROM (in the directory &quot;Manual/dos&quot;, the file size is 1.079.617 bytes) is displayed in less than five seconds (using a 68040/40MHz reading from a 32x-SCSI-CD-ROM drive). The common Amiga web browsers demand more patience from the user.
</P>
<P>
The handling is somewhat unusual. The scroll bar which is used to move through the document is located at the lower end of the window and is used horizontally - not the usual vertically on the left or right side of the window. The cursor keys as well as the number pad are used the usual way (cursor up/down = up/down, 9/3 = page up/down, 7/1 = top/bottom, etc.)
</P>
<P>
Typical Amiga control elements like menus or gadgets are found only very seldom or not at all.
</P>
<P>
Right clicking opens a window where you can select available options from a text list. But this text list is a little unordered.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Next2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Next2.jpg" WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
To make up for that, Next 3.0 requires very little RAM. The program itself only needs about 80 KB of free RAM, and if the document is too big for the free RAM of the computer, it is just loaded as it is displayed.
</P>
<P>
To be able to use the many functions Next 3.0 offers, you should remember the most important hotkeys, and read the extensive documentation, which is available in German and English. Next 3.0 is a program for users who think that function, flexibility and speed are more important than super smooth scrolling and graphical gimmickry.

<H3>BlazeWCP:</H3>
<P>
BlazeWCP is a small patch program that replaces the slow OS functions for C2P conversion (C2P=&quot;chunky to planar&quot;) WriteChunkyPixelLine8() and WritePixelArray8() by faster versions.
</P>
<P>
The new routines are on average twice as fast, and under optimal conditions even more than five times as fast as the original functions of the OS or functions of similar programs. If BlazeWCP is used under AmigaOS 3.1, it also replaces the buggy function WriteChunkyPixels() by a bug free routine. Older patchers like &quot;NewWPA8&quot; or &quot;PatchWPA8&quot; are now superfluous and can or should be removed from the system.
</P>
<P>
Besides the patch itself, the distribution also contains English documentation and the program &quot;wpatest&quot;, which can be used to measure the speed increase. Before starting &quot;wpatest&quot;, you should have read the included README file, because there are some problems, especially with screens that have a resolution lower than 640x480 pixels.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/wpatest.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/wpatest.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="93" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
To use BlazeWCP, you need at least an 68020 processor, free 32-bit Fast RAM and OS 3.0. The AGA chipset is not necessary, but useful. BlazeWCP makes use of the patch collection &quot;FBlit&quot; by Stephen Brookes if it is present. An installer file is not included - to install the patch, copy the file BlazeWCP into the directory &quot;C&quot;: and add an appropriate entry into the file &quot;startup-sequence&quot;. If you have the software &quot;patchcontrol&quot; installed, BlazeWCP should be started after &quot;patchcontrol&quot;. Programs that profit from using BlazeWCP are some AVI- and QuickTime-players, some web browsers, datatypes for graphics, emulators and some other programs. You can find more details in the manual.

<H3>r:</H3>
<P>
No, this is not a typo. That's really the name of the program ;). If you know the program &quot;Argue&quot;, you will have an idea what &quot;r&quot; is trying to do. &quot;r&quot; creates graphical user interfaces for any shell program. Unlike Argue, it doesn't use MUI, but the &quot;ordinary&quot; gadtools.library of the AmigaOS, which in turn means that it doesn't use up a lot of system RAM. There's not much to install. You just have to unpack the program directory somewhere on your hard disk. Then just set a path to the directory, or even better, copy &quot;r&quot; to the &quot;C:&quot; directory.
</P>
<P>
Attention! The distribution contains two different versions in the directory &quot;bin&quot;. One is for OS 2.1 and one for OS 3.0. So you should make sure that you install the correct version. The catalogs directory contains some localizations (deutsch, english, françcais, svenska, norsk). Unfortunately, &quot;r&quot; doesn't work at all if there is no catalog installed. So pay attention to the short well-written German or English AmigaGuide manual, especially the section &quot;installation&quot;.
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. Now that &quot;r&quot; is installed, we could take a look at the GUI of the command &quot;list&quot;. In a shell, enter:
</P>
<PRE>
r list
</PRE>
<P>On OS 3.5 systems, this window should open:</P>
<P><A HREF="img/listgui.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/listgui.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="57" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></P>
<P>
Nice, isn't it? This works with almost all shell programs that follow the Amiga-Style-guide. To be more specific: Those that use the &quot;ReadArgs()&quot; templates as they were defined by Commodore-Amiga for OS 2.0. If the user has written a batch file or an ARexx script which uses the &quot;ReadArgs()&quot; templates, too, &quot;r&quot; works just as well. If you start the batch file &quot;S:DPAT&quot; with:
</P>
<PRE>
r &quot;execute s:dpat&quot;
</PRE>
<P>
you get this GUI:
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/dpatgui.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/dpatgui.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="43" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
But &quot;r&quot; loses it with programs that define their arguments in a non-standard way. This mostly means old programs from Kick1.3 and quick-and-dirty ports from UNIX/BSD/M$ platforms (like ports of 3D shooters like Quark, Duum and Hermetic), but sadly also some new programs like &quot;mpega&quot;.

<H3>PowerWindows(NG):</H3>
<P>
One more patch. Some people might already know about PowerWindows, since some other publications have already written about it. But time doesn't stand still, and a lot of things have changed in this program.
</P>
<P>
PowerWindows is an OS patch that enables the user to move windows beyond the borders of the screen (as known from MacOS and Windows), to iconify windows, to move them with their contents (&quot;Opaque-Move&quot;), and some other things.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/powerwin.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/powerwin.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="91" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
In the -for patch- very extensive distribution you'll find two different binaries. One is called PowerWindows, the other PowerWindowsNG. The NG-version requires the ROM remapper Blitzkick or a patched ROM image of the AmigaOS. A ROM module for Blitzkick is included. This module changes some ROM routines in a way that makes it &quot;safer&quot; to use PowerWindowsNG. Also included (Thank god!) is a preferences editor for changing the appearance and functionality of PowerWindows.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/pwprefs.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/pwprefs.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
This can also be done via shell arguments. But configuring using shell would be real work, since the preferences editor already requires a lot from the user. A help function that explains each button is integrated, but unfortunately this explanation is sometimes less clear than the label on the button itself. So in any case you should read the English manual. And even this doesn't always help, because Georg Steger's knowledge of English is at least as good as mine ;). But most functions are understandable, and a few others can be interpreted by using some imagination even without the manual.
</P>
<P>
But it's going to take you some time to configure PowerWindowsNG so that your system is as stable as it was without the patch. All the functions of PowerWindows are less than useful if the computer keeps freezing in &quot;stress situations&quot;. You have to check all your programs for bad behavior: this includes fast resizing of windows, low memory situations, of course &quot;moving the window out of the screen&quot; and the behavior of screens with different color depths (e.g. AGA and 8bit screens). If a program has problems, it can be &quot;left out&quot; in the PowerWindows preferences.
</P>
<P>
The documentation says PowerWindows needs an Amiga with OS 2.0 (probably) and is compatible with the common graphic card drivers. A fast CPU, 32-bit Fast RAM and other hardware to speed up the computer won't harm either.
PowerWindows, at least the tested version, is compatible with OS 3.5.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, Georg Steger has stopped development of this software because he wanted to invest more time in the AROS project. But he has released it as OpenSource to the Amiga community. The manual sometimes still says that PowerWindows is Shareware, but the README to the archive has this corrected.

<H3>HappyENV:</H3>
<P>
And finally a real classic. HappyENV is a little older, which makes me wonder even more how I never read anything about it. Time to do something about this.
</P>
<P>
HappyENV replaces the assign &quot;ENV:&quot;, which is normally only a directory in the &quot;Ram Disk&quot;, by a &quot;real&quot; drive. This drive is comparable with the &quot;Ram Disk&quot;, but the &quot;HappyENV&quot; drive has some advantages. In the &quot;Ram Disk&quot;, environment variables always require at least 1KB (1024 Bytes), even though most variables are much smaller. Some are as small as 1 Byte. If those small files take up a thousandfold of their size in RAM, it is an enormous waste of space. Furthermore, all environment variables are copied from &quot;ENVARC:&quot; to &quot;ENV:&quot; during bootup, even if the program that uses a variable is not running, or has been uninstalled. When using &quot;HappyENV&quot;, variables are not copied until programs ask for them. This noticeably speeds up the booting process, especially if, over time, several megabytes have accumulated in the &quot;ENVARC:&quot; assign.
</P>
<P>
If a program (be it the Workbench, the shell, or during the bootup) needs a certain environment variable, HappyENV intercepts the access to &quot;ENV:&quot;. Then it looks inside &quot;ENVARC:&quot; to find the file or directory and copies it to the drive created by HappyENV. Then the calling program works on as if nothing happened. The user doesn't notice it at all, but he has a lot of free RAM for more important things and the computer boots faster. Isn't this something?
</P>
<P>
Installation is relatively easy. The directory of HappyENV contains, besides the English documentation and the source directory, two files required for installation.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/happyenv.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/happyenv.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="33" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The file &quot;HappyENV-Handler&quot; has to be copied to the directory &quot;L:&quot;, and &quot;MountENV&quot; is best stored in the directory &quot;C:&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Now for the (somewhat) more complicated part. In the startup-sequence, you have to find the section where the directory &quot;Ram:ENV&quot; is created and the environment variables are copied from &quot;ENVARC:&quot; to &quot;ENV:&quot;. These entries have to be removed first. In the original startup-sequence of OS 3.5 these entries look like this:
</P>
<PRE>
C:MakeDir &gt;NIL: RAM:T RAM:Clipboards RAM:ENV RAM:ENV/Sys
C:Copy &gt;NIL: ENVARC: RAM:ENV ALL NOREQ
</PRE>
<P>
The second line (&quot;C:Copy &gt;NIL:...&quot;) has to be commented out or removed completely, and first line must be changed to this:
</P>
<PRE>
C:MakeDir &gt;NIL: RAM:T RAM:Clipboards
</PRE>
<P>
Then look below for the line...
</P>
<PRE>
Assign &gt;NIL: ENV: ENVARC:
</PRE>
<P>
... and replace it by...
</P>
<PRE>
C:MountENV
</PRE>
<P>
... and you're done. If you could not make any sense of the instructions above, try to find someone to help you. The HappyENV-documentation explains it more thoroughly, too.
