<P>
This will be it ...
</P>
<P>
... for this year. Again (nearly) twelve months have passed by, and no new Amiga released. And again a number of Amiga users will perform the usual ritual and say: If it doesn't happen next year then they had their last chance - as they predicted at the ends of 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996 and 1995. With a significant difference: This time their prophecy will be valid, this time it really is &quot;do or die&quot;.
</P>
<P>
If in the next twelve months the AmigaDE is not released in a version for the end user (or if this release disappoints the high expectations of the users), the very last chance for a rebirth of the Amiga will be gone forever.
</P>
<P>
The market will keep on shrinking right up until release day. I see almost no more companies developing for the Amiga. Those that have held out until now will some day breathe their last - and this will certainly not take several years, if you consider today's numbers of Amiga-software sales.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore the competition are not asleep. AMIGA is not the only company trying to bring to market an operating system with hardware independence at the binary level. So this is a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
But I am and will stay optimistic. Not so much about the PowerPC extensions planned by Eyetech, the realization of which - please forgive me - I cannot believe in, but about the AmigaDE - and this is the main point. After the new OS has reached the market for one processor system it will not take long for more series of CPUs to be supported.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, true fans of the PowerPC should not be asking when the AmigaDE will be released in a PowerPC version, but when it will appear at all.
</P>
<P>
And so I wish you all a merry Christmas and a good start into the
year 2001.
</P>
