<H2>2. Questions concerning the use of Amiga sound formats with Windows</H2>
<P>
I'd like to pose a question which has puzzled me for quite a while.
</P>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I used Amigas for approx. 12 years, and then because of professional reasons (system administrator) I could not spend any more time with the Amiga and changed to PC and UNIX!&nbsp;</TD></TR>

Well, I did not really forget the Amiga and I am very curious about the future. :-)))
</P>
<P><B>And here is my concern:</B></P>
<P>
During my days with the Amiga I did a lot in the field of music. Even now I own several 880KB floppies with Amiga File System, containing my songs.
</P>
<P>
Firstly: How do I get the files to a PC, when I do not have an Amiga? In former times there was a perfect way with CrossDOS!!!
</P>
<P>
And secondly: I had composed the songs with different proggies. One was by Maxon (can't remember the name). Are there in the PC range plug-ins for Winamp or similar, which I can use to play my old songs?
</P>
<P>
It would really be great if I could hear my songs again!
</P>
