Christian Sobotta of the ACSYS developer team announced that only 50 have said they would buy ACSYS when 500 persons were needed.

Nearly every month there is an announcement by Hyperion Software and so it is this month, too. This time it is the PC game Majesty that Hyperion are bringing to the Amiga, in the first quarter of 2001. It will run on a PPC Amiga with WarpOS, 48 MB RAM and a graphic board. A version for the 68060 is unsure at this stage. Hyperion said they would not have a representative at the World of Amiga fair but they would show several games.
