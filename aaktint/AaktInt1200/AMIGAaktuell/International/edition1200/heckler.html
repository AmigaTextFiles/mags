<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>Flying Horses</B></P>
<P>
Noise in the house .... slowly I wake up. It is a Saturday morning and I had a hard Friday night. It is Beaujolais Primeur time on planet Earth. This wonderful occasion has thrown its spell over me, too.
</P>
<P>
First I open the left eye, then the right one. I try to catch a clear thought. What happened last night?! Into the hard and cruel reality of a Saturday morning slowly tiptoe memories of many senseless words which this dainty red wine elicited from me.
</P>
<P>
Then events go head over heels .... the phone rings, the alarm-clock rattles, the doorbell chimes .... and in my head it rings, rattles, chimes as well .... everything is ringing, the whole world!!
</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I stay in bed in spite of this torture. A thought flashes through my mind: Who the hell is taking the risk of bothering me!?! And so many at the same moment ...&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I try to stretch my arms. My face, distorted by a juicy yawning, must look excruciating. But no worries. I don't give a hoot about the troublemakers and compose my emotions for my breakfast. I decide to elect this idea to be the best of the young day. Even though I know that my gustatory neural system will play havoc with me.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I open the can with the breakfast meat .... mmmhhh, looks like the fodder of my cat which deceased a few years ago. That roll has seen better days as well. And the coffee ... so what, it can prepare itself.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
As my sensorial cells pine for &quot;the good ole days&quot;, when I did not have to spend a single thought on shopping (food didn't taste any better in those days, but I could put the blame on somebody else), I catch an idea shuffling past: I sure hope OS 3.9 doesn't work like my breakfast tastes.
</P>
<P>
Little differences undoubtedly exist: The screenshots on the Internet don't look like cat's fodder. And OS 3.9 will come in a cardboard box. But I can't get rid of the thought that they want to sell us something out of a can. My &quot;girlfriend&quot;, her parts slowly breaking down, is to get a new heart. Or, in better words, a new cardiac pacemaker for her old heart (Kick 3.1-ROMs). And the price for this is about 80 German pebbles?
</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I don't want to rehash the old discussion &quot;Amiga software always was a bit more expensive because of its low sales numbers&quot;, when I exceptionally disclaim the price to be adequate. Anyhow, the suspicion lingers that behind the claim &quot;Whether there will be an OS 4.0 for the Classic will only be decided by the sales numbers of OS 3.9&quot; may be the idea, finally, to make bangers out of that old horse. I believe a lower price would have been appropriate. Just to get better sales numbers ....&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Now back to breakfast meat, my actual problem. The thought about horse bangers has definitively spoiled my appetite. Especially because the smell of this &quot;somewhat&quot; in the can really does not motivate consumption.
</P>
<P>
Faintly I moan to myself .... hoping OS 3.9 will become better.
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosperous (preferably without sausage out of the can)

P.S.: To the friendly baking housewives among the lady readers a modest hint: Christmas-Vanilla-bagels taste extremely nice .... (aah, ooh, eeh - didn't say a word ...)
