<H2>2. Edition 4 of Amiga World released - the most important news</H2>
<P>
Recently the fourth edition of AMIGA's online magazine Amiga World was released. Gernod Schomberg briefly outlines the content:
</P>
<H3>D'Amiga</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Five manufacturers: Wonder Computer (Canada), SoftwareHut (USA),
  KDH-Datentechnik (Germany), Unitech Electronics (Australia),
  Eyetech (UK)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Due to the availability of the Linux software there exist differences:
  RedHat is not readily available in Europe, therefore SuSE is used here.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Periphery is independent from the operating system! But all new
  applications must be able to run on the default basic version specified by AMIGA.
</LI>
<BR><LI> All manufacturers offer support for their machines.
</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Business, Amiga Style</H3>
<P><B>An interview with Vince Pfeiffer</B></P>
<P>
Vince started his carrier in the computer software business in 1990 at Symantec. After he had attained the position of Vice President of Product Development in this group he changed to GraphOn, which during his time quadrupled their sales. He then returned to his previous position at Symantec.
</P>
<P>
He joined AMIGA because here he had the possibility to build up not only one department but a whole company in a way he believed in.
</P>
<P>
He expresses very interesting ideas concerning the development of the software technology.
</P>
<H3>Developer Notes - Fall 2000</H3>
<P>
Gary Peake explains the possibilities of information for developers.
</P>
<P><B>Some important points:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> He states, that to date, Amiga Inc. has not released any decision on the bus architecture, CPU, nor have any other hardware choices been made for the Hardware Reference designs.
</LI>
<BR><LI> There have been references to what some consider a mistake being made, when AmigaDE is called a &quot;Run Time&quot; system. AmigaDE is a Real Time OS.
<P>
  It is also designed to be a RUN TIME system for applications. This is NOT an error and has been discussed several times now on the Open Amiga Developer List.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<H3>First Impressions of the Software Developers Kit</H3>
<P>
Extensive, very interesting description of the SDK with examples and impressive screen grabs.
</P>
<H3>Installing the Software Development Kit on Linux</H3>
<P>
An informally written introduction into the installation of the SDK.
</P>
<H3>Making the Digital Environment talk Sheep</H3>
<P>
This article about the new scripting and programming language for
AmigaDE with the internal working name &quot;Sheep&quot; by Wouter van Oortmerssen is very detailed and well worth the read.
