<P><B>Amiga Forever 4.0 - Overview</B></P>
<P>
Amiga Forever contains state of the art software to satisfy two major needs of
many Amiga users: to share data between Amiga and other systems, and to use
their existing Amiga software and data on non-Amiga hardware. Additionally,
software, tutorial and reference files which are likely to be of interest to
any Amiga enthusiast are included with the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Forever 4.0 includes:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> Officially licensed Amiga ROM and OS files, versions 1.3 and 3.1. The CD-ROM
  includes additional versions of historical interest (all generic versions
  between 1.0 and 3.1 that have been officially released ).
</LI>
<BR><LI> Amiga Explorer 3.5 networking software, which allows you to connect an Amiga
  to one or more PCs, and access Amiga files (including virtual ADF and ROM
  files), directories and volumes directly from the Windows Desktop. Amiga
  Explorer is easy to install and configure and includes direct support for
  serial (null modem) cable connections, as well as TCP/IP. Automatic
  installation of the Amiga side through the same serial cable which can later
  be used by the software itself. No additional terminal program, PC filing
  system or other tools are required. Before Amiga Explorer 3.5 this used to
  be considered an impossible task!
</LI>
<BR><LI> Dave Haynie's legendary Deathbed Vigil Video ... a documentation about the
  last hours of Commodore with lots of interviews, a view into the buildings
  and the final discharge party ...
</LI>
<BR><LI> Exclusive interview with Jay Miner, &quot;Father of the Amiga&quot;, on topics ranging
  from the birth of the Amiga to computers and society in form of an audio
  track.
</LI>
<BR><LI> UAE Amiga emulator for Windows (&quot;WinUAE&quot;). All emulation support files
  (Amiga ROM and OS, Cloanto Amiga software, Picasso 96 drivers, etc.) can
  easily be used by other implementations (DOS, Linux, Be, Next, etc.) of
  these emulators, as well as by future new versions. On the CD-ROM version
  the Fellow emulator for DOS and experimental versions of UAE for PowerPC
  Amiga and PowerMac systems are also included. Source code for the emulation
  software (including the Linux version of UAE) is included in the &quot;Archives&quot;
  directory of the CD-ROM.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Picasso 96 drivers for the emulation software, supporting palette modes up
  to 256 colors, as well as true color.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Cloanto Personal Paint 7.1b (paint, animation and image processing software,
  with short tutorials), DirDiff 5.1 (file synchronization and replication
  software), AmiToRTF 4.2 (to convert texts from Amiga to Windows formats) and
  MailBX to convert Amiga mail archives to Microsoft Mail, Outlook Express and
  Exchange Server. A copy of these programs is installed in a directory which
  is easily accessible from &quot;real&quot; Amiga systems.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Bonus software by third parties, such as the TurboText editor (an exclusive
  version with the latest patches), KingCON, archiving and extraction tools,
  all preinstalled for easy drag-and-drop functionality with ToolManager.
  Documentation for this software is available from the Amiga (emulation) side
</LI>
<BR><LI> Tutorials and FAQs on data sharing, emulation, floppy disks, serial links,
  TCP/IP, UAE, Fellow and much more.
</LI>
<BR><LI> The CD-ROM is a multi-platform CD (ISO, Rock-Ridge Amiga, Joliet and Audio).
  The Macintosh files, which contain a ready-to-run (experimental) PowerMac
  configuration, are contained in a StuffIt archive.
</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Supported Platforms</B></P>
<P>
The Amiga emulation software comes preinstalled and preconfigured for Windows
and DOS on Intel platforms. The Amiga ROM and OS files can be used by any
implementation of the Amiga emulators, including for example Unix/Linux (UAE
comes with source code), Be, PowerMac, etc. These emulators are constantly
updated, and can be downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The emulation software included with Amiga Forever does not require a &quot;real&quot;
Amiga. On Windows systems, the emulation can be either installed or run
directly from CD (without installation). The ready-to-run (experimental)
PowerMac version is included in a StuffIt archive, from where it can be
extracted to the Macintosh hard disk.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Explorer and Documentation</B></P>
<P>
The Amiga Explorer software, the automatic program launcher and the
automatic installation software are specifically designed for Windows. The
Amiga Explorer networking software is independent from the emulation part,
and can be installed separately.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga software and documentation included in Amiga Forever are completely
independent from both the networking and the emulation components, and can be
accessed on an Amiga computer, or from the emulation environment. The Amiga
software and documentation are also preinstalled in the Amiga Forever
emulation environment.
</P>
<P>
The main Amiga Forever documentation is in HTML format, and can be read with
any web browser. The Amiga-specific documentation is in AmigaGuide format,
and in part also in HTML. The main documentation is in English. The
documentation of Personal Paint is in English, German and Italian. Some Amiga
emulation tutorials by third parties are in German, French, Polish and
Italian. The Amiga ROM and OS files on Amiga Forever include localizations
in all languages supported by the Amiga OS.&laquo;
