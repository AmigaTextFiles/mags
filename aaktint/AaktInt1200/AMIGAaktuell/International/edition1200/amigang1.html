<H2>1. New Executive Update from AMIGA's president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Executive Update</B></P>
<P><B>Dear Amiga Family:</B></P>
<P>
It is now November 2000, eleven months after we took over the helm of
Amiga. We have made some changes to the original plan, and continue to do
our best in carrying the vision forward.
</P>
<P>
In the next two weeks, the next new product from Amiga will begin shipping
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Amiga OS 3.9! This build has been designed specifically for one group -
</LI>
</UL>
You, the Amiga family. We have been working very closely with Haage and
Partner in creating a great new product offering for Amiga that you will
all be very proud of.
<P>
Will there be a 4.0? This really depends on the sales of OS 3.9. You see,
we did not have any plans for another version of the Classic OS. But we
continued to receive requests, and because we listen to community, we
decided to move ahead with Haage and Partner on this project. If OS 3.9
sells well, and we see a continuing need to produce for the existing
Classic Amiga platform, then there is a strong possibility of a 4.0.
</P>
<P>
It is in your hands.
</P>
<P>
No matter what happens, AmigaDE is still moving ahead quickly and we look
forward to delivering another version of the Amiga Software Development
Kit (SDK) with new features and enhancements. In the coming weeks, we will
be adding 3D and sound to AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
There are many more exciting things happening at Amiga and I look forward
to sharing with you all of the great details, and announcements in Koln,
Germany in December. I look forward to meeting all of you there, at the
Amiga World tradeshow. Bring a friend!
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to a great visit in Koln, and a wonderful holiday season,
</P>
<P>
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga team.&laquo;
