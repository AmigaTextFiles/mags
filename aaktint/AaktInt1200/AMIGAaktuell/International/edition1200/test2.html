<H2>2. CD-ROM test: &raquo;The Kickstart Archives&laquo; (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P><B>Kickstart with a difference</B></P>
<P>
Some days ago, I received a little parcel that contained an unspectacular silver disk. Thomas Unger [1] had sent me his CD-ROM called &quot;The Kickstart Archives&quot; for a test.
The CD-ROM, which was tested in version 0.9 and which is filled with approximately 500 Mbyte of data, is centered about only one topic:
</P>
<P><B>The history of the Amiga</B></P>
<P>
It mostly contains mirrored web sites, which offer to the Amiga fan dreaming in front of a monitor large amounts of background information, stories, people, emulators, models, clones and support files for the Amiga.
</P>
<P><B>System requirements</B></P>
<P>
Since the contents of the CD-ROM are mostly web sites that have been indexed, your Amiga should have a web browser (are there still Amigas without one?) and you are set.
</P>
<P>
From time to time you will stumble over formats that require additional software, like PDF documents or videos in MPEG or AVI format.
</P>
<P>
Because the CD-ROM is based on HTML, it should work on any operating system that supports HTML. Besides AmigaOS it also works very well under Windows, but if you want to use a UNIX-style operating system, you will stumble over many faulty links. These operating systems differentiate between lower-case and capital letters, but the HTML files on the CD often don't. That's why links to pictures, videos or other texts end up with a &quot;Not found&quot;. A pity.
But this shouldn't bother Amigans on an Amiga. They won't notice such problems.
</P>
<P><B>Contents of the CD-ROM</B></P>
<P>
The file &quot;index.html&quot; in the root directory of the CD-ROM represents the table of contents and is the starting point into the depths of Amiga history.
The &quot;Kickstart Archives&quot; are divided in nine sections:
</P>

</TABLE>
<P><B><A HREF="img/kickIndex.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/kickIndex.jpg" WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Some parts of the documents are in German, but most are English.
</P>
<P><B>I. The History of Commodore and Amiga</B></P>
<P>
The first section is dedicated to the history of the Amiga, which is inevitably connected to the history of Commodore. The 21, some of which are very extensive, articles are not only interesting because of the historic facts, but also because of the personal insights of the respective author. To review all of them is beyond the space restrictions of this article, so just to pick a few of the mostly very well written texts: Regular readers of Amiga aktuell already know Reiner Benda's story of the fall of Commodore from the point of view of a longtime employee. Gregor Franz, known as publisher of the online magazine &quot;AmZeiger&quot; shows his version of the &quot;Amiga-Historie&quot;. Amiga Auckland Inc. spread the arch from Pre-Amiga time 1977 to 1999. A look inside the company Commodore-Amiga gives &quot;Tom's Commodore Emulation Site&quot; with six MPEG videos shot by Dave Haynie himself. Among other things, you will see a circuitboard of the never-to-be-manufactured AAA chips.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A contribution in several parts by the Amiga-Magazin from the year 1995 on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Amiga takes you back to glory days. And if you always wanted to see the secret messages in the AmigaOS, hidden by the developers, you can find detailed instructions here (as well as in other articles).&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Thomas Unger, a specialist in commercial law, enriches the CD-ROM with the Amiga's own patent story. In version 0.9, there are only three chapters in German, where you can read some basics about patents themselves, the patents in the context of the Amiga's history and the hardware design of the Amiga. Release 1.0 is to contain many more chapters.
The included patents in PDF formats could not be read with Apdf. PDF readers from other operating systems had no problems.
</P>
<P><B>II. Amiga persons</B></P>
<P>
Section No. 2 is dedicated to outstanding Amiga personalities. Three chapters are dedicated to the owner of the dog, who is commonly recognized as the father of the Amiga. Jay G. Miner just has to be included on such a compilation, but in addition Carl Sassenrath, R.J. Mical, Andy Finkel, Dave Haynie and Lew Eggebrecht get their well-deserved honor.
</P>
<P><B>III. Official Amiga Machines</B></P>
<P>
As you would expect, you can find here all official machines from Commodore or subsequent owners.
</P>
<P>
Even crew members of the U.S.S. enterprise have a liking for Amiga. Mr. Spock shows his web site with technical descriptions and a lot of pictures. The virtual Amiga Museum of the Amiga User Group 99 has its place here, too.
</P>
<P><B>IV. Clones and Emulators</B></P>
<P>
The fourth section shows the existing and the, alas, not existing Amiga clones and emulators. Like the A\Box from the now bankrupt company phase5, which was marketed with a lot of effort (for an Amiga project), but never went into production. Also the A5000 (not only the technical parameters, but also a circuitboard) and the A6000 from DCE. The BoXer is an almost never-ending story: several web sites deal with it and the Siamese System. Even in far China there was an Amiga clone: a system called REC Wonder-TV A6000, that looked very much like a CDTV but was more a modified CD-32 on the inside. The DraCo almost seems like an alien object, because it really existed. The web site in Dutch is remarkable.
</P>
<P><B>V. Amiga Operating Systems</B></P>
<P><B>Very informative and illustrative is the &quot;Workbench Nostalgia&quot;</B></P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/kickWBNost.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/kickWBNost.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
by Gregory Donner, which contains all released and beta versions of the Workbench. The second article in the section, the &quot;AmigaDOS Online Reference Manual&quot;, has a hard time to keep up against this. Still, this information shouldn't be interesting to nostalgic people only.
</P>
<P><B>VI. Peripherals</B></P>
<P>
Over the years, peripherals kept getting more and more important, even a fountain of youth for the aging hardware. Ian Chapman lists almost every peripheral in his &quot;Big Book of Amiga Hardware&quot;, be it digitizer, bridgeboard, emulator board, genlock, turbo or graphics board, to name just a few, with their technical data and often also pictures. Doug Spence documents an input device from the early Amiga days, the &quot;Amiga Joyboard&quot;, which had its share in creating the &quot;guru mediations&quot;. The hardware guide &quot;LexSite&quot; concludes the sixth section.
</P>
<P><B>VII. Support</B></P>
<P>
In the 15 articles in the support section you will find a lot of FAQs, hardware references, and descriptions of cables and adapters. Overclocking is a topic, too. Especially interesting are pages with DMS files of Amiga software, like Reiner Benda's &quot;Support Page&quot; with Amiga circuit diagrams, dem disks, EPROM files, etc.
</P>
<P>
Or Brad Barnett's &quot;Installers' Haven&quot; with install disks for hard disk controllers, Ethernet and turbo boards, to name just a few.
</P>
<P><B>VIII. Specials</B></P>
<P>
Section eight contains a virtual computer museum, the legendary Amiga-juggler animations described in words and pictures as well as an AVI file, an interesting &quot;Workbench Release&quot;, the web site of the &quot;Jay Miner Society&quot;, an &quot;Amiga History Gallery&quot; with pictures and the &quot;Commodore and Amiga Advert&quot; collection from 1983 through 1999.
</P>
<P><B>IX. Disclaimer</B></P>
<P>
The title says it all: Thomas Unger makes some basic remarks regarding the contents of the &quot;Kickstart Archives&quot; and some notes about legal issues.
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion</B></P>
<P>
The &quot;Kickstart Archives&quot; are, even in version 0.9, an almost bottomless source of information about our favourite computer for an acceptable price. Thomas Unger sees this CD-ROM as a pure hobby project and sells the &quot;Kickstart Archives&quot; for a cost price of 20,- DM or 10,- US-$. He [1] produces and mails copies upon request. If you are interested in solid background information besides the software, you can read for hours.
In spite of the noted HTML problem, a well done and recommendable CD-ROM.
