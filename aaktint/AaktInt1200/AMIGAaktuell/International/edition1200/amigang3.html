<H2>3. Reflections: &raquo;CLASSIC or ONE&laquo; (by Stefan Czinczoll)</H2>
<P>
On 9th of December at the WOA 2000 in Cologne the new ClassicOS will be released.
</P>
<P>
According to producer Haage &amp; Partner it will have the following features, among others:
</P>

<BR><LI> WarpOS 5.0 (PowerPC-Kernel)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Iomega tools (drivers for ZIP and JAZ Drives)
</LI>
<BR><LI> New Profi-Shell (with extensive adjustments)
</LI>
<BR><LI> PPC native picture datatype
</LI>
<BR><LI> Fast search function
</LI>
<BR><LI> Comfortable decrunchers (for lha, lzx, and zip formats)
</LI>
<BR><LI> ASLPrefs (Filerequester preference)
</LI>
<BR><LI> New file-info interaction box
</LI>

</LI>
<BR><LI> New colour-wheel adjustment
</LI>
<BR><LI> Font caching
</LI>
<BR><LI> Documentation (HTML) in English and German
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
For me this list was convincing enough to place my order right away.
And now for the details:
</P>
<P>
The change from Miami to Genesis is all right, if they do not give us a functionally reworked version (cue: DHCP).
</P>
<P>
The term &quot;Profi-Shell&quot; startled me, because it sounds a bit like a marketing trick. Is it a self produced article or is it the popular KingCON? Or a CSH variation? I'd plead for a shell with corresponding functionality at least, should there (against all expectations) be a Classic Version 4.0.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;Fast Search Function&quot; as a part of the OS certainly is a good thing, for which many users have been waiting a long time.
</P>
<P>
It would be desirable to have the documentation as extensive as possible. An edition in just one language for a lower bundle price and as compensation a printed manual would probably be too much to hope for. ;-)
</P>
<P>
In an Executive Update, Bill considers the chances of another version after AmigaOS 3.9 or of development ceasing. He says it depends on the number of sales. I'd urge as many users as possible to buy the latest Classic OS to support the project development of AmigaDE (and Elate/RTOS). The Amiverse must grow ...
</P>
<P>
To make the latter project a success the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the Classic OS ought to be part of the new development. For me especially the file system is important, old as it is. You don't have to shut down the computer the way you have to in the Linux/Unix world and there are not those annoying and well-known Microscrap Windblows hang-ups. (If for synergistics reasons using a Linux-based FS cannot be avoided, then a polite request to switch off the system is necessary :-) ).
</P>
<P>
Alternatively a new development with dynamic caching seems desirable, with security no worse than with the FS45.1. A tool like Dave Haynie's famous Disksalv for data salvation or undelete after an accidental delete beyond the 4 GB limit is a must for a reputable OS. Considering today's IDE HD sizes the maximum address range ought to be supported.
</P>
<P>
Corel has withdrawn from the Linux market as distributor. Elate and the Amiverse would get a boost from a port of the successful Corel Draw - the success of an OS depends largely on the available software!
</P>
