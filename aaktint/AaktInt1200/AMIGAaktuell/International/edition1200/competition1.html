Two participants could not make up their mind on a specific answer.
</P>
<P>
-------------<BR>
Several contributors added comments to their answers:
</P>
<P>
Ewald Rensen has a rather positive view of the announcements: &raquo;After many setbacks in the past now there are at least some substantial plans to set up something new.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
In the view of Stefan Wiegele many questions remain open: &raquo;At last the development of the Amiga proceeds. I for myself feel the top priority is that the old Amiga will be supported in the future.
</P>
<P>
What should I think about AmigaOne? I do not know! Anyhow, what is it? A PC? Half an Amiga? In my opinion it is important that I will be able to use my old software in the future, even when I buy a new computer.
</P>
<P>
What will it be, Amiga 4000 &amp; Predator (Mediator) or AmigaOne? I still keep asking, why no progression is possible with the existing hardware!
</P>
<P>
Are the costs too high or is the current hardware not fit for development anymore? Nobody knows knows the exact &quot;look&quot; of next year's Amiga. What will be the price? Presently there is much talk about which hardware components are necessary or are not.
</P>
<P>
Finally, some people will look quite silly when it comes out completely different from what they imagine today.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Peter Kuehne is convinced of the new Amiga concept: &raquo;The whole project of AmigaDE looks quite promising. Nevertheless it is just an idea, it still has to be realised.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Dirk Hase criticizes the shut-down of AMIGA Germany: &raquo;The announcement that the branch office in Langen/Germany will close makes me rather gloomy. A few months ago Bill McEwen stated that they were looking for distribution partners and that they wanted to extend the European office network. What do we now think of that???
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I do understand that over in the USA they have to economize to put money into the new project, but at least the spare parts store should be kept. I cannot imagine that Amiga will ship everything to the USA and start sales there.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The extensions for the Classic Amigas have just been announced and therefore there ought to be support for spare parts. Or will we have to cannibalize the last Classics??? This certainly is not reasonable and in several cases even impossible.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: I believe Bill McEwen ought to think over what he is doing, because without the existing Amiga community the possibilities of AMIGA getting things moving are much inferior than with the help and the support of people who have been on board for decades.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I sincerely hope we all will experience a rebirth of the Amiga.&laquo;&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Andreas Wolf tersely states: &raquo;Well, this is, what every true Amiga-friend is hoping for: G3/G4 for Classics and a new main board based on PPC.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolf Zimmer has a rather negative take on the new announcements: &raquo;The latest statements remind me of the chorus of a song by Ernst Reuter [Transl. note: late German songwriter and vocalist]: &quot;And now we'll really start right away&quot;.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A clear statement, easy to understand and on the first look quite obvious. But after thinking it over a bit longer you are not so sure that you know anything.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
And that's exactly how I regard the latest release.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Mai has a positive view of AMIGA's way: &raquo;I consider the announcements of AMIGA, Inc. just great. But a niggling worry whether a company that small with a new product can make its mark against overwhelming competitors.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise I am excited about the new OS and firmly intend to purchase the AmigaOne 1200. The waiting time will be shortened by the OS 3.9 release, which came as a very positive surprise to me.
</P>
<P>
Beside this, I wish AMIGA more luck than it had in past years.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Frank Leyendecker demands that the new operating system contain a Classic Amiga emulation: &raquo;I believe that Classic software ought to run on a new Amiga, otherwise it will become a dead duck like BeOS.
</P>
<P>
If I understood it right an emulation is being thought about, but there should definitely be one, or else a part of the Amiga market will be lost.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Emanuel Mair's comments take the same line: &raquo;The only negative thing about Amiga's latest announcements is the delayed, and even unsure, built-in transparent Amiga Classic emulation of the AmigaDE.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Krister S. Skrtic is afraid of losing the Amiga feeling: &raquo;I don't know that much about all the new stuff - about this new AmigaDE and AmigaOne - some of this sounds interesting, but I fear AmigaDE is going to be just another PC without the Amiga feeling and without the way AmigaOS works with all its ease of use. I hope it will be good, and the possibility of working on most CPUs is great, but otherwise I just can't make up my mind.
</P>
<P>
Until then I'll keep using my Classic Amiga and hope it will grow up with the new PCI stuff.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg ticked &raquo;rather positive&laquo; and states: &raquo;I wanted to choose &raquo;very positive&laquo;, because it really looks like things are moving on the hardware side. I lowered my rating to &raquo;rather positive&laquo; because I had hoped to find my new computer wrapped up in a parcel under the Xmas tree.
</P>
<P>
But I do see it as a positive that they did not take a quick shot with the possibility of a miss. It looks like it will not become a blown-up PC clone.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Aichinger cannot make up his mind: &raquo;Because a whole lot of info appeared from AMIGA I cannot make a general statement concerning the question of opinion.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I believe Eyetech's announcement is very positive, if Eyetech can bring it to fulfilment. The day I can see and touch &quot;Zico&quot;, I will express my opinion about this device. Right now it (he? she?) is just a specification upon a sheet of paper, nothing else!&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The specification itself does not sound worldshaking - what would be worldshaking is the software, i.e. the OS to run on Zico. And this is not a &quot;new&quot; announcement of AMIGA, but was published early in this year.
</P>
<P>
OS 3.9 sounds very good as well. But certainly there are many in trouble: where has BoingBag 2 disappeared to, will it be released or not?
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A jarring note is the notice of the retirement of Petro. Please don't misunderstand me - I really wish Petro all the best and I have no bad thoughts about him, but the timing of this announcement was as adverse as possible. The general commotion over BoingBag 2 and OS 3.9 would have been more than enough. Couldn't he have waited to announce his departure until AFTER the settlement of the problem with &quot;BoingBag 2 / OS 3.9&quot;?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Somehow this reminds me of old Commodore times. Didn't AMIGA learn from this?&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Summary:</B></P>
<P>
An overwhelmimg majority is on the whole satisfied by the latest announcements from AMIGA.
</P>
<P>
There were critics of the close-down of AMIGA Germany, the details of the AmigaNG project and the policy of announcements by the enterprise.
