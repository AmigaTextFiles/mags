<H2>2. Letter to the Editor about the recent Situation of the Amiga (by Guido Bruns)</H2>
<P>
Spoken in clear words all this must be called sh.. - even bullsh..
isn't too harsh!
</P>
<P>
Since the information policy of AMIGA hasn't improved at all, I think,
it would now be the time for an upheaval with the cry &quot;We are the people&quot;
[translator's note: &quot;Wir sind das Volk&quot; was the chorus of protest used by
Germans living in DDR, which led to the German reunification], and think
of ways we (the people) can manage a change.
</P>
<P>
The power of the one is nothing against the power of the many!
</P>
<P>
A public Amiga community collectively demands what is needed now, and
that is facts, facts, facts!
</P>
<P>
Every time I read an Executive Update by Bill McEwen, it occurs to me more
trivial than the one before; what could be the reason, dear Bill?
</P>
<P>
How about a &quot;Facts&quot; section by AMIGA, Inc.? All this babbling does not help
anybody!
</P>
<P>
What I miss are clear statements, and this means bad news as well.
</P>
<P>
What would it take for all Amiga firms and users to
tell AMIGA where we want to go? Sure, this is not an easy job, because
everybody interested has their own opinion. Nevertheless there are
many issues nearly everyone agrees on.
</P>
<P>
By the way, I have a name for this community:
