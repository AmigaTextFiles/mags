<H2>4. Holger Kruse (&raquo;Miami&laquo;) about his current Amiga-activities</H2>
<P><B>Nordic Global (<A HREF="http://www.nordicglobal.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.nordicglobal.com</A>) informs:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;I am afraid during the last year I have had virtually no time for
Amiga-related things, have not been able to respond to communication on a
regular basis, and my Amigas along with parts of my user and registration list
have been powered down for quite a while. This is unlikely to change any time
soon, although I expect to have some time during the next two months to at least
partially catch up with email and help with registration-related issues. Whether
I will have time for further development and participation in mailing lists etc.
I don't know yet. Recently users have tried to contact me in very aggressive
ways, e.g. through my employer. Please do NOT do that ! I cannot and will not
respond to any Miami-related query sent to my employer. At best any emails sent
there will be forwarded to my regular email address. Same for phone calls: my
private line is NOT a support line, I only pick up calls from known callers
(caller id), and support-related phone calls will not be returned. I h ave
neither the time nor the inclination to come home from work only to deal with
even more &quot;computer stuff&quot;. I am sure you understand. For urgent,
registration-related issues, bugs etc. please send email to
&quot;<A HREF="mailto:miami-support@nordicglobal.com">miami-support@nordicglobal.com</A>&quot;. This is a new mailbox, so far spam-free,
allowing me to respond a little more quickly than recently. It may still take a
week or two though, depending on how much time I have.&laquo;
