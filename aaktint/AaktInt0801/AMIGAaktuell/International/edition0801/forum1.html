<H2>1. This Month's Question - we'd like to know your opinion</H2>
<P>
In this section every month we will pose a question touching the
Amiga or offer a provocative statement (which we will later deny was
our opinion in any way, shape or form) for discussion hoping that many
of you will come forward with your opinion. Your statements will in
each case be published in the following edition. Please send them to
<A HREF="mailto:aakt@aakt.de">aakt@aakt.de</A>
</P>
<P>
Last month's provocation: &raquo;The manufacturers of Amiga browsers should
combine their efforts so they bring a competitive product of this kind
to the market.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>G&uuml;nter Lang (<A HREF="mailto:LASOWA@t-online.de">LASOWA@t-online.de</A>) states as follows:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;I sincerely welcome this proposal, but I cannot believe it will come
true.&laquo;
</P>

<P>
&raquo;Competitive? Against whom? A browser for the Amiga certainly only can
be competition for a browser on the Amiga. A PC user scarcely will
change to the Amiga, even if the &quot;VoyWebBrowse&quot; is better than IE! At
first other things should be doable on the Amiga! If you get a
higher speed and support of one or another adapter board only by
crisscross tucking of boards into your computer, this you can impose
at the most upon an old Amiga fan, but not upon a normal PC user.
</P>
<P>
Of course it would be a good thing for us to have a browser which can
do the things that are set as standards by others. But more important
is reasonable hardware supporting modern items in a simple way. And
the firmware (AmigaDE?) which might realize the ingenious idea
of Amiga's fathers to recognize and accept additional devices without
much ado! Because we live in modern times, perhaps even devices, which
are made for a completely different operating system :-)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
And here is the recent Question of the Month:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;What do you think about the announcement by Amiga of marketing an official
Amiga emulation for x86-computers?&laquo;
