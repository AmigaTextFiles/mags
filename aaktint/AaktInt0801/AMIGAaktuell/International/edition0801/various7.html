<P><B>Amiga Arena Full Version!</B></P>
<P>
In cooperation with Christian Steiner Amiga Arena makes possible
the free release of &quot;Sharks Multi Version 1.5 Final&quot;!
SHARKS! is a game of skills running under water. Our brave diver
is on his way to search the bottom of the sea for treasures.
But the area he is in is infested by sharks ... so WATCH OUT !!!
Recover as much treasure as possible and beware of the sharks!
Because of not sufficient feedback by the users the development
was cancelled!
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena &quot;File Cutter&quot; Code!</B></P>
<P>
Stefan Berge made available the code of File Cutter!
File Cutter makes it possible to split files to pieces. For instance
a file of 8 MB (animation, LHA archive) can be cut down to several
pieces each of a size, that this file easily can be transported on
several diskettes.
</P>
<P>
On the other computer these file parts can be assembled to the
complete file again.

rated &quot;The Prophet&quot; in those days with 81%. The Prophet now is
available in English language!

<P><B>Amiga Arena Status Report!</B></P>
<P>
Activities have recently run on a lower level due to holidays and
the insecure Amiga future!
In the make are several things, but I do not want to put you off
with pre-announcements!
(Unfortunately others do this more than sufficiently!) :-(
Getting special prices for shareware becomes harder and harder, too,
because there is nearly no shareware market any more!
I will be very grateful for ideas and hints!
And I still am looking for someone ready to translate texts and
interviews!&laquo;
