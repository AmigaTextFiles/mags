<H2>1. Amiga 1000 Phoenix, Legend or Truth? - Part 2 (by W. Brennecke)</H2>
<P>
While the first part was concentrated on the Phoenix board, I will now go
on to the specifications and show you some selected pictures.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to publish all the pictures we have made,
there are far too many. If I find the time, I will publish all pictures as
well as the scanned-in manual and the software on my homepage.
</P>
<P><B>So let's get going:</B></P>
<P>
The only means of identifying an A1000Phoenix are a sticker and 2 switches in the front
cover.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Phoenix_front.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Phoenix_front.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="75" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
On the right side, near the floppy drive, you'll see two switches. One is
for selecting the Kickstart ROM (the board can be equipped with three
different ROMs) and a DF0/DF2 toggle switch which makes it possible to boot
from an external floppy. This is ideal for games on 5.25&quot; disks. The
connectors on the back are identical to the ones on a standard A1000. The
only thing added was an (optionally available) external SCSI connector. The
little box on the video slot has nothing to do with the original computer,
it is just a modified A500 flickerfixer that has been adapted for use with
the A1000. I still have the complete instructions for the modification, if
anyone is interested. Just mail me :-)
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Phoenix_back.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Phoenix_back.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="51" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Now on to the (really interesting) inner life.
</P>
<P>
By the way: All (and I mean all) ICs have sockets, which makes repairs and
trouble shooting a lot easier.
</P>
<P><B>The SCSI host adapter</B></P>
<P>
In the lower right is the SCSI host adapter with one connector each for
internal and external SCSI devices. It's possible to mount a 3.5&quot; SCSI hard
disk (1&quot; high) inside the shielding plate. Mounting angles were available
as an accessory, you only had to make the notch yourself. The device
(pbscsi.device) already supported Autoboot (with Kick 1.3 or higher), RDB
rootblocks and SCSI Direct according to Commodore standard. I have
successfully used CD writers, streamers and scanners with this computer -
something you cannot say with some of the &quot;modern&quot; SCSI adapters.
</P>
<P><B>The Chip-RAM</B></P>
<P>
There are 8 sockets available for several types of DRAMs.
</P>
<P><B>Possibilities are:</B></P>
1MByte Chip RAM<BR>
1MByte Chip RAM / 1MByte Fast RAM<BR>
2 MByte Fast RAM (with suitable Agnus)<BR>
<P>
Of course you can use different Agnuses, you just have to set the right jumpers.
</P>
<P><B>The Video-Slot</B></P>
<P>
The computer has a video slot completely compatible with the A2000B. It is only useable
in
combination with a 90-degree adapter, since you couldn't close the case otherwise.
According
to the manual, such an adapter was available as an accessory.
</P>
<P><B>The ZorroII-Slot</B></P>
<P>
A fully compatible ZorroII slot, again only useful with an adapter.
</P>
<P><B>Memory-Slot</B></P>
<P>
A proprietary slot developed by Phoenix Technologies to support their own memory boards
and IDE
controllers. This &quot;standard&quot; wasn't compatible with anything else. I've never seen any of
these
cards, I didn't even find out if they were ever produced.
</P>
<P><B>Kickstart socket</B></P>
<P>
Below the floppy is room for 3 Kickstarts. Two sockets for standard Commodore ROMs
(A500/A2000)
and one is prepared for EPROMs of the series 27C512 to 27C2048. These are widely used
EPROMs
which are easily obtained.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Phoenix_open.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Phoenix_open.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P><B>Turbo boards</B></P>
<P>
You can use all turbo boards for the A500 which were mounted below the MC68000. I had an
MTEC020
and MTEC030 working without problems. Currently, I'm using a Blizzard from phase5 because
it has
the best compatibility.
</P>
<P>
This concludes the technical description. I hope to have answered all question and remain
</P>
<P>
yours
