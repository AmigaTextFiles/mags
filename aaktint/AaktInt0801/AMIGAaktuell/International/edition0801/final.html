<P><B>About AMIGA's impressive reliability (by Carsten Schr&ouml;der)</B></P>
<P>
Recently there is one point on which you can completely rely on AMIGA:
At every to some degree important fair or exhibition the company makes
new announcements, which nobody has reckoned with before, without having
former promises materialized in any way. But perhaps the latter
is the reason for again and again making new announcements: With some
positive sounding news we can try to keep the users in a good mood,
or so people in Snoqualmie seem to believe.
</P>
<P>
And furthermore we also can rely on AMIGA's communication and information
policy: anyone who was afraid that this might change can take a deep breath
and lean back comfortably. As well in the future we probably will have the
pleasure, after an announcement (which of course apriori is given
verbally and via Internet chat, but without a written press release)
of guessing how it is to be understood at all. And this
brain training is absolutely free, we do not even have to pay a penny to
AMIGA.
</P>
<P>
You certainly have already noticed, that lately I can bear the goings-on
only with humour (or is it already sarcasm?). The latest example
again is significant: When I looked on the Internet last Saturday morning,
I read user-statements like &quot;x86 version of AmigaOS in development&quot;
and &quot;AmigaOS is ported for x86 computers&quot;. Aha, offhanded, I thought AMIGA
had found its way back to rationality and realized that the decisions announced
in St. Louis were mistaken. For, as is well known, I believe that
support of the x86 processor series is an absolute necessity because of
their dominance in the market, if a small company wants to have
a chance to establish itself on the market.
</P>
<P>
Well, at least it did take (contrary to other announcements made in St. Louis
a few months ago) only a few hours until someone stated clearly, that the
announced &raquo;Amithlon&laquo; was nothing else than a substantially optimized (but in
fact not compatible for every software) Amiga emulator and not a native port
of AmigaOS 4.0 to 4.5 for x86 computers - but in my opinion exactly this
would be necessary to offer this project at least a small potential chance
to gain some share of the market.
</P>
<P>
However at least the latest news did give a small reason to hope (to me),
though: AMIGA made with Amithlon a step into the direction of x86 - perhaps
more will follow. But one thing is definite: The next Amiga fair will
come for sure ...
</P>
<P><B>With this until the next month,</B></P>
<P>
yours,
