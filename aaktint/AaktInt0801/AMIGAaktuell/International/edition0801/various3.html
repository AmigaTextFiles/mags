<H2>3. PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX (Andreas Kleinert) about development of Amithlon</H2>
<P><B>PerSuaSiVe SoftWorX (<A HREF="http://www.ar-kleinert.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.ar-kleinert.de</A>) informs:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;Even though I haven't much free time for this purpose, I will investigate the
possibility of providing x86 native plugins for my software in the Amithlon
environment.
</P>
<P>
Because in the long run diversification does not pay off - especially,
when the time is very short and considering the outdated recent Amiga
PPC platform (200 MHz without l2-cache), then this x86 development could
completely replace today's PPC support for my software. Support and testing
for PPC, PPC/MorphOS and x86 was just too much.
</P>
<P>
Basically right now less software is ordered and registered than ever
before - which leads to two considerations: Firstly, it is not profitable
any more to invest in a PPC-machine, if this will never pay off;
Secondly, if &quot;nobody&quot; else is interested in those x86 things, it is
just a personal enjoyment for the case, that my 68k/PPC Amiga at some
time simply will fall to pieces. By and by Amiga 68k/PPC software turns
to a pure hobby.
</P>
<P>
This was my 2 Cents - I'd have voted for a technically elegant
PPC architecture, but in the last 6 years this did not happen, and
now, to my opinion, it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless I sympathize with the MorphOS development and the other
PPC starts. But please remember, that I was among the very first to
support PPC on the Amiga - but make the same mistake again? No, not
this time ...&laquo;
