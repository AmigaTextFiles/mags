<H1>News about Amiga NG</H1>
<H2>1. Summary of latest Announcements by AMIGA (by Oliver Tacke)</H2>
<P>
At the Amiga Fair AmiWest in Sacramento, California,
AMIGA's CEO Bill McEwen announced several bits of news:
</P>
<P>
The AmigaOne, made by Escena (and distributed by Eyetech), is said to
be ready for shipment in quarter 4, 2001. The date aimed at is the 1st
of November, but as we all know, fixed dates must not be taken for
sure. Recently they work on the CPU cards.
</P>
<P>
Version 4.0 of the Amiga Operating System, which will run only on
the AmigaOne, is also to be distributed on November 1st. Several
items already are completed, for instance the new file-system, the new
TCP/IP stack and the 3D drivers for the Voodoo 3. More items are being
worked on, among them the RTG system and the drivers for Matrox G450 and G550.
</P>
<P>
The development presently proceeds on several Amiga 3000s and 4000s in
connection with CyberstormPPC cards, and the PCI bus board Prometheus from
Matay and StormC V4.
</P>
<P>
A surprise even for AMIGA (they had learned about it only shortly in advance
of the fair) was the availability of a new Amiga emulator for x86 systems
with the code name &quot;Amithlon&quot;. The program was developed by Harald Frank
(VMC) and Bernd Meyer (author of thr UAE JIT compiler) based upon UAE JIT.
A minimal Linux system, offering the drivers for the hardware, is used to
start off the emulation of the 68k AmigaOS. Linux is not seen in any way by
the user, so that there is the feeling of the AmigaOS directly running on
the x86 architecture, and because of this it will be distributed with the
name &quot;Amiga x86&quot;, starting in the 4th quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to statements by the developers it will be possible with Amithlon
to write x86 native routines and programs for the AmigaOS. The speed with
recent x86 processors easily outruns a 68060 processor (even without native
programs). This speed will be achieved by abandoning the emulation
of several custom chips, for instance the AGA chip set, which means
that only programs that are not dependent on those chips will run. At the
moment there is also no sound emulation. Another restriction will
be that at the most AmigaOS 3.9 will be supported, but not AmigaOS 4.x,
because that will run on PPC but not on 68k processors. No plans exist
to port this AmigaOS to x86.
</P>
<P>
Likewise in quarter 4, 2001, the AmigaDE 1.0 will be released, which
world-wide more the 30 programmers are working on and more than 300
developers are creating content for. Sharp will obtain a licence for
the Zaurus for a package with five games (moniker &quot;Series Zero&quot;).
