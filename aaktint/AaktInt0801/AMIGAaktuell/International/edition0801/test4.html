<H2>4. Hardware Review: Soundcard &raquo;Repulse&laquo; by Brent Santin</H2>
<P>
Hello. Well, I have been the owner of a Repulse Audio card for two months
now, and I thought that it was about time for someone to do a review of
this product, as it certainly deserves the attention!
</P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
The Repulse is a Zorro-II audio card by Alien Design usable in ALL
Amigas with Zorro slots. The card can play and record music in both 16 bit
and 24 bit audio. The REPULSE is AHI compatible and is advertised as having
TOCATTA emulation. Inputs and outputs are both analogue, via miniphone
stereo plugs (walkman headphone style), and optical, via TOSlink
fibre-optic connectors (as found on minidisc players, DAT machines, DVD
players, CD players and highend audio components).
</P>
<H3>Why I bought the Repulse</H3>
<P>
I am a musician with a home recording &amp; MIDI studio. I have a lot of
recordings of my own music and my friend's music I have made over the
years. I also have a large collection of out-of-print music by other
artists on vinyl and (slowly degrading) audio cassette. I wanted to be able
archive ('burn') my own music and the music in my collection onto durable
Compact Discs for safe storage and personal use. I also wanted to be able
to make CDs of my own music I create in future. My Amiga already has a
CD-burner, but I needed some way of getting high quality 16 &amp; 24 bit audio
into my Amiga so that I could manipulate it via software, and then burn it
to Compact Disc (an 8-bit parallel port sampler simply won't do the job!).
The Repulse lets me do this both optically (for truly loss-less transfers
from a digital source), and via analogue inputs. My main criterion was
quality of sound. The main goal was: get the sound from my DAT, cassette
deck, phonograph, etc. into my Amiga, edit it with Software and burn it to
CD. The Repulse allows me to get the sound into my Amiga. SOUNDFX,
SAMPLITUDE and MAKECD do the rest.
</P>
<P>
I also make use of the excellent Amiga MIDI sequencing software &quot;Bars &amp; Pipes&quot;
in my home studio. With the REPULSE card I can integrate high quality 16 bit
samples into my music, triggered by Bars &amp; Pipes.
</P>
<P>
In future I may wish to upgrade my Amiga so that I can do multitrack recording
as with ProStation Audio, or Audio Evolution. For this a 16-bit sound card is a
necessity.

<H3>Detailed description of product</H3>
<P>
The Repulse audio card comes in a small plain cardboard box. Upon opening
the box one finds the user's manual in German and English, a CD containing
software, a floppy disc for those who don't have a CD-ROM drive, and the
Repulse card itself. The card is a circuit board approximately 3.5 inches
high by five inches long. Extending from the card is a ribbon cable. At the
other end of the approximately eight inch long ribbon cable is a faceplate
with all the external inputs &amp; output jacks for the card....this faceplate
mounts on the back of the Amiga where the card backplates usually go. The
external inputs/outputs are:
</P>
1. Mic IN Analogue<BR>
2. Line IN Analogue<BR>
3. Optical IN TOSLINK<BR>
4. Optical OUT TOSLINK<BR>
5. Line OUT Analogue<BR>
6. Headphones OUT<BR>
<P>
There are also connectors on the circuit board of the Repulse card itself so
that audio from internal AMIGA devices such as a CD-ROM drive, or a TV-card can
be mixed with the Repulse's output . There are also connectors for future
expansion options, but none have been advertised yet.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Repulse.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Repulse.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="54" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<H3>Installing the Hardware</H3>
<P>
The card was easy to install. I just popped open my Amiga and put it in an
available card slot. The manual suggests putting it as far away from other
cards as possible, to avoid any RF interference, I guess. My REPULSE is
only one empty card slot away from a SUPRARAM memory card, but I have not
experienced any problems. The Repulse card sits in the part of the Zorro
slot which is furthest away from the back of the Amiga, and the ribbon
cable connects the card to the backplate with all the in-out jacks. This
ribbon cable is JUST long enough to reach the back of the Amiga. No
problems, but if it were any shorter it wouldn't make it all the way.
</P>
<P>
The manual is fairly brief on most topics, but is well written, and
the installation description is good.
</P>
<P><B>I also ran some other connectors:</B></P>
<P>
1) a mini-phone-stereo to left-and-right-RCA cable runs from the REPULSE lineout
to an input on my stereo amp, so I can listen to REPULSE sound output over my
studio monitors (speakers). (cost approx $10)
</P>
<P>
2) a 6 foot optical cable purchased from Radio Shack (these cost about $30) runs
from the optical output of my DAT machine (digital audio tape deck) to the
optical input on the REPULSE. This way I can transfer audio from the outside
world into my Amiga with absolutely no quality loss.
</P>
<P>
3) a connector (cost approximately $10) runs from the analogue audio output of
an internal CD-ROM drive to the internal input on the REPULSE card so I can play
audio CDs and this will be mixed with the REPULSE's audio output.
</P>
<P>
4) A set of headphones are plugged into the headphone jack on the REPULSE.
</P>
<H3>Installing the Software</H3>
<P>
The basic software needed to operate the REPULSE card (library, Preferences
programme &amp; AHI driver) is contained both on the CD-ROM and 3.5&quot; floppy included
with the REPULSE. The CD-ROM also contains some other bonus software I will
describe below.
</P>
<P>
Installing the critical software by Alien Design was by the means of
the standard Amiga installation programme. It was very easy and the
installation script is concise and professional. In no time at all I had
the Repulse library, preferences programme and AHI drivers installed.
</P>
<P>
I then had to configure AHI to use the REPULSE. There is not really any
documentation on how to do this in the REPULSE manual, but after perusing
the AHI AmigaGuide document I was able to figure it out, and I am a first
time user of AHI.
</P>
<P>
The Repulse Preferences programme is easy to use and is straight-forward.
It includes balance and volume faders for all the inputs &amp; outputs on the
card, as well as settings for something called 3D-audio, which is not
described in the documentation, but seems to give the audio a roomier
sound. It also has many digital S/P-DIF settings, including adding copy
protection bits &amp; pre-emphasis to digital audio output from the card, etc.
The Preferences programme seems well designed.
</P>
<P>
The CD also comes with some other software to use with the REPULSE:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> A REPULSE diagnostic programme
</LI>
<BR><LI> A Demo of AudioEvolution (Hard Disc Multitracker, Sound editor)
</LI>
<BR><LI> A version of SOUNDFX4.1 enabled for REPULSE owners.
</LI>
<BR><LI> AHIRecord (an AHI Hard-drive recorder)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Some Internet telephony programmes
</LI>
<BR><LI> Some other audio editing &amp; playing programmes, mostly available on
  Aminet (Frogger, MPEGA, AMP, etc.)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It's good that these are included, but I had problems installing this
third-party software. First of all, direct installation from the CD-ROM doesn't
work in most cases. I found the reason. Most, or all the files on the CD-ROM are
flagged as write-protected. Some installation scripts copy these protected files
to your hard drive and then try to modify the same files, but fail when they
cannot. The solution is to copy the installation archives to your Amiga's
harddrive, unprotect all the files with the PROTECT command (in CLI), and then
try installation of these programmes from the modified archives on your
harddrive.
</P>
<P>
Christoffer adds: &quot;ALL software on the CD is missing the (W)rite and (D)elete
protection bits, that includes the drivers and all AHI software. This can cause
problems configuring AHI or the drivers later on....I sent an email to
Aliendesign regarding this problem and they said that the protection bits would
be present in the next shipment of the repulse Driver CD. Therefore this problem
will only affect the first batches of the CD.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The other problem I had was with the version of SOUNDFX 4.1 included on the CD.
I was able to install it after de-protecting the files as I mentioned. The
manual says it is a specially registered version for REPULSE users, which I
suppose means it detects the presence of a REPULSE card and removes the
SHAREWARE limitations. When I use the programme, it does seem to sense the
REPULSE card in my Amiga, but it still won't let me save projects, saying I
cannot do so in the unregistered version....so what gives? Christoffer says that
he was able to install this special edition of SOUNDFX properly on his Amiga,
and suggests it may also have to do with setting the protection bits as
mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
This didn't really affect me, though, as I am already a payed-up registered user
of SOUNDFX....I just reverted to my registered copy of SOUNDFX4.1 and it works
fine with the REPULSE. I highly recommend this programme for Amiga Audio
enthusiasts....it is very powerful. The only other audio manipulation programme
that I am aware of that uses virtual memory (needed for manipulating large audio
files on Amigas with limited memory) is Samplitude. So if you plan on
manipulating 16-bit stereo songs of normal length (3 minutes or more) and you
have less than 50MB of RAM....I would suggest using one of these programmes.
</P>
<H3>Slight Problems</H3>
<P>
The REPULSE has been working fine for me for the past two months. There is only
one slight annoyance I have experienced. Upon FIRST cold-booting my Amiga, the
Repulse is never recognised. I have to do a warm-reboot (CTRL-A-A) and then
AFTER that the REPULSE is recognised by the Amiga and its software. I'm not sure
why this is, but it sounds like an easy to solve problem. The REPULSE always
works fine after that first re-boot and any subsequent warm-reboots. There is a
small programme on the Alien-Design web site (www.aliendesign-gbr.de) which is
supposed to activate the REPULSE library early in the startup-sequence. I
installed it but it doesn't seem to change things. Frankly, I haven't really
tried very hard to fix this problem yet.
</P>
<P>
Christoffer suggests: &quot;For more information on this matter refer to Aliendesigns
Repulse FAQ at: <A HREF="http://www.aliendesign-gbr.de/repulse/en/text_faq.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.aliendesign-gbr.de/repulse/en/text_faq.html</A>. It has
been updated to deal with the issue regarding initializing the card after a
cold-boot and also describes the usage of the repulseinit utility.&quot;
</P>
<H3>Using the Repulse</H3>
<P>
So far I've used the Repulse to play audio via AHI, mp3 players, sound editing
programmes, multimedia players, and played audio CDs in my CD-ROM drive via the
REPULSE. It's always sounded great with no noticeable hiss or added noise.
</P>
<P>
I've also transferred music from several DATs and analogue audio cassettes into
my Amiga using the REPULSE, which I have subsequently burned to CD. I have
mostly used the software &quot;AHIRecord&quot; to do this (comes with the Repulse), and
again, the results have been fantastic....excellent audio quality. So the
REPULSE really does exactly what I wanted it to do.
</P>
<P>
Christoffer and another Repulse owner I've been e-mailing describe an
two easy methods to mix the Amiga's Paula audio with the REPULSE's
output. Thereby all Amiga audio (AHI and native) would be output via the
REPULSE:
</P>
<P>
(Christoffer) &quot;A tip is to connect your Amiga's audio output via an 2x RCA --&gt;
1x Mini-Stereo connector cable to your repulse's analogue input. Then adjust the
mixer settings so that the Line IN signal is at acceptable volume, save your
settings and invoke the commmand repulse init with the option to stay memory
resident in your user-startup, this will allow you to (after the repulse-init
command has been issued) play all your favourite games and re-reoute the Amiga's
internal audio via the repulse - very nice :)&quot;
</P>
<P>
The other way suggested to me involves the same approach with an internal twist.
Instead of going from the Amiga's RCA outputs to the REPULSE's analogue line-in
(on the back of the REPULSE), the cable should go to one of the REPULSE's
internal inputs (i.e. The CD-ROM-Audio input, or the TV-card input, on the
circuit board of the REPULSE itself). This way all the external inputs of the
REPULSE are still available. This would involve is the purchase of an internal
CD-ROM Audio cable ($6) and two male RCA jacks ($5). Just snip-off one end of
the CD-ROM Audio cable and solder on the RCA jacks (connect one to the left
channel wire, one to the right audio wire and both to the ground wire). You
would have to remove one of the dummy-card backplates, or drill a small hole in
the metal casing at the back of your Amiga so the cable can go from the external
RCA jacks of the Amiga to the internal connector of the REPULSE.
</P>
<P>
Christoffer also suggests when using the REPULSE: &quot;Another hint to make the card
sound as good as possible, is to always disable the inputs that you're not
using, especially the Mic input. Since hey all add to the overall noice level of
the card when active.&quot;
</P>
<P>
I should add that analogue inputs do not add any noise to the optical
input, as they are not mixed with it.
</P>
<H3>Cost of the REPULSE</H3>
<P>
Well...here it comes down to dollars. Amiga hardware is never as cheap as
PC or MAC hardware, is it? And seeing as there weren't really any competing
products at the time the REPULSE was released, I couldn't really do any
competitive shopping, so I had to live with the price. I ordered the
REPULSE from Software Hut in the USA (www.softhut.com). The cost was
$299.00 U.S. Plus shipping. I also had to pay for cross-border customs fees
to Canada, and Canadian G.S.T. (tax). The total cost, including ridiculous
taxes, customs fees and shipping, probably came to near six-hundred
Canadian dollars when all was said and done. Pretty expensive for a sound
card, eh? Well, yes and no. Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> Why not buy an Amiga PC-card slot expansion board such as the
Mediator, and then have access to the wide world of PC-compatible
sound cards instead of buying an Amiga-only sound card.
</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> There has been some doubt as to whether this approach is technically
feasible (I asked the designers at Alien Design about this). I wanted to be sure
the hardware I bought could carry out the job I needed it to do, so I bought
Amiga dedicated hardware. Besides, a Mediator is another added expense, and
won't even work for users with an A2000. Where are the drivers for Audio cards
via a Mediator? Lastly, see my comment about those &quot;affordable&quot; PC soundcards
below.
</P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> PC sound cards cost as little as $40!! The Repulse seems
so expensive compared to this!
</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> Most standard PC soundcards are designed for video games.
They have MPEG decoding and fancy 3D features built in, but for simple,
professional audio purposes they often perform poorly. If you don't believe
me just do a YAHOO or USENET search for the words SOUNDBLASTER NOISE
PROBLEM and see just how many hits you get. This type of noise and signal
degradation usually goes unnoticed by game-players, but is unacceptable for
someone doing professional audio. The other point to note is that many of
these audio cards have no optical inputs, or if they do, only an optical
output. This is not satisfactory for my intended use. There is a web page
out there dedicated to showing how even the digital optical in on the
&quot;higher-end&quot; Soundblaster cards add unwanted noise. I think you will find
that even those people in the WINDOWS-PC world who use their computers for
pro-audio will spend approximately $300 or more on a good sound card (I'm
NOT talking about any brand you can buy at Computer City or a similar
retailer). Lastly, very few cards under $300 on any computer offer 24-bit
audio compatibility, which is quickly becoming the standard in professional
audio circles.
</P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> If you want to burn CDs of your music, why didn't you just
buy a stand-alone stereo CD-burner?
</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> Well, these cost just as much or more as the REPULSE plus
a CD-RW drive. And they don't let me edit or adjust the audio beforehand as
I can with a computer. Also, the home-consumer level CD-recordable decks
use special AUDIO only CD-Rs that cost three times the price of normal
CD-Rs and are harder to find. I suppose I could get a professional CD-R
recorder by TASCAM or such, but those cost $900 or more here in Canada, and
again, have very limited editing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B> O.k. Then, well what about a Minidisc recorder?
</P>
<P>
<B>Answer:</B> I like the Minidisc format very much, but I want to have the wide
compatibility and the uncompressed audio features of CD for storing my master
recordings. I may get a MD machine in future for portable use.
</P>
<P>
So, yes, it was expensive. But $299 U.S. For a piece of studio equipment is
really quite an average price. So for anyone using his or her Amiga for
professional audio it is a reasonable price. Plus, after I listened to that
first CD of my own music transferred from an old analogue cassette, I had
no regrets at all. Entirely worth it for the peace of mind it gives (in
reference to the stability and longevity of CD as an archival medium).
</P>
<P>
I should mention that the REPULSE is advertised as costing 200 Euro by
Alien Design (which is about 200-250 US dollars). Some European Repulse
owners have been able to purchase it for this price.
</P>
<H3>Some other Words</H3>
<P>
I just have a few more things to say regarding the REPULSE. Firstly, when
the REPULSE first came out, there were some weird words about it published
by KDH-Datatechnik(sp?) in Germany regarding some alleged quality control
problems by Alien-Design. For some reason KDH could not get their initial
order of REPULSE cards and so were in dispute with Alien Design because of
this (they are now offering the Flipper, instead). After a search on the
Internet, I could locate no firm evidence about any quality control
problems at Alien Design, if there were any. No bad cards seem to have made
it out into public distribution. In fact, several European owners of the
REPULSE posted messages on the KDH site stating how satisfied they were
with their REPULSE cards.
</P>
<P>
Addendum: The REPULSE FAQ on the Alien Design web site addresses this
rumour. It seems the factory making the REPULSE cards was at first
providing Alien Design with batches in which there was a higher than
expected faulty card rate (some fault rate is always expected in any
circuit board production). Alien Design tests each REPULSE in a real Amiga,
so no faulty cards are shipped out to the public. Only perfectly
functioning REPULSEs make it out into distribution. This higher than
expected fault rate on the first batch made it impossible for Alien Design
to meet all retailer orders....the shortage was reported on KDH's web-site
and was misinterpreted by some as meaning the REPULSE was unreliable. I
think the experience demonstrated myself and other REPULSE owners shows the
REPULSE to be a totally reliable product.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a message for Alien-Design: I really wish you would let more Amiga
users know about this great product you have offered. It really fills a badly
needed void. I am surprised to see almost no publicity about the Repulse! I am
sure many Amiga users do not even know it exists, so please advertise!
</P>
<H3>Notes on competition</H3>
<P>
There doesn't seem to be very many Amiga Audio cards still in production. The
only other options for Amiga users are used audio cards (very hard to find), or
the Delphina Flipper which will be released in August 2001. Now, the Flipper
seems like a good product. It is an improved version of an older product. But
how does it compare with the Repulse? Well, it seems that it will be selling for
about the same amount of money. Will it be Zorro II or Zorro III? Well, if it is
Zorro III then A4000, 3000 and 1200 users will benefit from the advantages of Z3
architecture, but A2000 users will be unable to use it. The Repulse is usable in
all Amigas. Also, from what I've seen the Delphina doesn't have 24-bit
capability, nor does it have optical inputs &amp; outputs, which are really a must
for people doing professional Audio. The Flipper will have a DSP (digitial
signal processor), which will be helpful for adding special effects to game
music, or decoding mp3's, or surround sound. The Flipper's DSP may also be good
for adding realtime effects to multitrack audio via ProStation Audio or Audio
Evolution. But for mixing and mastering pro-audio, a DSP is not be as important
as the quality of sound offered by the REPULSE's optical-jacks and 24-bit audio.
Also, the Alien Design REPULSE FAQ mentions that a DSP and MP3 decoder are
possibilities for a future REPULSE expansion module, so REPULSE owners may get
the best of both worlds one day. The Flipper seems like a good general audio
product, but based on the specifications I've seen, people interested in
pro-audio (like home music studio owners, or audiophiles) might find the Repulse
more useful due to the unique features I've mentioned. Funny thing: the Flipper
is advertised in a much better fashion than the Repulse. I haven't seen any
Repulse advertisements at all.
</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
Well, I hope that answers your questions about the Repulse. A great product
that will get sound into and out of your Amiga with excellent quality. The
power of your Amiga and available RAM will determine how fast you can deal
with the sound once it's on your hard drive. I recommend this product.
