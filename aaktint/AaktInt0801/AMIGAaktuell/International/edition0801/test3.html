<H2>3. Hardware Test: PCI Busboard &raquo;Prometheus&laquo; (by Joachim Schmid)</H2>
<P>
After a long wait full of hope for an A4000T PCI board it finally caught fire!
</P>
<P>
Matay is first to market with a PCI board for ZorroIII. Oh, man!
How long have I had to look grudgingly on A1200 users who have PCI boards
in their computers - G-Rex from DCE, Mediator from Elbox, and even the Predator,
so far stuck in the announcements. None of them work in a ZorroIII port.
And suddenly here's a company with the name of Matay, producing a PCI
board for all Amigas.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprises had announced, but not delivered,  a PCI board for the A4000T.
And when Elbox indicated that they would not support the
Warp3D driver from Hyperion, my choice narrowed to the Prometheus
from Matay.
</P>
<P>
I straight away went to KDH Datentechnik and bought a Prometheus board
with Voodoo3 from G&uuml;nter Horbach. At home I had a closer look at the case
and I must say that this was the very best looking packaging
I ever had seen for an Amiga hardware extension. The cover is colourful
and professionally done, it could be put on a computer shop rack without
need to hide behind other articles.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Prometheus1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Prometheus1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="74" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
After opening the package this first impression was confirmed. Inside I
found the Prometheus board with fasteners and necessary screws,
a feed cable for the additional power-supply, an extension cord for
a graphics board and a colour manual, in English, German and
Polish, with detailed advice and pictures describing
installation of the board. And right at the bottom of the box was a CD-ROM,
containing the driver for the Prometheus board and P96 for the Voodoo3
board, and several demo programs such as Shogo, HereticII and
Wipeout2097.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Prometheus2.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Prometheus2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<H3>The Installation:</H3>
<P>
The most difficult thing in the installation was securing
the two clamps that hold the Prometheus. But thanks to extensive
installation information this was mastered quite quickly.
</P>
<P>
But be careful!!! Electronic components can be destroyed by static electricity!
Touch a grounded point, for instance a
radiator or a blank part of the computer housing, with your hand to
discharge your static. And only hold the Prometheus by the edges,
at places where no components are located to be on the safe side.
Of course this equally applies to the handling of the Voodoo3 board.
</P>
<P>
After both the angular metal supports are fastened with three screws,
the Voodoo3 board can be set into any one of the four PCI slots and be
fixed with another screw at the support. Now the Prometheus is ready
to be put into one of the ZorroIII slots of the tower. But be careful,
clearance is tight above. Now just fit the additional power cable and
the graphics board extension and the mechanical installation is done.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Prometheus3.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Prometheus3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<H3>Installation of software:</H3>
<P>
Installation of the drivers is simple, kids' stuff.
</P>
<P>
But first the old graphics board driver has to be deleted from the
system, in my case CyberGraphX V4, otherwise it can lead to a system
crash. Unfortunately the old graphics board has to go as well, because
it has a negative influence on the speed of the new Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
Having done this, you are nearly done. You just have to start
the installation script in the Prometheus directory on the CD and
all necessary files are copied to their directories. The board is
recognized immediately after a reboot. Quickly install the graphics
board driver P96 and you can start enjoying the Voodoo3 board.
</P>
<P>
It is known that there are problems with the original A4000T,
because that system does not recognize a Voodoo3
board. But I have an A4000D converted to an A4000T, I
did not have any troubles and the Voodoo3 board has run just fine
for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
If you are lucky and have an A4000T conversion, you better have
internet access, for now it is very important to download from the homepage
of Matay, www.Matay.pl, the recent driver updates as well as the Warp3D
driver and to install them. (If there are problems with the connection,
try it between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock, because then the connection is
best).
</P>
<P>
Be sure to have the latest WarpUp (V5.0) available, and when during
installation you are asked for the graphics board, set it
to &quot;Other Graphics Board&quot; [or similar]. After the Warp3D driver is
installed, you just have to find out the video-memory address with the
provided program &quot;PrmScan&quot; and to copy it into the directory PowerPC.
This is done like this: start &quot;PrmScan&quot; in the CLI
and the following data will be shown:
</P>
<PRE>
VENDOR: 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC
DEVICE: VOODOO3 ALL VOODOO3 CHIPS, 3000
REVISION: 1.
DEVICE CLASS 03,SUBCLASS 00.
ADDRESS RANGE: 5E000000 - 5FFFFFFF.
ADDRESS RANGE: 5C000000 - 5DFFFFFF.
ADDRESS RANGE: 400EFF00 - 400EFFFF.
64KB OF ROM AT 5BFF0000 - 5BFFFFFF.
</PRE>
<P>
You now use the second address in the first column, i.e. here 5C000000,
to type the command &quot;setenv PowerPC/Gfxaddr $5C000000&quot; and additionally
copy this Gfxaddr to the directory &quot;Prefs/ENV-Archive/PowerPC&quot; of the
Workbench.
</P>
<P>
Now you are ready to experience the new Voodoo3 in full power and
splendour.
</P>
<H3>Speed Tests and Overall Impression of the Board:</H3>
<P>
According to manufacturer's specs by Matay the Prometheus manages a
data transfer of appr. 120 MB/sec from PCI slot to PCI slot and a
transfer of appr. 12 MB/sec from PCI via ZorroIII to CPU. I couldn't check
this directly, but these statements seemed to be quite
realistic.
</P>
<P>
But now to the most important aspect of the speed, the
2D/3D tests. For this I used the following configuration: A4000T
604e/233/060/66 with 128 MB Ram, OS3.9 and a Voodoo3 3000 PCI board.
For the test I ran &quot;P96-speed&quot;, which is on the CD-ROM.

<P>
All those tests were performed at a resolution of 640x480x8 and you can
see that the Voodoo3 partly is 3 to 4 times faster than the CVPPC
and up to 7 times faster than the PICASSO IV, not to mention AGA.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the CVPPC is the winner, but you have to
realize that the CVPPC can use the direct connection port on the
CyberStormPPC, whereas the Voodoo3 only uses the slower ZorroIII port.
</P>
<P>
And these little victories disappear in the 3D test!
</P>
<P><B>The 3D Test:</B></P>
<P>
The 3D test was performed with the &quot;Timerefresh&quot; command
during the game HereticII at the beginning of the first level. The
numbers given are the frames per second (FPS).
</P>
<PRE>
HereticII: 640*480*16 : 800*600*16 : 1024*768*16 :
         :            :            :             :
Voodoo3  :         28 :         22 :          14 :
CVPPC    :         16 :         11 :           2 :
</PRE>
<P>
That's that! This should make it clear who the boss is here! The CVPPC
at a resolution of 800*600 is only half as fast as the Voodoo3 and at
1024*768 only as fast as a snail.
</P>
<P>
But this is not all that the Voodoo3 offers. Anyone who has played
HereticII with a CVPPC will not recognise it with the Voodoo3, because
lots of additional effects can be seen and the
light effects are pure madness! Really!
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Prometheus4.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Prometheus4.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Another improvement is that the picture is displayed by the Voodoo3
quite a bit sharper and clearer than with the CVPPC. And as well the
vertical video frequency of the Voodoo3 can't be beat. At a
resolution of 640*480*24 a frequency of 160 Hz can be achieved, the
same applies at 800*600*24, and even at 1600*1200*24 100 Hz can be
displayed, of course only, if your monitor can keep up! In
addition to that it is possible to display graphics modi in 32 bit
(meaning 4,295 milliards [US: billions] of colours!). Not that I know
where this many colours are needed, but the game QuakeIII uses this
modus.
</P>
<H3>Net Result:</H3>
<P>
My mantra is: Permedia2 no chance!
See a Voodoo3 board in action just once, and you will pass up the chance to
try the competition. The performance in nearly every respect is many
times higher than the current leader CVPPC, especially in 3D. There
are nearly no negative features and my board has run in my computer
for weeks without a single crash. OK, there are one
or more bugs in the Warp3D driver, but they will, according to a
statement by Hyperion, be eliminated as far as possible with version
4.2 and the speed again will be increased (can't believe that!!).
</P>
<P>
On the question of drivers from Matay, it is too early to expect a long
list. Presently there are only the drivers for the Voodoo3 2000/3000
and the Warp3D driver from Hyperion. Word has it that before long
a 2D driver for the Voodoo4 4500 and drivers for the NE200 network board
will be available, and this will only be the beginning.
</P>
<P>
But don't rush out and buy a Voodoo5 5500 right now, because
Hans-Joerg Frieden of Hyperion told me that there may
not be any Warp3D drivers for this board! The reason: 3Dfx has been
bought out by Nvidia and they are not releasing the spec of the VSA-100
graphics chip. What a shame!
</P>
<P>
Rumors persist of plans for a G3 CPU board, but this also is a fond hope
for the future.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the picture is brillant, the performance is super, and the drivers work
crash-proof! So, what can keep you away from this hardware?
</P>
<P><B>Of course ................the price!</B></P>
<P>
Well, 598 DM (at Vesalia 559 DM) [306 and 286 EURO] and more than 200 DM
[102 EURO] for the Voodoo3 is a healthy wad of money, and not every user
carries that sort of stash in the pocket. But quality has its price and
Matay has made the effort to deliver a product that will satisfy
any customer. If you've got the money and want to lift the performance of
your Amiga to new dimensions, you should absolutely
buy this PCI board and a Voodoo3.
</P>
<P>
I just hope that Matay sell enough of these PCI boards to be enable them to
provide the Amiga with even more new hardware in the future.
