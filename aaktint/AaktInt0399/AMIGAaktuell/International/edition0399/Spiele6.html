<H2>6. Review: Zombie Massacre</H2>
<P>
Zombie Massacre by Alpha Software is sold in the well-known CD-case, which
really contains a CD-ROM (!). The CD-ROM is filled to 1/3, but the
game itself doesn't need much space. The CD-case makes you want to play
the game, because texts like "It's a brilliant game and I suggest you get
it pretty soon. 96%" and the features don't sound bad. But a printed
manual could not be found, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
Now comes the first 'highlight' of the game: The Installation! When I started
the installation for the first time it ended with a total crash, what makes
me beleieve that the Eagleplayer ran at that time. In the second try I could
watch a nicely flickering scroll text (in the installer!). In addition to
that a second program started, that also scrolled text in its window. After
a short delay there also played music... Then some files were copied (not
more than 100 KB). Unfortunately the devices and libraries are just copied
into the desired directories without checking the version numbers. This
could cause problems with some Kickstarts! After the installation you find
yourself in the AmigaGuide manual: So let's talk about the story...
</P>
<P>
As the title already tells you, it's about Zombies, which were created in
biochemical experiments and fled some day in 2009 and terrorize the
neighbourhood. Due to the experiments the Zombies got more powers and
a longer life span. Most of them are a mixture of human, animal and plant.
You and your equipment have to destroy these 'beasts'. The original story
is quite longer, I just mentioned the most important details.
</P>
<P>
Now to the FMV (Full Motion Video) squences, which are on the CD-ROM in
great numbers and had been a hit on Halloween. Filmed in best black and white
quality you watch Gareth Murfin (main author of the game) and some of his
friends as Zombies walking through the house and the garden. With some
sound effects added it's a real laugh. Of course, these 'Zombies' are being
killed and this really looks professional! Well, believe it or not, there
are outtakes as well as a real story board for the zombie clips on this
CD-ROM...
</P>
<P>
Okay, but now we start the game itself: The complete game 'Zombie Massacre'
is based on the old Gloom Deluxe 3D engine, which some of you might know
from 1996. Clearly spoken this means, that just the graphics have been
altered. It is said, that it is faster now, but you might notice that only
on an NTSC monitor. On PAL systems the game is 3% faster as they tell you.
But that isn't noticed. Who knows Gloom Deluxe, knows that it isn't a new
3D game at all. En contraire: The opponents are all in 2D and stairs, water
or other goodies are missed. Also the graphics don't make you fall over
backwards, even if they are middle class. The rest of the features Gloom
Deluxe had are present: Two player mode, network mode, various blood options
and so on.
</P>
<P>
So, but now to some extras on the CD: Here you find a lot of software by
Alpha Soft, which is mostly also present in Aminet. There's nothing
brilliant just little programs. For some might be an interesting one
among them.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Re evaluation of this game is quite difficult for me, because
Alpha Software seems to have gone to great trouble. But unfortunately
the oldfashioned Gloom Deluxe engine was altered just a little and a
game like Zombie Massacre isn't state of the art in 1999. Even on the
Amiga there is more, which is possible. Much of it doesn't realy fit.
The FMV sequences show houses and gardens, in the game you play in
dungeons. And you don't shoot with a shotgun as in the video, but with
fireballs... Well, there is too much of Gloom instead introducing new
things into the game. The could have made a hit of this game, but not
with this engine. So I don't have a chance, but to present you the
not so good evaluation:

Epilogue:
The fun is really over, because it is the fourth (!) game with nearly
identical engine. After some time this doesn't make any fun at all.
In addition you should watch out: On the back cover you can read:
"It's a brilliant game and I suggest you get it pretty soon. 96% Neil
Bullock (World of Amiga)" This statement is for Gloom 3 !!! So they try
to cheat the people. Of course, this lowers the final evaluation!
By the way, the often mentioned FMV sequences are no jokes, but the authors mean
it seriously. Unfortunately they are so amateur like, they are really 'just'
a laugh.
