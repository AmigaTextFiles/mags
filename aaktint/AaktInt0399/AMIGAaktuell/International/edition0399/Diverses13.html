<H3>13. VaporWare announces X-Arc 1.3</H3>
<P>
&raquo;X-Arc is an archive management program for the Amiga, designed in a
similar fashion to WinZip(r) on Windows(r) systems and Stuff-It(r) for
MacOS(r).
</P>
<P>
X-Arc is somewhat different from previously released archive management
tools: those programs provided no more than a graphical interface on top of
existing archiver commands, often in a incomplete and inflexible way.
</P>
<P>
X-Arc offers the user an extremely intuitive interface for the more often
performed operations, whilst complimenting this with a range of advanced
options suitable for the expert user.
</P>
<P>
X-Arc provides the user with a brand new and sophisticated way to add files
to an archive, mixing speed and power never seen in any similar program on
any operating system.
</P>
<P>
X-Arc is based on a modular concept, allowing any third party to develop
modules to handle new archive formats without having to alter the main
program.
</P>
<P>
X-Arc offers the ability to perform many operations, using drag , from
within the main program or with standard Workbench icons (ie. drag files
from your Workbench screen to X-Arc's lister window). X-Arc also supports
drag with Scalos based lister windows.

matter of seconds, with its installer support.
