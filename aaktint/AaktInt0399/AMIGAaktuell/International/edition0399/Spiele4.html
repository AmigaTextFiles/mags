<H2>4. Games news from all over the world</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Titan Computer cancells Total Combustion and SOTTM 2
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The rumours of the last months were confirmed oficially by Titan Computer.
Due  to the excessive pirate copying these two projects have failed. The
developers don't see any reasonable base to continue their projects.
This means, that means, that only Settlers 2 and Claws of the Devil are
under development. It is to hope, that these projects are not being
cancelled due to pirate copying. So folks, keep your fingers off from
pirate copies!

<LI> clickBOOM rumours
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Early this month a text of a so called ex-clickBOOM member, which
ported Myst to the Amiga, appeared. He claims, that clickBOOM doesn't
exist since a whole of a year, but just Alexander Petrovic and that he
was no Amiga fan, but just wants the money. He would leave the Amiga
as quick as possible, when he had enough money. In addition clickBOOMs
payment habit was bad as the promises. clickBOOM went into legal steps
against the author and made clear, that all claims were not true. It was
also claimed, that Capital Punishment would include an illegal LHA keyfile
and the games were developped using a pirate copy of StormC. But the rumour
of the bad paying habits seems to have a true core. Recently I talked
to a programmer, who parted Quake for clickBOOM. He also developped some
updates for Quake, but is not allowed to publish them. Who wants the original
text (50 KB) regarding the claims, should ask me.

</UL>
<P>
Apart from the rumours there are some news of clickBOOM: Napalm has been
published, at last! In this edition you find two tests of the game, which
reached me in the last minute. In addition it seems, that Trauma Zero
will be published by clickBOOM, because a game named 'T-Zero' is advertised
in the booklet of Napalm with the text 'A shoot-em up to end all shoot-em-up`s'.
According to clickBOOMs speaker Sofia Tsiotsikas there will be some ports
of PC games as well as some brand new Amiga games. The quality shall stay
on clickBOOMs niveau.

George Hornmoen got all additional files of the Command &amp; Conquer
clone Maim &amp; Mangle to The World Foundry. There they will continue
developing the hardly awaited game. Maim &amp; Mangle will be completely
in 3D, that means, there will be a completely new feeling of gameplay.

multiplayer suport. Maim &amp; Mange needs an 68040, 8 MB RAM. Supports
and recommended are graphics bard and a PowerPC.

<LI> There are still programmers wanted for NEX
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The team of Marco Siegel works currently on NEX - The Dark Age.
The game will become like Bladerunner, but in 3D. So it sounds quite
interesting. The 3D engine of NEX is to be revolutionary, so there is
MIP mapping, texture filtering, coloured lights, Lambert shading, polygon
enemies and weapons. The game supports the usage of Warp3D and Virge as
well as Permedia2. You should a least own an 68040 and, if possible,
a graphics board. Logically, that the PowerPC is also supported. For the
completion of the project C-programmers are being searched, so quickly
contact Marco Siegel &lt;<A HREF="mailto:marco.siegel@hal.regiocom.net">marco.siegel@hal.regiocom.net</A>&gt;, to
let this game come true!

The long awaited adventure Gilbert Goodmate is to be released in Amiga
PC versions in July 1999. Some of the features are more than 45 by a
Disney graphic designer hand drawn locations, more than 50 characters for
communications, in a studio produced CD audio tracks, high resolutions
are completely supported and more. Dark Millenia, which will be published
in December seems to be shortly before its release. Dark Millenia is
a game in the style of Cammand &amp: Conquer, but it is a phantasy world.
Some of the features are 256 colour graphics, Pseudo 3D perspective,
all objects nicely animated, different weather like rain and snow,
CD music and much more. Of course, Dark Soul is a role game, which runs
only on PPC and graphics board. Sound cards are also supported. There aren't
many known details, but it is certain, that all the dungeons are computed
on random, so you don't play a level twice. Mage Wars is published only by
Crystal Software, see upper on this page for infos of this game.
Abducted is under development from Aftertaste Productions and it is
ad adventure in the style of Monkey Island. It requires AGA and offers
256 colour graphics. In addition there are HAM8 3D sequences as well as
16bit sound. But the development of Tanks Goblins was cancelled.
