<H3>7. CDCat 3.0 with PowerPC support and new functions</H3>
<H4>&raquo;CDCat Release 3:</H4>
<P>
CDCat, the powerful and easy to use CD-ROM catalogizer, that uses MUI,
is now available in a new version, CDCat Release 3 (v3.0), after a long
period of development.
</P>
<P>
During the development many time was invested to consider the users wishes
for more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
So the users get an optimum of control about the scan catalogues with the
catalogue manager, in the Release 3 of CDCat. CDCat 3 is now able to search
directories. To make complete use of the computing power, CDCat Release 3
now offers PowerPC search routines, but the routines for the MC680x0 still
can be used, of course.
</P>
<P>
Also old catalogues and config files can be used with the new release.
</P>
<H4>Some features of CDCat are:</H4>
<UL>
<LI> able to catalogize complete CDs, hard disks and PD disks
</LI>
<LI> superfast Aminet mode, that scanns Aminet CDs within a few seconds and
     considers age, size and description
</LI>
<LI> quick and flexible search function (PowerPC; 68k: 85% inline assembler!!)
</LI>
<LI> Direct searching (without scan catalogue) of disks or directories possible.
     So you can find easily lost files on your hard disk.
</LI>
<LI> Browser function, which shows the directories' contents of a CD like
     like a directory utility, that also shows the mentioned Aminet extensions,
     so you don't have to read all the index guides of the Aminet CDs.
<P>
    =&gt; Rummage the CDs for a file without having the desired CD in the CD-ROM!!!
</P>
</LI>
<LI> 15 freely configureable user buttons, so you can unarchive, show pictures,
     play music modules etc. directly from CDCat.
</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Some features new with Release 3:</H4>
<UL>
<LI> PowerPC plug-in to speed up the search (The old routines still work, of course!)
</LI>
<LI> Catalogue manager to rearrange catalogue contents. Individual disk can
     be erased or copied into other catalogues etc.
</LI>
<LI> Now it is possible to search directories.
</LI>
<LI> Filter functions for the result of the search (available using the menu)
</LI>
<LI> Progress display, if commands are being executed using the user buttons
</LI>
<LI> Possibility to start programs in anychrone mode. Now you no longer need
     to execute a program with &quot;run&quot;, which resulted in problems with
     the Shell output window.
</LI>
<LI> The results of the search are displayed using the MUI class NLIS (by Gilles Masson),
     so the list has e.g. a horizontal scroller, now.
</LI>
<LI> various bugfixes
</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Registering:</H4>
<P>
The register fee is about 40.00 DM resp. 20.00 Euros. Then the users get
a keyfile to get use to all the functions without limitations.
</P>
<H4>Upgrades:</H4>
<P>
I invested very much work in this release, but because it is most unlikely that the
number of Amiga users has grown, I also need the support of the already registered
users of CDCat Relase 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
The common register fee was risen to 40.00 DM resp. 20.00 Euros, registered users of CDCat
Release 1 and 2 can get their upgrade for 20.00 DM resp. 10.00 Euros.
</P>
<P>
Users, who registered after November 1, 1998 get their update for 15.00 DM resp. 7.50 Euros.
</P>
<P>
A test of the revision v1.2 is in the (German) AmigaPlus 12/97, a test of
v2.2 in the AmigaPlus 9/98.
</P>
<P>
