<H2>7. Review: Napalm</H2>
<P>
This year, February 23 was the day: In my letterbox I found a package
just arrived from Canada and what was in it? Correct, Napalm. Napalm is
deliverd as usual in a CD-case with CD-ROM, which are both in a professional
design. The manual is in the CD-case as a booklet and is completely in
English. The installation is done without any problem using the installer
by Commodore. Now you just have to configure Napalm, which is also done
using the installer by Commodore. But more about that, later.
</P>
<P>
The story is short and simple: It is about a war in the near future,
where robots try to destroy mankind.
</P>
<P>
In the setup there are various options like e.g. resolution, sound settings,
CD music settings, network settings and more. AHI and TCP/IP aren't supported
yet, there you will read a notice about the clickBOOM homepage. Now, just
save the settings and go!
</P>
<P>
After a short intro, which was made with impressing graphics you
find yourself in the main menu, where you can start your new war or
load an old one. In addition you can configure your network. The actions
are with CD music as well as voice output. Now you have to decide whether
you are a robot that fights mankind or if you are a human who fights the
robots. After that you get some informations about the next mission and
then you are in the game, which screenmode can be defined. On AGA computers
you should use LowRes. Then everything is quite big, but at least continously.
Owners of graphics boards can use better settings.
</P>
<P>
In the game you can lead your units, soldiers and vehicles in any direction.
If you reach an undiscovered area, this becomes visible. The graphics and
animations were made with many details and are really impressive.
In graphics Napalm could compete with any PC strategy game. The sounds
and their quality are also convincing, because there are sound fx and
CD music with 20 tracks all together. A quite high fun completes it.
You might just miss the intelligence of the opponents and other terrains
as e.g. water or desert. Internet compatibility would be nice, too, but
it is under development. The controls could have been improved, too.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Napalm can keep its promisses. The graphics are very impressive,
the sounds and the CD music complete the atmospere and the fun playing
the game is absolutely high, except some not so important things. Because
Napalm supports the Locale system by Commodore you won't have to wait
too long for translations. TCP/IP and AHI support are under development,
what more do you want?
In short: Napalm is a hit!
