<H3>1. Supplemental: CD-R and CD-RW connected to the Amiga (by Uwe Pannecke)</H3>
<P>
&raquo;Compatibility writer and CD-R media
</P>
<P>
In the desire test report of Amiga aktuell international 02/99 you could read:
&quot;There were used branded as well as noname CD-R and CD-RW. The normal price
for the media was around 3.00 DEM (approx. 1.53 Euro) for a CD-R and 10.00 DEM
(approx. 5.10 Euro) for a CD-RW. All media could be written without errors.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The last sentence has to be corrected. Meanwhile there were more branded
CD-Rs, which were tested. There we found out, that the Ricoh writer would
not cooperate with CD-Rs of the brand &quot;Maxell&quot;. Even recognized
as CD-R and written with the laser beam an error message of the
Ricoh MP6200S popped up, after a short time and different amounts of
data written. It meant, that the CD-Rs had physical errors and the writing
process could not be continued.
Result: CD-R &quot;trashed&quot;, 3.00 DEM went up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
Because this problem occured with each of the three present Maxell media
an incompatibility of the Ricoh MP6200S - Maxell is very likely. If the
writer or the CD-R are responsible has to be unsolved for the moment.
The desired media were labelled &quot;Maxell CD-R 74 H&quot;
and &quot;Maxell CD-R 74 XL&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Generally you should be careful with brands you did not use before and test
the compatibility with one CD-R, else a bargain 10-disk-pack can become
expensive...

The Ricoh MP6200S had no problems with
