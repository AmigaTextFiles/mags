<H2>9. Review: Imperator - Master of Rome</H2>
<P>
The surprisingly published game Imperator - Master of Rome is delivered in
the well-known CD case with 2 floppy disks. A manual of a half page is
also included in the case. The installation is easily done with the
installer of Commodore.
</P>
<P>
The players mission is to expand the empire and to drive back enemy attacks
as a roman tribune as well as to become emperor. The game is divided into
two parts: 60% are the strategy and 40% are battle.
</P>
<P>
After starting the game, which was developped in AMOS Pro, the logos of
the distributor Epic Marketing and the publisher, Islona Entertainment,
are shown. After that you are informed about the developer team. Now you
can select the number of players, the maximum is 3 and some other options
like name, speed, scrolling and so on. After that you are asked, if you would
 like to watcj the intro. This is of a picture and some lines of scrolling text.
</P>
<P>
Now you are in the game, excactely on the map, where you can make your moves.
The games principle is similar to the one of the Amiga classic 'Centurion',
which some of you might still know. The fun is similar with both games,
but the graphics of Imperator is worse (!!), even it was released nearly a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion is a game, which might have become a hit 8 years ago.
As most of the currently released games, Imperator is not state of the art,
even if the fun isn't bad. The 16 colour graphics are to forget. Even
the highly recommended graphics in the style of Asterix don't convice.
The game itself is completely German, even if the manual is Enlish (?).
The sounds are fine, sometimes they are quite funny. I think, that
this game would not have missed the 80% hurdle with better graphics.
