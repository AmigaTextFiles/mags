<H3>2. The comeback of the EGS Spectrum - or: How to cheat the users</H3>
<P>
Some days ago we got the message, that the ZorroII(I) graphics board EGS
Spectrum is available again, especially from American dealers. It is
being sold with 2 MB of video RAM for around 190 US-$, which is approx.
173 Euros.

<P>
Usually we don't write about the quality of products, but in tests. But
it seems, that the users are to be cheated with an old and much too expensive
product, we feel compelled to make an exception in this case.
When being introduced, late in 1993, the EGS Spectrum was very convincing
in theory and in reality - no wonder, because no Cybervision 64 or other
products of similar power existed. But the Spectrum cannot compete with
with the speed of todays products, so it seems adviced to buy a (more)
modern baord, no meaning, if as a new or a used product. E.g the 3D cards
CyberVisionPPC and BVisionPPC of phase 5 don't cost much more than the
Spectrum are are much more powerful as independent benchmark tests showed.
Other powerful graphics boards can be gotten as used ones for much less money.
The Retina BLT Z3 for example (for beginners), the CyberVision 64/3D (allround
board of the middle class) or the already mentioned predecessor model
the CyberVision 64 (the hot tip for non-3D-users with a ZorroIII-Amiga).
And who wants a graphics board with good extension possibilities should
consider the PicassoIV by Village Tronic, which is, as you know, not
the cheapest one.
