Trouble with Eagle - Part II
</P>
<P>
After Marcus Konjevic, assistant manager of the German company media group
/ Eagle Computer was already mentioned in the preface of the last edition
he tried to get this priviledge again, during the last days - and as
it seems, with success.
</P>
<P>
What happened? A customer asked for help in a public Amiga forum, regarding
one of Eagles' tower conversion kits, because the clock frequency display
did not work. In addition he asked for another eMail address of the company,
because he did not receive a reply using the offical one. At the end he
asked, if the company went into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
A short time later a posting of Marcus Konjevic appeared in the forum,
in which he threatened with legal steps against the custoer, if he didn't
beg for pardon in written form for his &quot;crime&quot; at the manager of the company Eagle, Rudi
Konjevic (it's no coincidence, that the names are alike). An eMail with
more threats was sent to the customer (no more deliveries, etc.).
</P>
<P>
At the same time the webmaster of the Amiga forum was threatened with
the closure of his service due to obtain an interim order, if the entries
of the customer were not being deleted. The webmaster wasn't impressed of
this threats - there weren't any legal consequences to be afraid of.
</P>
<P>
I absolutely don't understand the hard reactions of Marcus Konjevic.
Someone asks just a few common questions in public - and is immediately
threatened with legal steps. I don't believe it! It seems, that Mr. Konjevic
hasn't heard of the guaranteed right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
I don't know any other Amiga company, which threatens with the prosecutor
for asking for help regarding one of its products in public. Even if it
was a public complaint, that it was not, most companies don't use those
hard methods.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time, that Eagle is recognized with messages of
this type. Marcus Konjevic wrote in one of his postings about a
conflict with the company Kuester Datensysteme. And I remember well the
conflict with a customer, who critisized the quality of the tower case,
manufactured by Eagle, what made Eagle call their lawyer. By the way,
that lawyer was G. Freiherr von Gravenreuth (rem. of the translator:
&quot;Freiherr von&quot; means &quot;Baron of&quot;), who specialized
on the computer branch.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Konjevic seems to have a very guilty conscience, if threatening with
the lawyer is the standard method of the company. It is most likely, that
this behavior is not useful for getting customers and without customers
a company has no chance to survive. Maybe Mr. Konjevic learns that, before
his company really has to go into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
See you next month,
</P>
<P>
yours,
