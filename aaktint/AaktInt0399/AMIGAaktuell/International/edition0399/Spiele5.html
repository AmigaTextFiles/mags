<H2>5. Review: Gunbee F99</H2>
<P>
Recently Gunbee F99 was published by APC&amp;TCP and is shipped in a
CD case, which unfortunately contains 2 floppy disks. A printed manual is
not available, but there are two AmigaGuide documents, which are in
English and German, after the installation on hard disk using
Commodore's Installer.
</P>
<P>
The story tells of the planet Valstyx and the princess Akiko, who is
captured by the troups of the evil Lord Khenmir. In addition the bandits
take the five magic crystals, which keep the planet in peace. So the
best architects of the planet develop the Gunbee F-99, a mible battle
suit, which enables you, Kiara McGuire, to rescue princess Akiko and the
five royal crystals from the clutches of the evil Lord Khenmir.
</P>
<P>
After the start of the game a screen appears, which is a bit puzzling
in the beginning, that lets you set some video options as well as the
language. Unfortunately these settings are not being save, so you have
to set them at every new start. After that an intro appears with some
badly, but colourful animated pictures. If you want to skip the intro
there will be some tries necessary, because the joystick trapping
doesn't seem to be excat. In the main menu it is possible to change
various options and to select between the two game modes: Honey Mode
and Story Mode. The Honey Mode is for the beginners while the Story Mode
is for the experts. Now just press the mouse button and start!
</P>
<P>
At once we are within the game, which has a small, not detailled screen.
The sprites are tiny, too. On the other hand Gunbee is good to play.
The control is done using a joystick with two buttons ore with a
joystick with one button and the keyboard. The opponents are not controlled
very intelligent, but it is not easy to complete the levels. Due to the
small sprites you have to have a good look or the game is over soon.
The fun with the game is evaluated as medium.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: The good made game engine suffers of the old designed
graphics. On one hand Gunbee is fun, but on the other hand the graphics
are not convincing. The sprites are too small, the screen is too small
and there are not enough colours. But the game needs AGA and 4 MB of
additional RAM. There was more that could have done with this game!
The graphics seem move you back in time to 1992. The music and the
SoundFX are a bit better than that.
