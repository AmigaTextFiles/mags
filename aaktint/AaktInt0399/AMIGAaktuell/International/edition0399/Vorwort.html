<P>
Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell international.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Once again, a calm month without sensations is over&quot; - this is
the preface I wanted to edit on Februrary 26th. But then the cat's out of the bag:
The two Amiga subsidiaries of Gateway, Amiga, Inc. and Amiga International
get a new president.
</P>
<P>
More informations regarding this theme are within this edition of AMIGA aktuell
international.
</P>
<P>
The internals of this edition:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> From now on, the well-known FD-charts are published within AMIGA aktuell
  international. After Stefan Rabe cancelled the creation in the early days
  of this year, we suggested to include the charts within AMIGA aktuell international,
  what was accepted by him, at once.
<P>
  From now on, Markus Castro Y Castro will do the FD-charts. You will be
  informed about changes, which go together with the new editor, in this
  edition, but there is one thing to add: The attendents of the FD-charts
  took part on a competition. This will also be in the future, but
  it is included into the competition of AMIGA aktuell international.
  There aren't any bigger changes in the rules. You still can get up to two
  tickets for the competition.
</P>
<P>
  With the correct attendence of the FD-charts you get one more ticket,
  so you can get up to three tickets for the competition.
  Please attend in great numbers!

<UL>
<LI> We are looking for someone, who wants to do his/her own AMIGA aktuell international
column, that informs about software updates. Each month there are new
revisions for countless FD and commercial AMIGA programs. This new column
should list the most important improvements of new software updates.<BR>
Who is interested in, to do that?
</LI>
<LI> We are still looking for testers of freely distributable software.
Everybody who wants to do this job is filled into a special distribution
list, and gets ideas for tests in unregular intervals. You aren' obliged
to perform the tests.
<P>
  Of course, we are happy about tests of commercial products as well.
