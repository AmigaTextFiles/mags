Hi!
</P>
<P>
In front of you there's a relly thick AMIGA aktuell international
games section! This month there are 5 reviews and 3 previews. Napalm
was tested twice, once from me and once from Manni Froitzheim. If you
would like to test a game, too, just send the articles to me. With the
two Napalm tests you again recognize, how different the opinions can
be.
</P>
<P>
The top theme of this month is, without doubt, the text about clickBOOM,
which appeared. After a talk with a Quake porter I think, some of this
might be true, too. But we should wait, what clickBOOM will tell us in
an official statement.
</P>
<P>
Another theme is pirate copying, again. Titan Computer officially confirmed,
that any product, except Settlers 2 and Claws of the Devil, has been
cancelled. So Total Combustion and Shadow of the third Moon 2 will not be
released! A part of the letter from Titan Computer: &quot;...these projects
have been cancelled due to the excessive pirate copying and the extremely
bad sales numbers, which go with that. The developers saw no reasonable
base for continuing their products, the Amiga market, which is small anyway,
is put under pressure by these bastards, which spread pirate copies.
Unfortunately these idiots haven't learned anything. But I hope, that
our two active projects (Clasw and Settlers2) will not be cancelled due
to them. IT IS ENOUGH.&quot; Clear words! Those of you, who were uncertain
reagarding the pirate copying, might be after this text section.
</P>

This month there were quite many games being published and also tested
at once. So you can read extensive reviews about Zombie Massacre, Imperator,
Gunbee F99 and Napalm. In addition there are previews about Nuxelia,
Super Soni and Virtual Grand Prix. It is noticed, that most games are
not state of the art in their graphics, which results in bad evaluations.
I am sorry about that, too. But I will not evaluate better, in any case
as the game really is, in opposition to an Amiga magazine, that evaluates
always over 90%. Who believes them is to blame himself. Even if there
aren't that many Amiga users there is no reason to cheat the users with
phantastic evaluations of some kind... well, I think, I digress. But I
get really angry, if I open this magazine, which was really good in the
past and don't find a program, which got less than 90% and that since
4 months! I also think the Amiga has to be supported, but not with those
fake evaluations! As always I am very interested in your comments regarding
this theme! To return the graphics quality of the newest games: well,
much of the games, which are published is on the graphical state of
1992. And then those games require AGA!!
</P>
<P>
Okay, I hope this preface was not too negative, but in the moment there
are happening some strange things...Anyway, have fun with this edition!

Yours,
