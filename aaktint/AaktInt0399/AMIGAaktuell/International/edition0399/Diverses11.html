<H3>11. Active Technologies announces TCP/IP stack Genesis</H3>
<P>
&raquo;Genesis is a state-of-the-art TCP/IP stack for the Amiga computer.
Combining ease of use with advanced features, Genesis offers built in
dialup Internet connectivity and/or local area networking.
</P>
<P>
Genesis requires Magic User Interface (v3.8+) in order to operate.
</P>
<P>
Further information can be obtained from <A HREF="http://www.vapor.com/" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.vapor.com/</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.active-net.co.uk" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.active-net.co.uk</A>. A demo is also available and you can register
online via the Vapor automatic registration form.
</P>
<P>
Feature list includes:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Easy to setup. The software is fully configurable via a custom
   interface, no need to edit text files. Offers simplicity, enabling a
   beginner to be able to setup their stack within minutes, yet keeping the
   advanced features needed for the professional user.
</LI>
<LI> Compatibility. Genesis is fully compatible with existing Amiga Internet
   software. Based on the recognised and established AmiTCP Professional
   kernel (v4.6), Genesis offers the highest possible compatibility with
   other net products, no need for AmiTCP emulation.
</LI>
<LI> Built-in support. Genesis ships with modules for PPP, (C)SLIP and
   support for other variations such as SANA-II etc. Supports Internet
   access by modem, external ISDN TA, internal ISDN boards, ethernet (such
   as Ariadne or Hydra), serial cards (Hypercom, IOBlix, GVP-IO etc) and
   other local networks (parnet, null modem etc).
</LI>
<LI> Advanced PPP implementation: (MS)CHAP, PAP, Callback (WinNT compatible),
   VJ compression, protocol field compression, MTU negotiation, magic
   number negotiation, async map negotiation, MSDNS1/2 IP address
   negotiation, WINS1/2 IP address negotiation, Compression Control
   Protocol (modules include - BSD compress, deflate and MPPC). Also, PPP
   events control allows you to create scripts to perform actions when PPP
   has been put on or offline.
</LI>
<LI> Dial control. Teach-me dialer, multiple phone numbers, configurable dial
   script.
</LI>
<LI> Comprehensive security. Secure kernel to prevent illegal attacks over
   the Internet: SYN flooding, IP fragment attacks, IP address spoofing,
   land and fist attacks.
</LI>
<LI> Enhanced SANA-II. Powerful and improved SANA-II support allows the
   fastest transfer rates across an ethernet network.
</LI>
<LI> Connection Wizard. Step by step Wizard interface to connect a user to
   the Internet. Enter basic information, Wizard obtains the IP and DNS
   information automatically and records your loginscript.
</LI>
<LI> Arexx interface and improved API - allows external software to check
   status of interfaces, logged in user, active user and much more.
</LI>
<LI> Socks. Socks v4/5 client supplied as standard. Socks server avaialble,
   free of charge, as a downloadable option.
</LI>
<LI> Multiple interface support. This allows you to connect and disconnect
   more than one interface at one time. For instance, create two ethernet
   links between an Amiga and Linux machine and another betweenyour Amiga
   and PC and then still connect and disconnect from your Internet (dialup)
   connection, without the other interfaces being affected. You can even
   launch Genesis on bootup so that a local area network is put online
   automatically when you start your Amiga. This is essential for a Siamese
   system, for example. You can then use Genesis for modem dialup or route
   your dialup connection via the remote computer. Multiple interface
   support is easy to setup and the interfaces are listed within the main
   status window (shown here). Allows routing between interfaces.
</LI>
<LI> Multiple-user support. Full support and API for multiple-users. Create
   more than one user and then log-on via the main status window (users can
   be password protected to prevent unauthorised access). The multi-user
   API is currently supported by a range of Amiga Internet software
   including Microdot-II, Contact Manager and soon YAM (from r7), with more
   in the future.
</LI>
<LI> Multiple providers. Add multiple providers or provider configurations
   with ease, then select these providers by point and click, from the main
   status window. You might be testing two providers with a 30-day trial?
   Setup both providers and flick between them.
</LI>
<LI> Access control. Parents have full time/access control over each user.
   The system manager can setup time limitations (for example a user could
   be prevented from connecting during the working hours 09:00-18:00).
   Genesis will double-check the current time on connection, so that the
   user cannot temporarily alter the system clock to fool software into
   thinking it is a weekend, for instance.
</LI>
<LI> Advanced time/cost logger. Shows each user access (or overall access),
   time and date and the cost of this access. Genesis shows statistical
   information to help you monitor Internet costs and time usage.
