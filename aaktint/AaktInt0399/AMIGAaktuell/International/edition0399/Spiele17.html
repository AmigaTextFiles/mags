The Sega Mega Drive Emulator AmiGenerator runs on 68k as well as on PPC Amigas.
But an acceptable speed can be accomplished on PPC only. Then it shall run with
35 fps.

The emulator True Reality, which emulates a Nintendo 64
is more fun than a real emulator. The well-known Amiga programmer Steffen
Haeuser said, that the emulator just emulates the CPU and no special graphics
chips, which are needed by most games. In common, most people don't have any understanding
for it and say that programmers should not waste their time for porting tr*sh
like that.

The NESA sound format is under further development by Gaelan Griffin, now and
not by the authors of A/NES. Gaelan Griffin also programmed the SPC sound player
Anonymous as well as the SPC converter SPC Record. The NESA sound format allows
to save and to play sounds from NES ROM files. For that purpose the nesa.library
exists, which is supported by an Eagle player and a Deliplayer.

The well-known Amiga emulation page 'Amiga Emulation Central' seems to be
closed. Since a long time there were no updates. The author was quite sloppy
with the updates. It is a pity, it was very good page!
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh emulator Basilisk II by Christian Bauer, who is also the
author of ShapeShifter, will be released in an Amiga version, too.
