<H2>News from the house of Amiga</H2>
<H3>1. The Sensation: Amiga Gets A New President</H3>
<P>
Rumours, which said that the Amiga parent company Gateway was very dissatisfied about
the things done up to now, seem to become true.
In a press release the development department of Amiga, Amiga, Inc., announces
changes in the management of the two Amiga subsidiaries of Gateway, Amiga, Inc.
and Amiga International, Inc.: The new president of the joint companies will
be Jim Collas, previous executive vice president of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
Petro Tyschtschenko will continue to work for Amiga International as manager
of the sales and marketing depratment and keep the Amiga community informed
regarding the status of the NextGeneration-Amiga.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the development of the new Amiga generation moved to
San Diego. First products of this series are to be on the market before
the year 2000. At first a developer system, an Internet machine as well as
a lowcost homecomputer following the tradition of the A500 are planned.
Detailled plans and various strategic partners are to be announced within
the summer.
</P>
<P>
The product development remains in the hands of Jeff Schindler, while a
software development center is to be built in San Jose, managed by Dr.
Allan Havemose. The team programming the new Amiga operating system based
on QNX is to be rapidly expanded within the next months.
</P>
<P>
And here is the press release:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Amiga Announces New President and Fast-track Development Plans
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO, California. - February 26, 1999 - In a series of meetings in San Diego,
representatives of Amiga Inc. and Amiga International met to hammer out the
details of technical, strategic and marketing plans which will see the launch
of a range of new Amiga-based computers for the next millennium. The company
has relocated its headquarters to San Diego and Jim Collas will be serving as
the new president of Amiga.
</P><P>
"Amiga is an amazing opportunity that we must act on now or it will be lost
forever," said Collas. "The Amiga platform is ideal for Internet-ready,
consumer-oriented digital appliances of the future. The Amiga name is
associated the world over with user-friendly, low cost, powerful computing. We
will take this philosophy into the next generation, enabling products from hand
held Internet appliances to high-end graphics computers that help the user
rather than frustrate them."
</P><P>
Collas, formerly a senior vice president for Amiga's parent company, Gateway,
will be running Amiga as a wholly independent subsidiary operation and will
integrate Amiga Inc. and Amiga International under the new Amiga corporate
structure. His leadership will allow the company to step up a fast - track
development program that is currently underway.
</P><P>
Amiga is planning to launch next generation products worldwide before the New
Year. They will be announcing detailed product plans and introducing several of
their strategic partners over the summer. Products currently targeted for the
initial launch are a development system, an Internet appliance, and a low cost
home computer in the tradition of the Amiga A500 that dominated home computing
in the late eighties and early nineties. The developers system will be
available with a software development suite for low cost development on the new
platform.
</P><P>
Jeff Schindler, in charge of product strategy for Amiga, is planning the new
Amiga product line. "The Amiga community has been doing incredible things on a
platform which hasn't had an official update in eight years," said Schindler.
"They deserve a system which lets them show off their talents."
</P><P>
Amiga's administrative center in San Diego will shortly be complemented by a
software development center under the leadership of Dr. Allan Havemose, vice
president of Engineering for Amiga, in San Jose, California. The Silicon Valley
team will be rapidly expanded over the coming months to develop revolutionary
Amiga multimedia layers over the real-time Neutrino OS core from QNX Software
Systems Ltd.
</P><P>
Petro Tyschtschenko will continue on as managing director of Amiga
International and will also play a critical role in guiding the current Amiga
community through the transition to the new Amiga architecture. "The new Amiga
plans are a rebirth for Amiga and an exciting journey into the future," said
Tyschtschenko.

<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
Now Gateway lost their patience - at last. The introduction of a new president
for both Amiga subsidiaries allows the speculation, that the parent company
was not satisfied with the work of the development department nor with
Amiga International, responsible for sales and marketing. It is most likely,
that Petro Tyschtschenko was evaluated better than Jeff Schindler, because
the press release mentions the marketing department, located in Germany,
only in passing. In addition it seems not to be target of big changes.
</P>
<P>
Quite different is the situation for the development department: In addition
to a moving of the headquater in the neighbourhood to the hightech center
Silicon Valley, what isn't bad at all, it seems that all efforts are made
to speed up the development of the new Amiga. No other conclusion can be
made considering this press release. That the previous manager of Amiga, Inc.
remains in the company Amiga does not necessarily mean that the new president
is just a slave driver and a watchdog: Jim Collas absolutely has the
knowledge of technic and programming. Last year in London, on the World of Amiga,
when he was Senior Vice President of Gateway, he and his staff announced the
details of the planned Amiga developer system. He is familiar with the
project of the &quot;NextGeneration-Amiga&quot; and is absolutely competent
enough to introduce own ideas.
</P>
<P>
One thing is certain: Jeff Schindler and Petro Tyschtschenko work in very good
positions at Amiga - but the important decisions are being made by someone
different: Jim Collas, the new manager of Amiga.
