<H3>6. Haage &amp; Partner sells Ethernet card</H3>
<P>
</P>
<P>
&raquo;The Netax1200 is the best solution for Amiga 1200/600 owners to network<BR>
their computers in a smart and cheap way. The card plugs in the PCMCIA slot and<BR>
gives a fast, powerful and reliable Ethernet connection, in a 100% compatible<BR>
way with other platforms. The Netax1200 is a fast PCMCIA "credit card" who<BR>
comes with a detailed printed manual, a pass-trough "T" connector for BNC<BR>
cables and a disk including the Netax software for Amiga Systems. The software<BR>
features a standard system device (netax.device), that makes the card<BR>
compatible with almost every Amiga networking software, including Genesis,<BR>
NetConnect, AmiTCP, Miami and MiamiDeLuxe. The device fully complies<BR>
to SANA-II specifics, so also other software like Envoy run flawlessly and with<BR>
no bottlenecks.<BR>
</P><P>
The Netax1200 also features a full combo connector for both standard UTP and<BR>
BNC cabled networks, and can also be plugged while your computer is on with no<BR>
risk for the computer or the peripherals. By providing a full Ethernet<BR>
connection, the Netax1200 can be used to network the Amiga with almost every<BR>
other computer as PCs, MACs, UNIX like systems and so on.<BR>
</P><P>
The card consumes no CPU time, leaving your processor free for other<BR>
applications, unlike other networking devices do, and assures you unthinkable<BR>
speeds also on the plain 68000 mounted on the Amiga 600. We recommend anyway at<BR>
least a 68030 processor to get the best out of your Netax1200 and reach higher<BR>
speed rates. Our tests indicate that in FTP mode, the Netax1200 provides speeds<BR>
not lower than 500kb/sec. with peaks of 600kb/sec on a simple 030. With a 060<BR>
processor the speed goes over 800kb/sec, making the Netax1200 one of the<BR>
fastest card available for any Amiga model.<BR>
