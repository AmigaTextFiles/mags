<H3>4. Problems when connecting with AmIRC</H3>
<P>
&raquo;I have this problem: When browsing through the Internet I found a brilliant
chat address. It is located at <A HREF="http://unicum-chat.deutschland.de" TARGET="_TOP">http://unicum-chat.deutschland.de</A>:4000.
I always chatted directly from the university (only, if there was an unproductive phase, of course), via
PC either with the Explorer or the Netscape Communicator (only due to the extreme telephone costs, else I prefer the AMIGA).
As most chatters might know the addiction is a not unimportant factor, so I tried my luck from
home. But it happened, what I was afraid of, because the program is controlled via
Java or JavaScript applications. I own the Aminet versions of IBrowse and the newest test versions
of VoyagerNG and AWebII. My last hope I could join the chat using AWebII is gone. It is most likely this is caused from the
quite spoiled revision of the JavaScript support. CGI seems to play a role in this game, too.
As far as I know, no Amiga browser is able to execute CGI programs, in the moment.

</P>
<P>
Then I downloaded the latest version of AmIRC from the net and tried to
join the unicum chat with i. As a server name I entered unicum-chat.deutschland.de.
As port: 4000. All the other ports, which have been listed in the server list were: 6667.
From the bubble-help I learned, that this is the common port, but also 6666
and 6665 could be used (faster connections possible). But 4000 wasn't mentioned.
I tried 4000 anyway and the connection to the server worked, but the log-in didn't.
I entered nickname, password, etc. but I always got the message: &quot;can't find port&quot;.
After some more tries, also with 2230 as port (information from the URL line in the
browser, if I am in the chat with my identity), I gave up, at last.
</P>
<P>
Just of interest I tried the common adresses of the program. There weren't any
problems at all. Just one thing (but just a tiny one): all the addresses are
within areas with English language, but one swiss address, which could not be
found.
Who can give me some advice, how to solve this problem?
Because I don't have much knowledge (let's say nearly none) with IRC and
various chat programs I ask you to excuse my questions, which might be
quite stupid for old IRClers.
</P>
<P>
Just one important question: How can I find out different IRC adresses (especially
with German language)?
A tip: You could publish an overview about IRC addresses (similar to your mailbox list).
[Is there anyone who would like to publish such a list?; remark of the editor]
</P>
<P>
If there are more users (maybe I'm not the only one) which don't know this
range you could publish a workshop about IRC. [Is there anyone, who would
like to write an IRC workshop?; remark of the editor]
