<H3>3. Petro Tyschtschenko's Speech at 'BCS India '98'</H3>

Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>
Distinguished Guests,<BR><BR>


I'm very pleased to be here in India and to be in the position to present Amiga to you.<BR>
The Indian market is to me one of important ones and I'm very often in India to support and to negotiate with my distributors and last but not least to meet some of the Indian dealers.<BR>
You can take a look at our Amiga products with Jona Photo from India at his booth number F 16.<BR><BR>

Now, dear guests, let me introduce myself.<BR>
My name is Petro Tyschtschenko, I am President of AMIGA International, Inc. in Germany.<BR>
In 1982 I started my career in the computer business at a very well known company called Commodore International.<BR>
Everyone of you knows the C 64 Computer of Commodore. Commodore distributed 14 million C64 Computers world wide.<BR><BR>

In 1984 Commodore acquired the Amiga technology.<BR>
And here starts my part. Since that time I am involved with our brilliant Amiga Computer for 13 years now!<BR>
And I never regretted it.<BR><BR>

Let me tell you the magic of Amiga from the very well beginning:<BR>
In 1985 in New York Commodore presented the new computer to an amazed press. What journalists saw there was the beginning of a big adventure for millions of people world wide: The AMIGA was born!<BR>
The first Multimedia Computer was shown to the public.<BR>
Multimedia....The keyword Multimedia: an important keyword for those who know that AMIGA actually invented Multimedia. <BR><BR>

The Amiga Computers have an own computer platform with own architecture.<BR>
Amiga's incredible features of video, sound and animation, thanks to a smart design of custom processors, bundled to a fully multitasking OS and the powerful 32-bit series 68000 processor from Motorola quickly made the AMIGA the system of choice for all computer fans. Especially because he was affordable and extremely effective regarding exploitation of memory and performance.<BR>
With only 2 MB Ram you can run several application at the same time and without delay.<BR><BR>

Please remember that the year 1974 was the beginning age of microcomputers and the PC-Industry.<BR>
The first AMIGA had 256 Kilobytes of Memory and an 880 Kilobyte 3,5 inch disk drive. Ten years later, hundreds of megabytes of memory can be used and the latest 68060 processor from Motorola is 100 times faster than the original 68000. Through this computer, a real community of users has been formed. Software and hardware suppliers quickly joined the bandwagon to create a true environment for those who new from the beginning that the AMIGA was more than just a tool to type letters and to run spreadsheets. <BR><BR>

From 1984 to 1994 there were 12 millions Amiga Computers sold.<BR>
Commodore went out of business in 1994. Nobody could believe that the pioneer of Computers, Commodore, went into liquidation, and so Amiga. The reasons for this disaster was Commodore's PC product range.... low margins and nearly every three months a new processor generation.<BR><BR>

Amiga could stay alive let alone because of the big user groups and Amiga fanatics which amount to 1 million all over the world.<BR>

Luckily in 1995 I could make the deal with Escom AG in Germany and Amiga had a new potential mother company.<BR>
Escom an international PC retailer with more than 1.000 outlets and 3.000 employees and 2.3 billion Deutsch Mark Revenue.<BR>
Escom took over the complete technological and intellectual property at an auction in New York on 21st of April 95. On July 15, 1996 Escom AG declared their insolvency again because of the PC disaster.<BR><BR>

Between September 1995 and December 1998, AMIGA sold approximately 70,000 Amiga Computers world wide. The Amiga stayed alive from the day of the declaration of insolvency.<BR>

And than finally it happened: <BR>
On March 12, 1997 GATEWAY, Inc. took over the complete technological and intellectual assets.<BR>

The trust GATEWAY, Inc., based in the United States in South Dakota, has 14,000 employees world wide. In 1997, a turnover of 6,3 billion US dollars was made and the net profit for the same period was at 100 million US dollars. <BR>

GATEWAY, Inc. -our mother company - considers the AMIGA as a precious technology, with bright future. The Amiga technology is used as another "key to success". GATEWAY, Inc. received hundreds of user letters from all around the world, asking them to continue manufacturing and developing the system.<BR>

This is actually a phenomenon that can only be observed very rarely for a product: 
Commitment and even attachment of a devoted international community. Support by dozens of dedicated magazines: More than ten magazines in Germany and the UK alone! And several more in other countries, like in Italy, USA, Sweden, France, Netherlands, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

All these factors made GATEWAY, Inc. decide to buy AMIGA and create a new subsidiary: AMIGA International, Inc. The commitment to the technology and its future was demonstrated in London, at a major international press conference on May 17, 1997.<BR><BR>
Our intention is:<BR><BR>

1.      Supporting the existing Amiga community<BR>
2.      Leveraging the existing Amiga technology through brought licensing<BR>
3.      Assisting in developing new products based on open standards to the home computer and video/graphics market.<BR><BR>

Meanwhile we have founded a Research & Development department in USA called Amiga Inc.<BR> 
In November 98 they announced their partnership with a software company in Canada called QNX.<BR><BR>

Their targeted features for the new generation are:<BR>
Scalable and modular design<BR>

Please let me introduce our distributor Rajan Malhan form Jona Photo. As I already mentioned you can take a look at our products at his booth.<BR><BR>

Now, let me come to the main part of my speech.<BR><BR>

The video market is a very interesting market with world wide innovations. Not only the people who are working in the media branch must be flexible, the hardware must be, too.
Most Video studios which invest money are focusing especially the efficiency, the system is not the decision making point. The definition of efficiency is:
Speed, quality and a pleasant user interface  the platform is not relevant. Only the result is important.<BR><BR>

Since the introduction of the Amiga Computers the company AMIGA International, Inc. could establish a big market and is highly regarded. Engineers, technicians and software experts have discovered the Amiga technology and the needs of the market. They have used the Amiga technology and put a lot of effort in their development. Like this they created an unrivalled computer system, usable for every kind of Video processing, even today  THE AMIGA.<BR><BR>

The Amiga Computer has 3 essential advantages in comparison with his competitors:<BR>
1.      Special designed hardware, the so called Custom Chips<BR>
2.      A lean and efficient operating system with pre-emptive Multitasking<BR>
3.      The favourable price in comparison with his efficiency<BR><BR>

The video norm screen is one of his standards and each model has the RGB Port. The high range of the interface, which is very essential for Video processing,  is related to the TV standard. This makes even small Amiga Computers broadcastable and easy to use in the Television without expensive assemblings.<BR>

The model A1200 has an CVBS exit for the connection to all video recorders or overhead projectors; so even small video studios and home workers can make their business.<BR>

Free programmable and video resolution grant the compatibility to all different kinds of world standards at video systems, and you can use NTSC or PAL versions.
The screen mode like PAL HiRes Interlaced are taking care for the full and efficient use of the PAL video standard. The 560 screen lines (which are in this resolution available) are sufficient even for professional users with Betacam SP equipment.<BR>

With the RGB interface the Amiga is ideal for the use in broadcast video studios or to connect the Genlocks from third party companies. The product range starts from simple devices for non-professional camera men and ends with professional solutions. The Genlocks have standard FBAS-, Y/C exits or component exits or entrances  it depends on the price. You see, the Amiga is the ideal device for low cost and high end productions.<BR><BR>

Genlocks are using the basic technology and the principles of the Amiga operating system.<BR>
The Genlock cuts out the colour "0” and replaces it by the video signal. A feature which is consequently used by each available video software. The result is a high Television resolution with the best quality and colour.<BR>
Thanks to AGA graphic chips, because with this chip the user has 256 colours with highest resolution (PAL Hires Interlaced) and in its vertical half video resolution 256.000 colours (HAM8) available.<BR>
Modern Genlocks, like SiriusII of electronic design can do much more. Those devices have already an audio mixing console as well as an Alpha channel which makes pre definite colours half visible. Very important for name fade-ins on the Television screen.<BR><BR>

The logical connection from the Amiga computer to the software available, grants the necessary success and assures you to have a big range of variety to produce a video.<BR>

Real-time is the slogan for many programs available, especially designed for Amiga. Just take the Scala Multimedia MM 300, which is a standard program on the A1200 HD, is used world wide for television and video production. This shows the high quality of this special software and its acceptance with professional companies. A simple graphical user interface, direct hardware programming and real-time effect functions are the success of this software. There is no long studying necessary  even users with low or no knowledge can learn easily the functions of Scala.
For example: you choose the background, than you tap in the text and choose some kind of letter type. During this time you can watch the results on the screen or Television  and all this without waiting.<BR>

Scala has incredible effects and high precision. 
The most difficult issue the "anti alising” has been so perfectly solved that there is simply no issue anymore.
Each text line and the screen site can be made up with fade in and fade out effects. Scala provides his user with an exact timing for all effects. Alternative the controlling via mouse is possible, too. Another feature is the remote control of other programs with the language AREXX, another standard included in the Amiga Computers. This makes the hardware controllable, variable figures can be defined and the result can be faded in at the screen; of course files of other programs, too.
One more important argument is that a scrolling text does not shake. So, the running text is always fluid. 
This little wonder is because of the perfect match of Amiga hardware and Amiga software. 
No VGA card does have such a power.<BR><BR>

With Scala Infochannel it becomes extremely professional, because you can run with it whole networks. Ideal for POI (Point of Information) and POS (Point of Sale). Of course with inter active user interface for all customers. The data actualisation can be done online with the server remote control.
The customer can choose the required menu with a touch screen.<BR><BR>

Different software has different solutions which range from Video FX (Haage &amp; Partner) to professional 3D animations. The market is completely covered. 
The high quality software stands the test which proves many television series like, SeaQuest, Babylon V and many others. The big cinema movie Jurassic Park was made by Amiga networks, too.<BR><BR>

Of course you can use the Amiga for non linear video editing. Professional video studios are counting on solutions like Toaster form Newtek, Personal Animation or Draco, an Amiga clone from Germany.<BR>

Beside the 68 processors from Motorola, there are today the PPC and G3 processor series supported by the Amiga Operating System and the most important application programs. 
RAM and HDD (128MB Ram, Phase 5) are without problems upgradable.
The DraCo System provides non-linear video editing up to 4 Terrabyte harddisk capacity. Ideal for a longer video with many raw material.<BR><BR>

On the Amiga market there are sound cards of different companies, which you can use parallel. While one audio card is playing the other records. It is the same with many graphic cards which can be used for special applications. DTP, CAD no problem with Amiga. Multi monitor solutions are a well know word for Amiga.<BR><BR>

Especially the smart operating system has many advantages. 
The use of Datatypes (free available file formats in Aminet since Workbench 3.0) makes it possible to include every kind of file format. Converting problems do not exist. The Amiga Operating System offers in every application program the possibility to get access to standard resources. There are no hidden registration files, which makes the erasure of installed programs very difficult.<BR><BR>

You can make as many installations as you want the Amiga Operating System is very easy to overlook and easy to control. The Amiga does not loose his power and speed. The pre-emptive multitasking makes it possible to work with an Amiga and only the FastRam and ChipRam limits the numbers of programs. 
In word processing you can write a letter, search a certain address in the data bank and calculate an animation  all this at the same time and with one Amiga!
Normally quality has its price. But with an Amiga Computer you get a complete system to a favourable price. The A1200 is the ideal computer for the start. This computer is delivered with <BR>
260 MB Hard disk<BR>
2MB ChipRam<BR>
Mouse<BR>
Power supply<BR>
Monitor connection<BR>

The relating Video software Scala MM 300 is enclosed, together with word processing, paint program and the current Amiga Operating System.<BR><BR>

It is not a problem to achieve more information about the A1200 the handy keyboard computer, there are world wide many third party companies available to support you with hardware solutions and ideal expandability solutions.
If the store in your A1200 should be full  no problem, the solution is a modification kit which makes your A1200 to an extended and large computer with space for harddisks, add ons and others.<BR><BR>

Distinguished guests, <BR>
thank you very much for your attenetion and interest. For your information you can find the whole speech printed in the conference publiacation available here at the fair.
I wish everybody a pleasant and successful Broadcast Satellite &amp; Cable exhibition 1998 and hopefully we see us in 1999.<BR><BR><BR>
