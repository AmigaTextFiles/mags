<p>As General Manager of Amiga, Inc. there are times when we can all lose sight of dreams vs.
reality.  I have to admit I would sometimes choose to dream the impossible   Amiga is not
just about dreaming; it's about implementing dreams and making them a reality.  We've been
working very hard to see that this happen.  I believe that in order to take this company to the
next level, we must stay focused on delivering the dreams not just talking about them in
hopes that they will happen.
<p>  
<p>At Computer '98, we announced of our alliance with QNX as the foundation for the Next
Generation Amiga Architecture.  We have taken the leap towards flying  and I saw the
enthusiasm in many people's eyes, and could feel the electricity in the air!  The excitement
that the future holds is great; we are looking forward to working with QNX and their team. 
QNX brings the foundation of technology and the values of what Amiga has always been. 
The QNX RTOS is a foundation that we can build on.   It's only with a secure foundation
that the tallest of buildings arise.  This will not just be an architect's dream, or a contractor's
vision, we are dedicated in making this a reality.   Reality is  the tallest buildings are not
built overnight.  They take planning, commitment, focus, and a lot of sweat.
<p>
<p>We are embarking on new territory, and there maybe those who will oppose our strategy. 
Some will struggle with change and not support our future plans.  Some will disagree with
the path we have chosen.  To those I would say, "Lets not get stuck in the past or live in a
dream world."  Let's all work together in making Amiga not just a community name, but a
name that will be recognized throughout the world.  A name we can all be proud of.
<p>
<p>The recent events over the last few weeks, have hit the community like a shock wave rippling
with excitement and fear.  It's unfortunate that we have had so much confusion and rumors. 
Change is difficult and  please believe me when I say,  I understand the value that the
community brings.  I empathize with each and everyone one of you through these hard times
of rebuilding.  You must remember that Amiga is bigger than any one person or computer. 
It's about people who aren't afraid to walk up to the edge, look over, see all that's there, and
then take the leap to fly.  We don't live in a dream, we live in reality and this is where the
rubber meets the road.
<p>
<p>The vision is in place, the architects have started work, now we must be patient to see the
building rise.  In order for this to happen, it is vital that community is united.  The User
Group community support is essential in evangelizing the world (come see this new building). 
The Development community is critical in expanding and networking it from one building
into many.  This is Amiga and now more than ever we must all take the leap towards flying
as the world stands back in awe.  We can do this a community of not only dreamers but
dreamers who know reality and aren't afraid to fly.
<p>
<p>Thanks for your support and always keeping Amiga in your heart.
