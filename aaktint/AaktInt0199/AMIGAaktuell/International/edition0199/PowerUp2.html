<H3>2. Status of the Escana-G3-project</H3>

»Braunschweig, December 22, 1998<BR>
Status of the G3-project!<BR>
Out of time considerations we had planned to implement a simplified memory<BR>
interface that would enable us to test the board as well as present it at the<BR>
Computer '98 show. This simplified interface did not feature ZorroIII bus<BR>
mastering. Since no prototype could be built in time for the show we went ahead<BR>
and implemented the full memory controller right away.<BR>
Our initial plans had been to do the full implementation once we have a working<BR>
prototype and the actual production begins. Implementing the memory interface<BR>
now presented us with a few problems that had to be addressed first, but this<BR>
also means that we will not have to face these problems later.<BR>
Another reason for doing the memory interface earlier is the fact that we now<BR>
have access to a SUN UltraSPARC that offers much greater resources for Verilog<BR>
simulations than the PC did that was used for that purpose up to now. However,<BR>
the Christmas season and new year's celebrations mean that the first prototypes<BR>
will not go into production until some time in January.<BR>
To sum things up: we are a little behind schedule (although not as far as one<BR>
might think based on the fact that there are still no prototypes available). We<BR>
ask for your understanding, especially since the memory interface is a<BR>
technologically very sophisticated solution. However, our goal remains to be<BR>
shipping the first production boards by the end of the first quarter.«<BR>
