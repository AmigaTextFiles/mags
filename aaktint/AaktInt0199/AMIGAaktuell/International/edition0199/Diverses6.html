&raquo;CLOANTO RELEASES AMIGA FOREVER ONLINE EDITION
</P>
<P>
Cloanto is proud to announce Amiga Forever Online Edition, the first
Amiga software title available for sale and download entirely by
electronic means in hundreds of online stores. To make this possible,
Cloanto has entered a partnership with Digital River, the world's
leading electronic distributor, which has a reputation for reliable and
secure transactions, and is preferred by leading software companies
(e.g. Adobe, Corel, Lotus, IBM, etc.) for their own online sales.
</P>
<P>
The Online Edition of Amiga Forever is Cloanto's answer to all PC users
and Amiga enthusiasts who are looking for a quick and easy way to
&quot;download Amiga ROMs&quot; and run the emulation without requiring all of the
extra features provided by the Amiga Forever CD-ROM, yet appreciating
its &quot;one click&quot; ease of use. The Online Edition contains Amiga 1.3 and
3.0 ROM and OS environments, configured and ready for use with the
WinUAE emulator (which is also installed and preconfigured automatically
as part of the Online Edition). Third-party Amiga disk images available
from online and CD-ROM collections of &quot;Amiga Classics&quot; can be mounted
and run in the emulation. The preinstalled emulation environment can
very easily be upgraded as new versions of WinUAE or other emulation
programs become available. Fellow and the DOS version of UAE, which can
be downloaded from the respective sites, also run fine with Amiga
Forever Online Edition, where directories are already set up to contain
these emulators. The latest version of the Amiga Explorer networking
software is included.

<P>
As part of a &quot;1999/19.99&quot; promotional campaign which will last until the
beginning of the New Year, the software is available for immediate
download at the special price of $19.99, following the links on the
Amiga Forever Online Edition home page, and from the network of Digital
River's online partners.
