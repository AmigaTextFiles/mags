<H3>5. Security Advisory for AMIGA Internet users</H3>
»<U>Security Advisory for Amiga Internet users</U><BR>
by Nordic Global Inc., 12/05/98,  for immediate release<BR>
During the first week of December a list of over 700 stolen user<BR>
names, passwords and host names of Internet service providers was<BR>
circulated in the &quot;scene&quot; and posted in several places, including<BR>
Usenet. Most public postings did not include the passwords, but<BR>
they ARE present in the original list, i.e. the list DOES exist,<BR>
and presents a real threat to users on the list.<BR>
Anyone in possession of the list can use entries on the list to<BR>
break into Internet accounts of corresponding users, unless those<BR>
users changed their passwords in the meantime. In other words:<BR>
if YOU appear on the list then anyone who has that list can break<BR>
into YOUR Internet account, until/unless you change your password.<BR>
Some of the entries on the list were obtained using &quot;normal&quot; means,<BR>
i.e. by breaking into ISP routers or exploiting known Unix or NT<BR>
system vulnerabilities. Things like that happen all the time, and<BR>
are difficult to prevent.<BR>
However many entries on the list were obtained using a different<BR>
mechanism: a &quot;Trojan&quot; distributed to Amiga users, that secretely<BR>
spied username/password information out, and sent them to an<BR>
Internet account, where that information was gathered by pirates.<BR>
After a lot of false and sometimes slanderous rumors how that<BR>
secret mechanism works and which program is to blame, a joint<BR>
effort by Nordic Global Inc. and several helpful users, who<BR>
wish to stay anonymous, finally determined the precise way the<BR>
passwords were gathered:<BR>
A pirate group spread a fake version of &quot;datatypes.library&quot;<BR>
via Aminet. That version has a version number of either 45.4<BR>
or 45.5 (depending on when and how you check the version), and<BR>
a file size of 32748 bytes. The library contains a concealed<BR>
Trojan that reads usernames and passwords from the Internet<BR>
settings files on your harddisk, and sends them by email to a<BR>
pirate group, who then collects that information and enters it<BR>
into a database.<BR>
If you have that version of &quot;datatypes.library&quot; installed, then<BR>
you are strongly advised to delete it, and to replace it with<BR>
one of the legitimite, safe versions of datatypes.library, e.g.<BR>
one of<BR>
<UL>
<LI> 39.11 (from Workbench disks)</LI>
<LI> 40.6 (from Workbench disks)</LI>
<LI> 45.3 (from Aminet)</LI>
<LI> 45.4 (from Aminet)</LI>
</UL>
If you install 45.4 then make sure the file size is 27780 bytes.<BR>
If it is 32748 bytes then it is actually the dangerous, fake<BR>
version 45.5, reporting a wrong version number, not the &quot;real&quot;<BR>
version 45.4.<BR>
After that you should physically switch off your computer, wait<BR>
for 30 seconds, and switch it on again, just in case.<BR>
Once you have done that, log into your Internet provider and<BR>
change your password. If you have previously already changed your<BR>
password, but did not replace the fake library, then you should<BR>
change your password again now, because your account information<BR>
may have been compromised again in the meantime.<BR>
It is not known for sure yet who the author of that fake library<BR>
and &quot;collector&quot; of the generated stolen accounts is, but an<BR>
investigation is underway. Also, there are very strong, yet so<BR>
far unconfirmed, indications (including witness statements by<BR>
informants) that the infamous pirate group &quot;Digital Corruption&quot;<BR>
is to blame for this.<BR>
If that turned out to be true then it would only prove once again<BR>
that software written or distributed by or in cooperation with<BR>
pirate organizations cannot be trusted, and may have harmful<BR>
secret side effects.<BR>
If you are wondering why it is Nordic Global Inc. who are making<BR>
this announcement: the original password list that was distributed<BR>
contains a comment in obscene language that those passwords were<BR>
obtained through an alleged &quot;backdoor in Miami&quot;.<BR>
Do not be fooled by that. That claim is an obvious lie, a slanderous<BR>
accusation attempting to tarnish the reputation of Miami and Nordic<BR>
Global Inc., without any factual basis. Amiga pirate groups, in<BR>
particular Digital Corruption, have been targetting Nordic Global<BR>
Inc. with accusations like that for quite some time because of our<BR>
strong public stand against piracy.<BR>
Miami does not have any &quot;backdoors&quot;, and could not be used, and was<BR>
not used to compile the list, or to provide any information that<BR>
appeared on the list. Nevertheless many users and unfortunately<BR>
even some developers and dealers spread the false rumor that Miami<BR>
is &quot;dangerous&quot; in any way. This is obviously not the case.<BR>
We felt it necessary to try and find out the truth about how the<BR>
list was compiled, not only to document the safety of Miami, but<BR>
also to be able to give Amiga users the information they need to<BR>
react to this threat and to prevent further damage.<BR>
