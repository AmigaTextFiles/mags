<H2>6. Review: OloFight</H2>
<P>
OloFight by the newcomer The Real Ologram is delivered on 10 disks in
a nicely designed box. In addition you get a lot of extra goodies
like posters, stickers, etc. The manual is in German (remark of the
translator: there is also an English manual available).
The game has to be installed to hard disk, where it needs approx. 10 MB
of free disk space. The installation is without errors due to the
Commodore Installer. OloFight needs at least an A1200 or A4000, 0.7 MB
of Chip-RAM and 1.8 MB of Fast-RAM. A patch for graphic boards is expected
to be available soon.
</P>

The story is of the last descendants of humanity, which live spreaded over
eight artificial planets. Because Earth was destroyed by a star collision,
they moved to the planet of Kobaia. But this planet became to a desert due
to wars and so they had to leave it to settle down on the planets built
by themselves. But then Thitan, the ex-leader of the planet of Karn, the
gigantic energy generated by the core of Kobaias. Bold soldiers of the
eight planets are trying to stop Thitan, before he is able to build his
energy generator. Unfortunately they don't combine their powers against
Thitan, but fight on their own and thei always fight, if they meet. This
is, what happens in the game.

After starting the game you have to enter the serial number and your
name. In addition you have to answer a manual question. After this
you are introduced to eight different races by short animations. There
are 5 different game modi alltogehter. In the Story Mode you have to
lead a fighter to victory and distroy all the others. In the Survial Mode
you can test against how many computer controlled enemy fighters you can
win, until your vital energy is down. If you win a fight you get some
vital energy as a reward. In the Time Attack Mode you can fight against
the computer in a single battle. In the VS Battle Mode you can fight
against an equal character. In the Records Menu you can see the highscores
or send them to the webserver of The Real Ologram
(<A HREF="http://www.ologram.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.ologram.com</A>).
There you can access the highscore lists. In addition there are various
options like auto save, music, SoundFX, that make the game nicer.
</P>
<P>
But now to the game: OloFight is quite good to play, but you have to get
some use to the controls. Before you use the Story mode you should do
some experiments in the VS- or Single Battle Mode, because due to the very
intelligent collision detection you have to do precise hits to wound the
opponent. If you got use to the controls and are able to use the
special moves you should enter the Story Mode. You might notice, that
the computer is quite strong even in the first rounds. This is why you need
the training. Unfortunately I had to notice, that there were some short
stutters during the game, which shoul not happen at the promissed 25 fps.

Conclusion: The graphic is fine. Rendered fighters, more than 3,000 colours,
realistic shadows make it complete. The music is entertaining and mostly
fits to the action of the game. The SoundFX are good. The design is fine,
especially the lots of extra goodies make a difference. The technic is
not so satisfying, but it is in the middle class. The fun of the game
is disturbed mostly due to the stutters and the a bit to hard computer
opponents. A 2 player mode would have been fine, too.
