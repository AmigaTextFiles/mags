<H3>8. Petro Tyschtschenko's Visit to Australia now includes Melbourne</H3>


From: <A HREF="mailto:cyberwlf@wr.com.au">Guy Nathan</A>, Promoter for Sydney/Australian Visit<BR><BR><BR>

Australia -  22 December 1998<BR><BR>

Contact/Reply to: <A HREF="mailto:flinter@tpg.com.au">Basil Flinter</A><BR><BR>

With Petro Tyschtschenko's visit fast approaching, the Melbourne Amiga
community will be pleased to know that Petro Tyschtschenko will now
be including Melbourne in his itinerary during his upcoming visit to
Australia in January 1999.<BR><BR>

Mr Tyschtschenko will be in Melbourne on Mon 11 and Tue 12 January,
and as is the case for Perth and Sydney, there will be an opportunity
to meet him while he is there.<BR><BR>

Persons wishing to meet Petro Tyschtschenko in Melbourne, should send
an email to the contact address above, with: `Petro Visit Melbourne'
as the Subject.<BR><BR>

Then, in the body of the email, they should give some background
information about themselves, as well as any comments that they may
care to make relating to the Amiga's future in Australasia.<BR><BR>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have
already emailed me, even if it's only been to make their views known.<BR><BR>

Your response to these postings can only show that the Amiga still
has strong support in Australasia, and should send a strong message
to Petro Tyschtschenko and Amiga Inc. that they should do something
about it.<BR><BR>
