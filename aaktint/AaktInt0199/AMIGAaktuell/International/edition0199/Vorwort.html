Welcome to the first edition of AMIGA aktuell international this year and to the first
international version.
</P>
<P>
<B>Pre-Preface</B>
<BR><BR>
Basically the international version is a translation of the German version,
but some articles of German interest only have been remove and, if possible,
replaced by articles of international interest. AMIGA aktuell international
will be available approx. two weeks after AMIGA aktuell. So, I hope you
have fun with AMIGA aktuell international.<BR><BR>
And now our editor in chief has the word:
</P>
<P>
This time you have to be satisfied with a quite lean edition. It seems that
after the &quot;headline month&quot; November the firms, developers and
users have to regain strength... Maybe this was the silence before a new
storm. Maybe, and that is more likely, it is just the X-mas month December.
</P>
<P>
At least one theme played a major part in December: 3D! And there were
three major events to happen:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> The release of BVisionPPC, a graphics board with the 3D-chip Permedia2
</LI>
<LI> the announcement of Village Tronic, to bring a 3DFX add-on for the
graphics board Picasso IV on the market, soon
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
and last, but not least
</P>
<UL>
<LI> the release of Warp3D, a driver system for 3D hardware. Even in this
moment a number of game developers announced their support, which means
the breakthrough for 3D hardware for the Amiga is not far away.

<UL>
<LI> It is the time again, to appeal to you, to help us with AMIGA aktuell international.
We try to make a magazine as good as possible, each month. But if each of
you, who could help us would help us, AMIGA aktuell international would be larger and
better. There are more than enough areas of responsability. For example,
the number of tests of commercial products isn't satisfactory at all.
Each month there are new applications and hardware products, and it's
proven they are bought by one or the other AMIGA aktuell international-reader. Is it
too much work to write a test report? You don't do a favor just to the
other readers and us, but you could find your article in one of the
most-read Amiga news magazines.
</LI>
<LI> Ralf Kaiser wants to have a test &quot;Linux for Amiga&quot;. Who is interested in
doing this test? Meanwhile Schatztruhe GbmH released a new Linux-CD.
  eine neue Linux-CD herausgebracht.

<LI> We are looking for someone, who wants to do his/her own AMIGA aktuell international
column, that informs about software updates. Each month there are new
revisions for countless FD and commercial AMIGA programs. This new column
should list the most important improvements of new software updates.<BR>
Who is interested in, to do that?
</LI>
<LI> We are still looking for testers of freely distributable software.
Everybody who wants to do this job is filled into a special distribution
list, and gets ideas for tests in unregular intervals. You aren' obliged
to perform the tests.
<P>
  Of course, we are happy about tests of commercial products as well.

<LI> We repeatedly receive request from foreign countries, if there isn't an
  english version of AMIGA aktuell international. Now there is! (you read it, you know ;-)
  If you discover any errors, please write to <A HREF="mailto:M.Henke@lycosmail.com">Martin Henke</A>
