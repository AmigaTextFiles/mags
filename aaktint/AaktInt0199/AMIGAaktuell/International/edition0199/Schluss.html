<P>
At least in German television they reported about the Amiga in the last
weeks. Especially the shows 'Neues...' and the 'ComputerNacht' are to
be named here, even if the Amiga-theme was in the 'ComputerNacht' just
approx. 2 minutes long, which isn't much, if you consider the length of
the show, which was nearly 7 hours without interrupts(!).
</P>
<P>
Our platform needs good reports in the mass media, urgent. 'Unfortunately'
I nearly have to say, because this results in the bad Amiga situation.
</P>
<P>
Amiga, Inc. and Amiga International cannot make commercials and public
relations - and that's understandable: What is the use to do comercials
for a six year old computer, which is competitive to a Wintel-PC as the
old Volkswagen Beetle is to the New Beetle? That would be squandered money.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact that reports about the Amiga are a kind of commercial this
must not be missing in the future. So it is important, that we - the Amiga
users write more often to newsrooms of computer shows, no matter if in
television or radio or internet services. You should point out that there
are new hardware as well as software developments.
</P>
<P>
I agree, that a single mail of this kind is quite useless, but dozens of
them which contain all the same request:'Tell us more about the Amiga!'
can be quite effective. The few minutes you need to write a letter and
to post it everybody should be willing to do this. Remember: You don't
do this for yourself alone, but for all the others who are interested
in the well-being of the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
See you next month!
</P>
<P>
Truly yours,
