<H3>15. Amiga Informer merges with Amazing Computing/Amiga</H3>

<!--HTML Markup By CUCUG, Please give credit!-->

Joint Press Release from Eldritch Enterprises and PiM Publications,
January 5, 1999.

<P>PiM Publications, publishers of <A HREF="http://www.pimpub.com/">Amazing Computing/Amiga</a>, and Eldritch
enterprises, publishers of <A HREF="http://www.amigainformer.com/">The Amiga Informer</a>, are proud to announce that
they have combined their efforts into one publication. This magazine will
maintain the Amazing Computing/Amiga title and continue to be distributed
through PiM Publications. Fletcher Haug, the Editor-in-chief of The Amiga
Informer, will join the staff of Amazing and bring with him many of the
resources from The Informer. "It is vital that the Amiga community retain
a print publication in North America," said Haug. "By combining the
efforts of The Informer and Amazing, I feel we will be able to give our
readers and the community a stronger publication that combines the best
qualities of both magazines. I am looking forward to working with PiM
Publications on this project."

<P>Since North America was served by Amazing Computing/Amiga and The
Amiga Informer, both magazines were in competition for the same
advertising dollars and subscribers. In recent months, it has become clear
the North American Amiga would benefit from a single newsstand distributed
publication. "These are critical times for the Amiga marketplace as Amiga
Inc. prepares the Next Generation Amiga and OS 3.5 remains in
development," stated Amazing's Managing Editor, Don Hicks. "We believe the
best way to serve this industry is to combine our efforts and build a
stronger communication network from the two publications. With this
alliance, we can offer Amiga vendors an unparalleled opportunity to the
Amiga marketplace in North America while giving our readers the best
possible service."

<P>The Amiga Informer magazine was launched in April, 1996 and grew to be a
respected publication providing Amigans with insightful information and
news compiled by freelance authors worldwide. Issue 17 of The Amiga
Informer was recently released and it will be the last issue printed. As
part of the arrangement between Amazing and The Informer, PiM Publications
will fulfill any outstanding subscriptions from The Informer with issues
of Amazing Computing/Amiga. Eldritch Enterprises closed as a business,
effective December 31, 1998. Further information will soon become
available at The Amiga Informer website (<A HREF="http://www.amigainformer.com/">http://www.amigainformer.com/</A>) and the
Amazing Computing website (<A HREF="http://www.pimpub.com/">http://www.pimpub.com/</A>).

<P>Amazing Computing/Amiga was the world's first monthly Amiga magazine
and remains the longest running Amiga publication. For over 13 years, AC
has provided the Amiga community with balanced, thoughtful reporting on
the Amiga market. The AC staff has also been instrumental in providing
video tapes and transcripts of the major events in the Amiga community.
With the combined efforts of Amazing's Amazing Authors and The Amiga
Informer's quality staff, the Amiga community has an opportunity to build
an even better future publication.

<P>We hope that the combining of Amazing Computing/Amiga and The Amiga
Informer will prove to make a stronger publication that can continue to
serve the Amiga community and carry it to the next level of Amiga
computing. With the combined efforts of both magazines' staff focused in
the same direction, we believe that the community will be better served
and will continue to get the information it needs to move forward to the
future.


<P>Sincerely,

<P>Fletcher Haug, The Amiga Informer Magazine

<P>Don Hicks, Amazing Computing/Amiga
