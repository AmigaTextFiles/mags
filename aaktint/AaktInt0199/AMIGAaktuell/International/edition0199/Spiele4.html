<LI> Blittersoft wants to release FUBAR
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Blittersoft took FUBAR, which is developed by Q-Software, under licence.
The war simulation FUBAR could become a megahit according to its features.
According to the developers you are able to play it with up to 16 computer
or human players. Even playing using the Internet may be possible. With
its modularity you can easily build and use your own levels and graphics, etc.
In addition there are FMV sequences as well as audio tracks by an English band.
The game requires AGA, at least a 030 processor, 20 MB of free hard disk space
and lots of Fast RAM. AHI and PPC are supported, of course.

<P>
<A HREF="img/wildtracks.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/wildtracks.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="87" ALT="Screenshot" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></A>
It seems that DeepCore Entertainment has big plans, because they work on
WildTracks, which is expected to be better (!!) than Need for Speed 3
according to their statements. The game will be released for 68k and,
of course, for PPC. But even, if the game runs on an 68030 with 50 MHz,
the real fun is with an 060 and graphics board. Then you can expect
25 fps. The PPC version will have higher requirements: 603e/200 MHz,
32 MB of RAM, 8x CD-ROM are the minimum. Permedia2 is to be supported as well.
A demo is to be published on X-mas. Further they work on a pinball game,
called Pinball Pro. It is an extended Pinball Dreams. By the way: The game
Total Construction, which was announced last year, will not be released.

</UL>
<P>
In an IRC conference Digital Images confirmed, that they got the complete
source of WipeOut2097 including all additional files. There are 21 (!!) people
in the Digital Images team, and 3 work on the WipeOut2097 port. It is said,
that the ADoom programmer also works for Digital Images. WipeOut2097 will
be released for PPC only.
</P>
<P>
AGA and graphics board are supported. They are in contact with Haage &amp;
Partner. So it is most like that it will support Warp3D. A demo is to be
published early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
They plan to build-in some extras, that did not exist either in the PC-
nor in the PSX version. In addition Digital Images works on the controversial
Space Station 3000, a 3D soccer game and a Tekken clone.

<LI> Titan Computer IRC conference - Soon Settlers III?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Also Titan Computer was on an IRC conference in December. They were
represented by the founder Michael Garlich, the programmer of Claws of
the Devil, Alan Deising, as well as the programmer of Settlers II, Michael
Siegel. Titan got it straight, that Claws of the Devil ran only on an
68060, on the Computer '98 show. So PPC users can relax. Titan Computer
wants to start a test with Settlers II, to find out, if lavish produced
games are still of financial interest. If the game is well sold, there
are no problems for a Settlers III port. At the same time they mentioned,
that the Amiga has no lack of users, but on potencial customers. This was
made clear by Michael Garlich with the situation in Italy. They sold
19 (!!) copies of Shadow of the 3rd Moon, but they got 100 messages of
Shadow of the 3rd Moon 'users'. But they work on a Shadow of the 3rd Moon 2
release, anyway. Titan Computer plans further ports, if the sales are
good enough. Settlers II is to be published in the end of February and
Claws of the Devil in the end of March. It is uncertain, if Warp3D will
be supported.

<LI> Warp3D Version released by ADescent
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
As announced, a Warp3D supporting version of ADescent was published
at the same time as Warp3D. The strongly optimized version is said to
be considerable faster than the normal ADescent version. In Aminet ADescent
is under /game/shoot/ADescent0x0-08.lha, approx. 315 KB.
