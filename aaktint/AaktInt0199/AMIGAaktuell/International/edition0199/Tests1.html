<H3>1. Software test: Personal organizer FiloFax Pro (by Uwe Pannecke)</H3>
<P>
&raquo;You forgot a date again? This is over from now on!
</P>
<P>
AmigaFiloFax Professional - the personal organizer for the AMIGA
</P>
<P>
Even the Amiga user has a lot of dates to think of each day and
it happens often enough that someone forgets a very important date.
Then the girlfriend's or friend's face fell due to the forgotten
appointment or the pizza you put into the oven turns to coal or the
rich aunt waits for a birthday card you wait for the money, or, or, ...
To avoid these daily small catastrophes it makes sense to use a
personal organizer. Of course, the stressed Amigian can use a paper
organizer or buy a Pentium with at least 450 MHz, but not everybody
likes sacrileges and might better use the Amiga. :))
From the many personal organizers in Aminet I chose the shareware
program AmigaFiloFax Professional (later call AFiloFax) by Frank Weber
and tested it.
</P>
<P>
AFiloFax needs in addition to the Amiga operating system the MUI package
and the Reqtools.library. But nearly every Amiga should be equipped with
these additional and necessary program packages.
</P>
<P>
But safety comes first and so AFiloFax carries the Reqtools.library
with it.
</P>
<P>
AFiloFax was tested on an A3000 with 12 MB of RAM and an 040/40 processor
under CyberGfx 3.x and MUI 3.8.
</P>
<P>
Installation
</P>
<P>
The installation is made easy by the installer. During the installation
AFiloFax goes with the necessary data to an own directory on a hard disk
(partition) of your choice, AFiloCron usually in the WBStartup drawer and,
if necessary, the Reqtools.library to LIBS:.
</P>
<P>
In addition the program creates necessary files in S: and ENV:.
</P>
<P>
After a shor time AFiloFax is ready for use.
</P>
<P>
In addition there are various AFFxxSupport.lha packages in Aminet,
which contain a program documentation in HTML format, various additional
samples (sound files) for making the date reminds nicer.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/AFiloFax_01.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AFiloFax_01.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="92" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
In the shareware version AFiloCron ends the program after 30 minutes and
you can use the program for just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
If you pay 25,-- DM (approx. 12.80 Euro; remark of the editors) to the
program author you get a key file and are able to use the program without
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Using the program
</P>
<P>
If AFiloCron is activated after double clicking with the mouse or rebooting
it opens a small window on the Workbench
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/AFiloFax_02.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AFiloFax_02.jpg" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
and you are able to call the different program functions. First it is
necessary to feed AFiloFax with all the dates you might not forget.
AFiloFax offers many possibilities for the date creation.
</P>
<P>
The time intervals can be defined extremely flexible:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>       Once: The date is being deleted after appearing once.
</LI>
<LI>     Always: The date is always displayed, if fits to the defined
		 date/time (usable with variables &quot;*&quot;).
</LI>
<LI>      Daily: The date can be showed once per day.
</LI>
<LI>     Weekly: The date can be showed once per week.
</LI>
<LI> Each month: The date can be showed once per month.
</LI>
<LI>  Each year: The date can be showed once per year.
</LI>
<LI>     Reboot: The date can be showed after a reboot, only.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
When using variables (the *) any date you can think of is selectable.
</P>
<P>
But you should keep in mind, that reminding for the birthday card at
the birthday could be too late, because you need at least a day for
the mail, so it might be usful the be reminded before the date. Of course,
you can consider this when editing the dates and you &quot;bring the birthday
forward&quot;. But it was be more elegant, if the program considered this.
The author held out the prospect of such an add-on.
</P>
<P>
The desired action can be a requester with a chosen text when reaching a date.

</P>
<P>
If you like you can hear a sound sample or use an AmigaDOS command, which
starts e.g. an external program. There aren't nearly any frontiers
for your like of experimenting and phantasy (e.g. remote controlling a
backup program)

or getting the eMails automatically at defined times, or ...).
</P>
<P>
In addition to reminding the dates AFiloFax offers an interval function
and a short time reminder, which reminds you in regular time intervals,
e.g. to make your girl-friend know you live when giving her a kiss or
to pause after sitting in front of your Amiga for hours.

<P>
In addition to this the AFiloCron window offers the selection of a notepad
which makes you easily write any text entries (web addresses, telephone
numbers, ideas). These notes are stored for later use automatically.

And those of you who always wanted to know how long he sat at his computer
per day/month/year, how often and when he booted his computer in this time
should take a look to the statistic functions of AFiloFax.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion
</P>
<P>
To each Amiga user, who uses his computer (nearly) daily and doesn't want
to miss a date I can recommend AFiloFax.
</P>
<P>
The program works reliable (tested in those many 30 test minutes intervals
of the shareware version) and nearly without noticing it in the background
and saves the system recources.
</P>
<P>
The program documentation is very well designed and makes the configuration
of the program in cooperation with the intuitive GUI a child's play.
</P>
<P>
With AFiloFax Frank Weber made a fine package. In my opinion it is worth
its relative high shareware fee.
</P>
<P>
You find the program and its additional files in Aminet and on the
Aminet-CDs under
</P>
<P>
util/time/AFiloFaxProxx.lha (while testing the actual revision was FiloFaxPro28.lha)
util/time/AFFxxSupport.lha (the actual revision of this also was AFF28Support.lha).
