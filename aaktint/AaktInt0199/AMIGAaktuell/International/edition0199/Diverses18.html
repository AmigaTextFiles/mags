<!--HTML Markup By CUCUG, Please give credit!-->
<P>After the phenomenal success of their previous sale, the <A HREF="http://www.furry.demon.co.uk/kickstart/index.html">Kickstart
User Group</a>, based in Ottershaw, Surrey have announced the date for
their second Kickstart Amiga Show.
<PRE>     The Place: Brook Hall, Brox Road, Ottershaw in Surrey
      The Date: Saturday February 27th 1999
      The Time: 1pm-5pm
 Admission fee: £1
</PRE>
<P>Amiga International are officially supporting this year's show, and
Petro Tyschtschenko has kindly donated a complete A1200 Magic Pack
along with an assortment of Amiga goodies (stickers, badges, mice,
mouse mats etc.) all of which will be given away to show goers
throughout the day.
<P>The show will consist of a sale of Amiga hardware and software, games
competitions throughout the day, demonstrations of Amiga applications
and new hardware and the opportunity to join the Kickstart User Group.
In all it's a great day out where you can have fun, get help with your
Amiga problems and meet other Amiga users.
<P>What's on at the show:
<P>The second Kickstart Show will be bursting with even more Amiga
activities than last year, showing both Amiga owners and their friends
exactly what Amiga can REALLY do:
<P>Stands: 18 stands selling new and second-user Amiga software and
hardware. Refreshments will also be on sale and a Kickstart membership
stand will also be on hand to answer questions and handle membership
enquiries from show-goers.
<P>Competitions: Amiga International are supporting the show by offering
a complete A1200 Magic Pack (worth #200) for the grand draw, which
each show-goer is automatically entered into. There will also be
various Amiga give-aways throughout the day and great prizes for the
various gaming contests planned.
<P>Games: Three gaming competitions are planned: A multiplayer Doom
tournament (with as many as five simultaneous players in each game), A
Sensible Soccer tournament and a Skidmarks contest (with as many as
eight simultaneous players in each game).
<P>Demonstrations: Kickstart members will be on hand to demonstrate
various applications, such as Mac emulation under Fusion, PC Emulation
under PCX and Amiga emulation using Amiga Forever. Also on show will
be new hardware innovations, such as the AteoBus busboard and Pixel64
graphics card and various A1200 & A600 tower conversions.
<P>Magazine launch: Being unveiled at the Kickstart Show will be the
first issue of the new monthly Kickstart magazine Amiga Insight. This
magazine, produced totally by club members on Amiga hardware, will
have a monthly mix of news, product reviews, tutorials and informed
debate about the latest Amiga topics - indeed everything from the fate
of OS3.5 to why 880K floppy disks should be killed off!
<P>For show enquiries and stand bookings, please contact <A HREF="mailto:rob@gilbie.freeserve.co.uk">Rob Gilbert</a>
