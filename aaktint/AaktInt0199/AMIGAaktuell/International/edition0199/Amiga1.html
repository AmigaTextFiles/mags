<H3>1. Mystery of 'MMC' manufacturer solved?</H3>
<P>
The mystery of the manufacturer of the so-called 'MMC' media processor,
that is expected to be used in the next-generation-Amiga is most likely
to be solved: With reference to Amiga International, Inc. a user reported
in a public Amiga forum, that the firm was bought by the canadian graphic
hardware manufacturer ATI, recently. If this is true the only conclusion is
that the manufacturer of the 'MMC' is Chromatic Research 
(<A HREF="http://www.chromatic.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.chromatic.com</A>),
ATI bought in November 1998. Even months ago Chroatic Research was named
as manufacturer of the 'MMC', but only in rumours. More detailed informations
to the mediaprocessor MPact are available under <A HREF="http://www.mpact.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.mpact.com</A>.
</P>
<P>
It is not certain, if Amiga, Inc. is going to use the technology of Chromatic
Research after ATI bought it. But at least they do not commit on this, but
develop the new AmigaOS hardware indipendent.
</P>
<P>
Here are three press releases regarding the buying of Chromatic Research by ATI:
