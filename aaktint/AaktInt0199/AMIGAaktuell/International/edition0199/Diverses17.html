<H3>17. Warp3D support of 3DFX hardware</H3>
<P>

&raquo;Warp3D support of 3DFX-Hardware<BR>
Shortly before the Computer 98 in Cologne, VillageTronic announced an add-on<BR>
board for their PicassoIV graphics board, consisting of a Voodoo 3D hardware<BR>
accelerator. To justify development, they need a certain amount of preorders.<BR>
3DFX's Voodoo chip set has set new standards in 3D accelerators in both<BR>
Performance and features. For a long period, it was the reference platform<BR>
for 3D hardware until surpassed by it's own successor.<BR>
For an application to use these features, an application programmer's<BR>
interface is required. This is the Warp3D project's main goal. It does this<BR>
by supplying a hardware independent API. To run applications supporting the<BR>
Warp3D API on a new hardware, a new driver must be written for that hardware.<BR>
We would like to emphasize that a Warp3D driver will be available as soon as<BR>
the Voodoo board is released. That way, the ridiculous situation of a 3D<BR>
hardware being available without driver support would be prevented. Every<BR>
Warp3D application will support the hardware, making a lot of programs<BR>
readily available. This includes OpenGL applications, which will<BR>
automatically work on every 3D hardware.<BR>
The development of a Warp3D Voodoo driver is very easy, because there's<BR>
already an existing hardware abstraction layer (Glide). The only thing to do<BR>
is to map Warp3D functions to Glide functions, a job that can be achieved<BR>
very easily. The Voodoo hardware has nearly all the features needed by<BR>
OpenGL, which would be very interesting to people wanting to use OpenGL in<BR>
future work.<BR>
This combination of top hardware and high power driver system would bring the<BR>
Amiga a big step forward in the games market, there could be games running at<BR>
speeds unimaginable on current Amigas, not even with he fastest processors<BR>
available. The slow bus system is still the bottleneck, and with the Voodoo<BR>
hardware, this can be bypassed.<BR>
All this could soon be reality, the only thing that could still prevent it<BR>
would be a lack of interest, resulting in too few preorders. We want to<BR>
encourage people thinking about getting such a board to preorder it *now*.<BR>
Time is of the essence! More orders are required and the time of decision is<BR>
drawing near.<BR>
We think this project to be very important for the future of games<BR>
development on the Amiga. If the project should fail, the chances for special<BR>
3d hardware optimized games will be very small, because the Permedia2 will be<BR>
available for really fast games, and the CyberVisionPPC can not be used with<BR>
turbo boards from other manufacturers. The ViRGE used on the CyberVision3D<BR>
can be used for low resolution games, but will not be able to handle e.g.<BR>
OpenGL-based games.<BR>
Due to the slow bus transfer speed, it will not be possible to have fast<BR>
games in high resolutions running at acceptable frame rates. For a resolution<BR>
of 640*480*15, considered low end on other systems, a frame rate of about 10<BR>
frames, probably less on complex scenery, is the expected maximum on an Amiga<BR>
without 3d hardware. Even a fast CPU is not that important, the bottleneck is<BR>
the graphics boards bus. A CPU that's twice as fast will not accelerate a<BR>
game by factor two, probably only by 1.5, or even less in high resolutions.<BR>
On an Amiga, 3d hardware will have more impact than on other systems.<BR>
Without 3d hardware, overall graphics quality is much lower, because software<BR>
rendering can't use all of the effects available to 3d hardware, including:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Bilinear filtering</LI>
<LI> Mipmapping with trilinear filtering</LI>
<LI> Antialiasing</LI>
<LI> Transparency</LI>
</UL>
VillageTronics project can be called a real chance and will sure be a measure<BR>
for everything that's to be expected in the future. Now, a decision is if the<BR>
Amiga market is ready for keeping up with the current technology. If the<BR>
project should fail, games development on the Amiga will no longer be viable<BR>
in the long run, because 3d games are the current trend in the games<BR>
industry, and porting these to the Amiga will not be possible anymore. Fast<BR>
3d hardware is to software like the fastest PowerPCs to the 68020.<BR>
Currently, there are some game projects that will support Warp3D, and more<BR>
are announced. These games require 3d hardware. Many of these projects will<BR>
fail if the Voodoo project fails.<BR>
A list of projects supporting Warp3D will be available on the Warp3D webpages<BR>
as soon as possible.<BR>
To all of you who have not yet decided to preorder, do it now. You'll do the<BR>
Amiga a great favor, and you'll experience ultra-fast, high quality 3D<BR>
graphics.<BR>
