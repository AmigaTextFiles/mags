<H3>4. Free UK Amiga Internet Access</H3>
<HR>
If you live in the UK you may be aware that Dixons, the high street electrical retail chain, have setup a free ISP service.
<BR>
The service is called <A HREF ="http://www.freeserve.net"> Freeserve </A>and is aimed at PC owners who wish to get on the net.<BR>
<HR>
<H2>So how do you get this on your Amiga ?</H2>
<BR>
Firstly you need the <Strong>FREE</Strong> CD from Dixons, Currys, PC-World or The Link.<BR>
Just pop into one of their branches and ask for the Freeserve connection CD-ROM.<BR>
<BR>
The next step is to set up your account, the only way to do this at present is on-line, hence your going to need access to a PC with Win95 and a modem.<BR>
Just ask a friend to back up their settings so you can set up your account on their PC!<BR>
<HR>
Have a notepad handy as you will need to jot down your settings as these will be needed again later on.<BR>
<HR>
Run the Freeserve CD on the PC and the first thing you will need to fill in is a questionaire but remember to check the box in the bottom right hand corner<BR>
Next you need to select a node name and a password.<BR>
For the purpose of this document I shall use an example to guide you through.<BR>
<BR>
Lets say you want you site to be called Amiga1.<BR>
<BR>
Type your nodename in as Amiga1, if it has been used already you will be asked to select another.<BR>
Next think of a password and write these two pieces of information down.<BR>
Just to recall and remember internet passwords are case sensitive:<HR>
Nodename:       Amiga1<BR>
Password:       abc123<HR>
OK so your now need to select your email address this will probibly be in the format shown below.<BR>
<BR>Yourname@Amiga1.freeserve.co.uk<BR>
<HR>
<H2>Amiga Setup</H2>
<BR>
All the software you need is on various CU-Amiga (RIP) and Amiga-Format Cover CD's.<BR>
This example uses the excellent Miami TCP/IP stack.<BR>
Install Miami on your Amiga as explained in its doc files.<BR>
Install a web browser on your Amiga, personally I recommend IBrowse.<BR>
Install YAM on your Amiga.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You are now ready to begin configuring the Amiga programs to your Freeserve account.<BR>
<HR>
<H2>Miami Settings</H2>
