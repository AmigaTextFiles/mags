<P>
The word &quot;Innovation&quot; is quite nice. Many companies dress up with this word and don't get tired of telling the
customer, how stupid and short sighted he (the customer) was, if he did not decide for the plugged product.
</P>
<P>
This battle is in the future of the Amiga users. Amiga cut themselves off and are no longer going to publish any more
Executive Updates.
</P>
<P>
Is someone getting queasy? Well, the fright of the Amiga leaders is understandable. Those who kept their eyes open and
fallowed the last weeks press and watches other computer systems will find out, that Amiga is not the only pioneer of
the multimedia age.
</P>
<P>
The IFA in Berling, Germany shows the masses of multimedial devices rolling towards us in the next months. Each manufacturer
promisses never expected possibilities with the medium Internet ... TV, radio and the classic buying are just some of the
new catchwords.
</P>
<P>
The question is:
Which application areas, except the gighly praised &quot;network abilities&quot; and the &quot;revolutionary graphic
solutions&quot; is the future Amiga user to cover with the magic machine? The application areas for computer changed
quite a lot during the last years. Not only freaks are in front of the box, but also pseudo-computer-professionals
(&quot;To open a new document you have to click on -New-...&quot;).
</P>
<P>
As a freak for a long time there is melancholy about the past days. Maybe the discussion should start, which special
profiles, which image the community wants to get in the next time.
</P>
<P>
Jesco v. Puttkamer (NASA employee; and others are responsible for building the space station ISS and planned Mars flights)
recently said in an interview, that the community needs a vision for space travelling. Only that way, the young ones can
get a perspective and start the future with a target in front of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is also time for the computer sector to claim targets for the future. Only that way a product and the desired
community can be further developped; the reference to the Internet seems to be too little...
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosper...
