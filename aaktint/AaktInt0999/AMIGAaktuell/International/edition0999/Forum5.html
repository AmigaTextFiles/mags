5. Letter to the Editor about Future of Amiga (by Stefano Pucino)<BR>
</P><P>
»Hi, again I was readin through the web and your mag when an idea bolted<BR>
to my mind. Would it be an outlook to the AmigaNG future to come ??? ;-))<BR>
</P><P>
The rage to write overcame me and I could not stop it. ;)<BR>
</P><P>
At first a teenyweeny criticizm about Dr. Rick LeFaivre and Dr. Allan<BR>
Havemose.<BR>
Attention: I proceed directly to my own text ;-))<BR>
</P><P>
In the article in 08/99 I read the following line:<BR>
</P><P>
"DON'T JUST FOCUS ON BOXES AND OPERATING SYSTEMS!"<BR>
</P><P>
Well, I'd like to look at something else, but at WHAT? Since YEARS we<BR>
are waiting that so many promises are kept (Triple-A 'AAA' chip set, PPC<BR>
Amigas ...), which non of them where fulfilled. Now again they promise us<BR>
the surprise of a lifetime, but the PC industry is some more powerful<BR>
than the last time rival Atari.<BR>
</P><P>
Amiga Inc. MUST install something revolutionary. Something, that makes the<BR>
Amiga to what it was: "revolution-ary". ;)<BR>
</P><P>
By that time the step from 8 bit to 16 bit really was revolutionary.<BR>
Multitasking, 4096 colors and an 8 bit stereo digital sound were for 8 bit<BR>
enthusiasts (C64, Amstrad-CPC, Spectrum) a true challenge. Over years PC's<BR>
were only good for work and Amigas for fun. Today the stakes have changed:<BR>
PC transformed to the most expensive (P)layer (C)onsole in the market and<BR>
the Amiga can survive only with help of the 'community'. A few great <BR>
applications still exist. The 'market' consists actually just of very<BR>
able (shareware) programmers. The PC-market flourishes. Any software is<BR>
supplied on CD, even if it just a birthday greeting ..., a 400MB programm<BR>
on the harddisk cares for the last salute.<BR>
</P><P>
'We' amigans extemporize where ever possible and do by witchcraft beautiful<BR>
things without enforcing uncountable MBs.<BR>
</P><P>
But ... The Amiga has even MORE power. It is not just a motherboard with<BR>
a BIOS, but an entire philosophy. A computer, which is to simplify the<BR>
work with a computer.<BR>
</P><P>
Micro$oft gains speed. Out of a single task DOS environment really became<BR>
GUI surface ;-))<BR>
The problem herewith ... infinite unoptimized routines of uncountable<BR>
programmers, GUIs with obstinate functions and unlogical plays.<BR>
</P><P>
There seems to apply the rule: "Filch everything, improve nothing!"<BR>
</P><P>
The best example: The registry!<BR>
</P><P>
The Macintosh boasts a perfect registry. In "case of emergency" you just<BR>
delete the file and the OS builds up a new registy. Quick, clean and<BR>
efficient!<BR>
WARNING: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME! The PC does NOT do this!<BR>
For this the programmers of the Wi(n)dows software take cars of. They<BR>
play around in the system in a way, that Windows has to be installed<BR>
anew every 6 month.<BR>
Frightening! The Joe Doe normal user does not simply use the computer<BR>
for his work, but has additionally to study Informatics to understand the<BR>
operating system and the registry. Gone away the days, when you had to<BR>
switch on the power to access everything.<BR>
</P><P>
Linux is a beautiful and stable alternative. But I, who startet to program<BR>
with an Atari 2600 with film keyboard and 1kB, gave up with Linux!<BR>
</P><P>
I must have been happy, that my PC recognized the Linux-CD at all. ;)<BR>
 <BR>
"Luke ... my son ... who rulez Linux, he has the force."<BR>
</P><P>
However Linux has something instead, what Windows never will have: Open<BR>
Source of the best! Not the smoked up programmer in the Micro$oft dungeon<BR>
checks its code, but millions of programmers optimize any single code<BR>
of the OS!<BR>
</P><P>
And my imaginations of the future?<BR>
</P><P>
At one day there will be a computer, which carries on the old philosophy<BR>
of Amiga. The simple usability, unbeaten multimedia power and the right<BR>
idea at the right time. But how to get it whithout stealing?<BR>
</P><P>
Long time ago Phase-5 promised us an AOX, a computer with true multimedia<BR>
power. Sorry, it never was manufactured. And again some time later a<BR>
planned but never made computer named Prebox followed. Maybe it would<BR>
have become the first multi processor Amiga. who knows ...<BR>
</P><P>
In the time before, in between or after a real computer appeared on the<BR>
Amiga market and was called "Draco". Good video system, but rarely to find<BR>
in a household. The C64 had had a better success. And now, shortly after<BR>
release of the Technology Letter of Amiga Inc., again a new computer is<BR>
planned. Hey, what are we up to!? Grow computers on trees nowadays ??? ;-)<BR>
</P><P>
The introduction of the custom chips like Paula and Denise opened a new<BR>
16 bit future. PC's of today have enough power, but since years the users<BR>
cry for new standards to make forget the annoying IRQ problems and slow<BR>
bus-IOs. Autoconfig was known to us a decade before Bill Gates presented<BR>
"his revolution" in Wi(n)dows 95 for the first time to the public. In<BR>
the field of PC the M$ operating system may be a little revolution, but<BR>
in the main range of computers it is just another failed attempt. Even<BR>
the completely new USB with its clear standard is in the most expensive<BR>
Windows worsely implemented than in the smallest iMac. The Computer-Club<BR>
in WDR (German TV-program), heavyly spoiled by Wintel, reported about<BR>
the failed USB experiment by M$ and the outstanding support on the<BR>
Apple sector.<BR>
</P><P>
Thus technical seen the PC ist todays "standard", but easyly to improve.<BR>
Here the Amiga could install a completely *new* standard. Why should the<BR>
user buy a AS_S PxB board, a Celeron/P-III, a TV board with TV I/O, an<BR>
extern DVD decoder board or an expensive MPEG2 CoDec board and have to<BR>
do all those installation routines, if he can have all this as STANDARD<BR>
and without any complication???<BR>
</P><P>
Will I be able in the future simply to power up the Amiga, choose the<BR>
TV program and save it directly in DVD format? One of the steps into the<BR>
direction "Computer application for everybody". This could be the first<BR>
step to the longly expected DVD recorder. In the Technology Paper is<BR>
written: "Realtime video compression including MPEG2".<BR>
</P><P>
An ATI graphics board with 32 MB would be sufficient for me for 150 years.<BR>
Until today I work with an AGA only computer. ;-)) But I hope, that the<BR>
programmers (of games) do not try the same as with the PC and only scratch<BR>
upon the graphics board instead of using it fully. According to "To slow?<BR>
Go and buy a new one!" :-( Already standard with PC.<BR>
</P><P>
However one or two little games should be possible on the Amiga. As a<BR>
big fan of the "Command & Conquer" series I am looking forward eagerly.<BR>
Because part no. 3 will certainly (!) not run on my old P90 (1MB PCI bus,<BR>
1.x graphics board without 3D!). 1P shooter like "Half-Life" might be<BR>
possible with help of the 3D engine. But console generations to come<BR>
(DreamCast, PSX2, Dolphin) will be much better suited for those games.<BR>
</P><P>
But will I have to buy a 2000+ processor to emulate foreign hardware as<BR>
the emulator addict, that I am? I'd like to enjoy the MAME games. Or (at<BR>
last) run my old Amstrad-CPC in real time in a window, WITHOUT to own<BR>
at least a P-II/300+.<BR>
</P><P>
Wouldn't it be possible to 'emulate' the architecture on the hardware basis?<BR>
A simple upload of the instructions into a buffer of the processor might be<BR>
perfect ;-) Might here be a beginning visible in the Transmeta-CPU??? A<BR>
kind of gigantic DSP unit?<BR>
</P><P>
The use of Java as language could help future Amiga programmers to set foot<BR>
upon other platforms (Linux ;).<BR>
</P><P>
The AmigaOE/AmigaObjects are very interesting features, too. Who doesn't<BR>
know the situation: You have an A4k on your writing-table, aside an A500,<BR>
one A3k in the basement and two A2k under the table. I'm thinking of my<BR>
sysop ;-)) Well, in theory we have several 680x0 processors collecting<BR>
dust in idle mode. An OS distributing its resources via network to the<BR>
several computers would be perfect, when major projects are approaching.<BR>
You might encrease your computing power just by integrating another<BR>
computer into the net. E.g. for presentation it would be a perfect<BR>
start.<BR>
</P><P>
The Java/Jini technologies promised by Amiga Inc. footing upon it could<BR>
finalize the driver pain for once and for all. If all devices internally <BR>
contain a standard driver and it would be downloaded via Jini to the<BR>
system, the most important problem will be solved, or what ? ;-)<BR>
</P><P>
Simply connect a digital camera to the Amiga and the driver imbeds itself<BR>
into the system. Click upon the icon and transfer pictures without ever<BR>
having seen the driver. Gone the nightmare asking manufacturers for <BR>
Amiga drivers.<BR>
</P><P>
The nasty weeping of the Amiga users for the discarded QNX is hardly<BR>
bearable. Okay, QNX offers huge possibilities, but Jim Collas ist right.<BR>
He, who wants to connect big developers to the system must submit to a<BR>
"standard". And let's be honest: would we rather prefer a Micro$oft<BR>
monopol position in the OS??? There you are, let's have good look at the<BR>
future. Will the Amiga  together with the C64 and MAME disappear in an<BR>
UAE invironment on a Wintel machine? :-(((( Or will we move to an AmigaNG/<BR>
AmigaMCC and smile down to a Wintel user, who desperatly tries to install<BR>
Wi(n)dows, after the last database had shot down his config. ;-)<BR>
</P><P>
With Linux we have an open system at our disposal. We have a kernel<BR>
(! KERNEL, not an OS!) with proven stability. A truely gigantic spectrum<BR>
of developements and a new and growing market with lots of surprises.<BR>
</P><P>
QNX has no experiences in this field, but can as well join in. To convince<BR>
other companies (Corel, Adobe, ...) will certainly be more difficult.<BR>
</P><P>
E.g. the art designers best loved baby: Adobe PhotoShop. A real dream for<BR>
the owner of a Macintosh. But why does the deficient Wi..9x get a<BR>
conversion but no attention is paid to the AmigaOS, which is similar to<BR>
the MacOS??? Because there is no future-power in Amiga? No developement<BR>
is warranted and herewith a wider diffusion by up-to-date technology??<BR>
</P><P>
Exactly here (at last?!) a conclusion can be made. Conversion will be<BR>
written in capital letters and will be seriously meant! We will see!<BR>
</P><P>
But QNX should in no case give up!!! Their Neutrino seems to have the<BR>
power of a Linux-II.<BR>
</P><P>
Might they consider an Amiga conversion I shouldn't hesitate to transform<BR>
my programs to QNX immediately. In no way I'd support the 'slaying' of<BR>
other operating systems, which the Redmond enterprise 'succeeded' in!<BR>
There seems to flow to much Amiga blood in my digital veins? ;-))<BR>
</P><P>
I know, I am an incorrigible optimist. But if the promises will come true<BR>
an Jim really presents us a computer for the next millennium I'll not<BR>
hesitate for even 5 seconds and buy it directly out of Jim's hand.<BR>
</P><P>
Otherwise you only can hope, that the Amirage-K2 will occupy the position<BR>
of the Amiga and many conversion to the Linux-similar QNX will follow.<BR>
Because in that case I'll personally tickle Jim Collas to death !!! ;-))<BR>
 <BR>
... may Chris Huelsbeck, Rob Hubbard, Jochen Hippel und Martin<BR>
    Galway never become deaf ...<BR>
</P><P>
</P><P>
Yours<BR>
