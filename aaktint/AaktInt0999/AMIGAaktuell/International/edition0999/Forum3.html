3. Comment to Public Critcisms concerning the AmigaNG (by Gerald Sautner)<BR>
</P><P>
»For myself I cannot quite understand the rejection of the AmigaNG. For<BR>
long six years we are waiting for a new Amiga and now it seems, that lots<BR>
of people refuse it.<BR>
</P><P>
Honestly, I cannot imagine what makes Linux so bad. Yes, I know, it is<BR>
just for insiders. But can you really imagine, that Amiga Inc. might offer<BR>
us the operating system in a way, that the normal user is unable to<BR>
understand it and to attend it? Even to Amiga Inc. it should be clear<BR>
(with all those newly hired specialists), that they could scarcely sell<BR>
such a computer, may it have the best hardware.<BR>
</P><P>
Even if many user had prefered QNX, I believe that the AmigaNG with Linux<BR>
(how it may ever appear) will have more advantages in the market. Will the<BR>
Amiga take hold of the market, then QNX could be adapted to the AmigaNG,<BR>
too. Why shouldn't it be possible to install on a computer with, as I <BR>
understood it, very high hardware power several operating systems?<BR>
</P><P>
As we know, the old software will not work on the new one.<BR>
[Not quite correct, an emulation is planned; editor's note]<BR>
Well, that is a pity, but couldn't it be, that we take a big step ahead?<BR>
I was there, when the change came from C64 to Amiga, no old software was<BR>
usable any more. Looking back, we left the old and received the new and<BR>
certainly better. Couldn't it be, it will turn out the same today? Am I<BR>
completely wrong, if I believe that new possibilities arise by the latest<BR>
developement?<BR>
</P><P>
For the first time in six years there is movement stirring Amiga, Inc.<BR>
Shouldn't we now give Collas and his team a chance? Possibly it is the<BR>
last opportunity for the Amiga to gain a footing on the market.<BR>
