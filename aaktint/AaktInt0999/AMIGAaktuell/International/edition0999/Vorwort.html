+++ JIM COLLAS RESIGNED AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMIGA +++
Successor Tom Schmidt seems to keep the direction of the company +++ Basic changes in information policy announced
</P>
<P>
So far the dramatic headlines, which have been announced on September 1st. Already some days ago on the web site of AMIGA
the new - or better: none at all - information policy - was announced. That this was the decision of a new AMIGA president
no one might have considered for real.

<LI> And again, there are two new section in AMIGA aktuell internation: 'A glimpse ahead' has the technology of the
AmigaNG and the fade from the classic computers to the Amiga of the next generation as a theme; the Technology and
Net NEWS are not limited to the Amiga market, but the complete computer and information technology. Both sections are
done by Thomas Hasemann, which some of you might know from his Amiga times. Well, maybe he might become an Amiga user
again, who knows...
