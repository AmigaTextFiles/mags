<H1>13. Mac corner review: Exile III: Ruined World</H1>
<P>
Only some of might know the third part of the Ultima like Exile series, especially, because it is only distributed as
shareware. But the game has not to be afraid to be compared with commercial products. This is why it is introduced here:
</P>
<P>
The story of Exile II can be shortened to this: In a phantasy world, any inhabitants, that were not liked by the &quot;Empire&quot;
were sent to exile, a gigantic cave system, where there was no escape. The first exile parts explain the battle of the exiled
people with the soldiers of the empire, after a gate to the upper world was created by mighty magicians. With the help of
Vanathai, a nation of magic powers, that lives under the earth, the exiled people managed it to defeat the troups of the
empire. Some years later the story of Exile III begins. After a long time of suffering the magicians of the exiled people
manage it to create a portal, which allows voyages to the upper world, which just known from stories, now. The player gets
into the role of an adventure group, which has the job to explore the upper world and to prepare a settlement by the
exiled people.
</P>
<P>
As already mentioned, the idea of the game is similar to the old Ultima things. It is your job to explore the (gigantic)
world, to talk to other people and to win against the more or less strong monsters and creatures. The special feature is
the total freedom of acting and motion the player has. You might follow the (very good) story - or you explore the gigantic
upper world with hundreds of places and caves. Alternatively you can experience adventures in the underworld or reach the
Tower of the Magicians in the deep.
</P>
<P>
Special praise goes to the completely intuitive point-and-click interface, which is extremely userfriendly. Especially the
talks with other persons are made nice - just a click on a catchword in the speech of the other person is enough to react
on it. Numerous minor stories and little jobs as well as the secret passages and ways, which can be found anywhere, don't
let this game become boring. The graphics is not earth-shaking, but it is quite nice and of professional quality.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact, that the game does not offer graphic orgies and is in addition round and field based, it runs in full
speed and makes you forget, that you play it on an emulator, again. A processor, slower than a 040 should be enough for
this game to play it in a reasonable speed, too.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Because role games are not limited just for the Amiga, everybody who likes this type of game, should catch it.
That the Exile series has been rewarded with some prices of Mac magazines, shows the high Quality of the game. The only
problem is, that the game is not distributed in Germany. Those, who just want to take a look, can download a demo of the
game from <A HREF="http://www.spidweb.com">www.spidweb.com</A> and get an own impression.
