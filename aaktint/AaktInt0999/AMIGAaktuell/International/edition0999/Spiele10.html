<H2>10. Mac corner introduction: Mac games with the Amiga</H2>
<P>
Those, who made a look on other platforms might have noticed, that there is a number of good games, that never found there
way to the Amiga or have been converted in this matter.
</P>
<P>
But the solution of this problem is as easy as it has never been before: Because with an emulator like Fusion or Shapeshifter
you can play the old games for the Mac, that do not need a PPC processor, on your Amiga at home.
</P>
<P>
The things you require for such an emulation is not supposed to be the theme of this article: Who is interested in that,
is supposed to download the freeware version of Shapeshifter from the Aminet or look on one of the Internet pages, which
tell you more about this theme.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of this section is to give you a better impression in the world of Mac games. You might imagine, what
&quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; or &quot;The Settlers II&quot; is, but who knows, what is e.g. &quot;Evocation&quot;,
&quot;Havoc&quot; or &quot;Turbular Worlds&quot;?!
</P>
<P>
However, the test reports are supposed to inform you about the speed of the games on the Mac emulation. Those, who have
been afraid of getting Fusion or Shapeshifter, because they thought, that &quot;it will be slow, anyway&quot; is most
likely wrong with this guess. I also thought so, when I had a &quot;naked&quot; 040/40 (at least it has no graphics board),
when I ordered Fusion - but it was far away from that: the emulation speed is fine, not only with applications, but also with
many games. Often you think, that you're sitting with an old LCIII or another Mac - but just a fast one ;-)
</P>
<P>
Well, the old games can be ordered from various mailing order Mac-dealers - for quite reasonable prices: e.g.

Ach ja, alte Spiele kann man uebrigens noch bei verschiedenen Mac-
Versandhaendlern bestellen - und zwar zu einem sehr vernuenftigen Preis: z.B.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Civilization II   30 DEM (approx. 15.31 Euros)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Kings Quest VII   10 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euros)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Space Quest VI    10 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euros)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In addition there is a &quot;Classic&quot; series put on the market, similar to the Platinum series for the Playstation:
The first game of the series is Worms for 30 DEM (approx. 15.31 Euros); but who needs that, if he can get WormsDC for
his Amiga  :-))
