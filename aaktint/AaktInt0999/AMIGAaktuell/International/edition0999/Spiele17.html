<H1>17. From where can I get games?</H1>
<P>
A theme I want to write about in this edition of the Mac corner is my comment from the last edition, that old Mac games
could be bought from &quot;some&quot; Mac dealers for cheap prices. Well, that seems to be a bit exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
The mangle of the desired mail-ordered business dealers has a good reason, because the Macintosh has never been known as
a game computer. So there are little companies, which put games into their range. That might not just be due to the
high prices for the software of this computer. Costs for 150 DEM (approx. 76.53 Euros) for a new game were not seldom in
the past, but the peak was the recommended retail price for 190 DEM (approx. 96.94 Euros) for Kings Quest VII in a magazine.
Anyone would have laughed about this obvious print error - but with the Mac... ?
</P>
<P>
However, I can recommend three dealers with a clear conscience:

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Playmax&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&quot;www.playmax.de&quot;&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Some games for cheap money&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
But I assume, that there are some other small mail order dealers, which still have one or the other rarity. If you consider,
that there are still some dealers, that offer C64 games. If you know such dealers or other sources of old games (I don't
mean pirate copies), I would be delighted to learn about that.
</P>
<P>
And this is the offer of the month:
</P>
<P>
Those, who like point&amp;click adventures like Monkey Island and has been angry about that LucasArts doesn't publish
games for the Amiga any more, should take a look on the LucasArts bundle, that is e.g. offered by Playmax.
</P>
<P>
This bundle contains:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Full Throttle
</LI>
<BR><LI> Sam &amp; Max
</LI>
<BR><LI> Day of the Tentacle
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
They are all top games, which are a bit older, but they are still as fine as funny as they were when they were released.
Alltogether costs just 99 DEM (approx. 50.51 Euros), including five other games, you could choose from a seperate list.
Such a 6-product-bundle could contain these articles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Lucas-Arts-Bundle
</LI>
<BR><LI> &quot;4 Mega Games&quot; Superspy, Jewels of the Oracle,
		 Total Distortion, Rave Schuttle
</LI>
<BR><LI> Pirates Gold
</LI>
<BR><LI> Kings Quest VII
</LI>
<BR><LI> The last Express
</LI>
<BR><LI> Ultimate Doom
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These are just 9 DEM per game. Who thinks twice about it, makes a fault...
And those, who would like the complete list of possible games should take a look on the Playmax homepage.
