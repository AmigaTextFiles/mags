								<P><FONT face="Arial" color="#aa0000"><B>MAJOR NEWS ABOUT THE SOFTWARE OF THE CYBERSTORM AND BLIZZARD G4 BOARDS - August 04, 99:</B><BR>
								</FONT><FONT face="Arial"><BR>
								After entering a <A href="qnxp5e.html">cooperation agreement with <B>QNX Software Systems Ltd.</B></A>, we are able to ship the new <B>CYBERSTORM</B> and <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> boards with the outstanding operating system <B>QNX Neutrino</B>. As we - together with QSSL - will also make this OS available to all users of existing first-generation, 603 and 604 based PowerPC boards for free, it will be supported by a large number of current Amiga developers very soon, and will be the operating system of choice for several future stand-alone hardware products (from different vendors); thus, the <B>CYBERSTORM</B> and <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> boards with <B>QNX Neutrino OS</B> open up the path to the future. The compatibility with existing applications under AmigaOS 3.x will be maintained by the powerful <A href="legacye.html"><B>AmigaOS Legacy Support</B></A>. With this open and innovative approach, which will also be choosen and support
ed by other vendors, the <B>CYBERSTORM</B> and <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> boards play a leading role in the introduction of a next-generation series of systems and computers of different vendors, among them our own <A href="amiragee.html"><B>AMIRAGE&#153; K2</B></A> computer system.<BR>
								<BR>
								<B>What do these changes mean for the users?</B> <BR>
								It's simple: They bring you more performance, more functionality, and more future - and all that for an even lower price as earlier announced! The <B>CYBERSTORM</B> and <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> boards provide the perfect start for all developers and users into the next technology generation!<BR>
								<BR>
								Additionally, the<B> CYBERSTORM</B> and <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> boards are open systems, which can also be used with different other software solutions. The integrated Flash-ROM offers a boot select menu, from which different system software kernels can be started from the Flash-ROM or from boot partitions on your hard disk (several different boot kernels can be installed parallely). The programming of the Flash-ROM as well as the other hardware functionality is documented, and this is available to developers. That means it is easily possible to install and run other software solutions (such as Warpup or Linux) without using or starting from the <B>QNX Neutrino OS</B> which comes along with the boards.<BR>
								<BR>
								</FONT></P>
								<P><FONT face="Arial" color="#aa0000"><B>UPDATES ON THE HARDWARE CONCEPT - August 04, 99:</B></FONT><FONT face="Arial"><BR>
								<BR>
								A major change of the design of both boards is that we have decided not to integrate SCSI and IEEE-1394 on the products as standard, and therefore reduce the base prices of the products (we will make add-ons available, and have also added other features, as you can read below). We have decided to do this, as we found out that many customers have very different demands. For example, many have been asking for implementation of the U2W SCSI interface &#150; even for the <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> board &#150; which is more expensive and would later also cause significant additional cost to the user in respect to cabling and adaptors. On the other hand, other customers may only want to connect some older legacy SCSI devices and would be happy with a cheap 8-Bit SCSI port. Some other may not need SCSI at all, but want to pay the lowest possible price for the step into the G4 generation. Consequently, we have decided to offer base boar
ds without specialized I/O functionality, but with the option for customized configurations.<BR>
								<BR>
								The good news is, that the <B>CYBERSTORM G4</B> as well as the <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> will both have PCI slots already on board, which will allow to connect PCI add-ons directly. In order to make the boards fit into the same Amiga systems as the earlier <B>CYBERSTORM PPC</B> and <B>BLIZZARD 603 </B>boards, we will be using Mini-PCI connectors, on which PCI modules in the new Mini-PCI standard can be installed. This design allows the users to connect Mini-PCI add-on cards directly to the <B>CYBERSTORM G4</B> as well as the <B>BLIZZARD G4</B>, without the need to spend money for a PCI bus expansion or to worry about mechanical integration of such a board. Developers, as well, can easily use either common Mini-PCI cards and write drivers for those, or quickly design new Mini-PCI cards with standard PCI chips.<BR>
								<BR>
								Another change is the usage of standard SO-DIMMs (SDRAM) as they can be found on modern notebooks, which also allow to design the boards in very compact form factors, thus making the <B>CYBERSTORM G4</B> fit into all A3000 and A4000 desktop and tower models (with fully installed memory and Mini-PCI cards), and make the <B>BLIZZARD G4</B> fit into most A1200 tower cases on the market and in use. </FONT><FONT face="Arial" color="#aa0000"><B>IMPORTANT NOTE: </B></FONT><FONT face="Arial">These modules are available at similar prices compared to the standard SDRAM DIMMs, as theya are used in many computers such as notebooks or Apple's iMac.<BR>
								<BR>
								As an integrated standard I/O port, the <B>CYBERSTORM G4</B> as well as the<B> BLIZZARD G4</B> will also have two USB ports to connect to a rapidly growing number of inexpensive expansion devices. </FONT></P>
								<P><FONT face="Arial" color="#aa0000"><B>EXPANSION OPTIONS - August 04, 99:</B></FONT><FONT face="Arial"><BR>
								<BR>
								phase 5 digital products will also be offering some cost-effective MiniPCI add-on modules. We have a number of options which add-on boards for I/O purposes may be developed by us, and which will be quickly realized depending on the actual demand. It may be noted that these options include those functions which were originally considered to be on-board, and are now simply moved to an optional MiniPCI card. The currently planned, optionally available modules include:</FONT></P>

								<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2">For any of these modules, a minimum order quantity of 250 units must be reached, in order to justify the software and hardware realization.
