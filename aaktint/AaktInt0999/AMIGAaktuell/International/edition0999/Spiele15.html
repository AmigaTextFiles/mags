<H2>15. Interview with Jens Neubauer (Programmer of SeaSide)</H2>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">AMIGA&nbsp;aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">The features of SeaSide are read nicely (more than 100 areals, beaches, lakes and rivers, more than 1000 setup combinations etc.). How long
have been working at Seaside?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">I got the idea of SeaSide on a vacation in Denmark in 1994. Then I began to create the game. After approx. 2 years - in 1996-
a first executable version was ready. This one originally was supposed to be sold as shareware. Andreas (Rem.: This is
Andreas Magerl from APC&amp;TCP) offered to publish the game after some improvements were beeing made (especially with
the graphics) as a commercial one. This was an interesting offer for me, so I have been programming since early 1997
for a commercial version of SeaSide. To get the graphics as nice as possible I hired another graphical designer - Michael
Zimmer - in addition to Felix Weissig. The sound is made by Christian Wirsig. Code and idea is my responsibility - so
it's Jens Neubauer.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

It is a well-known fact, that Amiga games even sell worse. Why decided you to make you all the work to develop a game, which
might sell (very) badly?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">
As I already mentioned before, first it was a 'Just4fun' shareware project and then, when I got the offer of APC&amp;TCP,
well I have liked the idea to make something &quot;professional&quot;. And if I began something, I have the ambitions
to complete it (that's what I tell myself ;)&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">AMIGA&nbsp;aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Is SeaSide going to support graphics boards
and PowerPC® processors?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">Because the beta test are currently running I don't want to clearly answer these questions. Currently there have been problems
when operating graphics boards. A direct support is not planned either for graphics boards nor for PowerPC processors.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">AMIGA&nbsp;aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">How do you evaluate the future of the games market with the (Classic-) Amiga?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">That is difficult to say and I think, reality will differ to wishes. I like to remember the days, when a Turrican2 game
kept you for several weeks in front of the screen. But unfortunately I think, that these moments are history. The lost
terrain due to the PSX and the N64 cannot gotten back in my opinion. To reach this goal lots of money for marketing and changing of
the image had to be spent. The games market will shrink as time goes by and just some manufacturers will produce for the Amiga.
And so there will be just the choice for an additional PC, PSX or N64 for the &quot;real player&quot;.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

How long do you have your Amigas and what do you usually do with it?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">
I got my first Amiga from my first &quot;Western money&quot; early in 1990. <KBD>(Remark of the translator: This means, that Jens Neubauer formerly
lived in the German Democratic Republic. The Deutsche Mark was often referred to as &quot;Western money&quot; as the GDR had,
of course, its own currency, the Mark der DDR (Mark of the GDR).)</KBD> I do not know my original motive any more,
but it was no fault at all ;). It is usually used for programming and for the daily work - and for playing classics ;)&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">AMIGA&nbsp;aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">
Has the graphics of SeaSide completely developped on the Amiga or has there been the use of PCs? If so, what programs have you been
using?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Jens&nbsp;Neubauer:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">I created SeaSide completely on my Amiga. The graphical designers use in addition to the Amiga Mac and PC. I do not know,
what the sounder uses ;( For the development has been used CanDo 2.5 of Inovatronics, for the graphics PPaint 4.0 and
DPaintIV. I cannot give informations for the graphics - but I assume, it's Real3D on Mac and Truespace on PC - but these are just
presumptions ;)&nbsp;</TD></TR>
