<P>The objective of the AAC is to help us better plan the future of <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga</a>
through close communications with people who are viewed as leaders in the
Amiga community.  The members of the AAC have all executed non-disclosure
agreements (NDAs), with Amiga and will have access to confidential
information regarding future products and plans.  This allows Amiga to
share sensitive information with respected members of the Amiga community
without having to disclose our plans publicly.

<P>The members of the AAC were selected to represent their different areas of
affiliation within the Amiga community - the Press, Developers,
Dealers/Distributors, and the User Group organizations.   The AAC is
designed to provide a flow of information from the Community to the Amiga
management team and from Amiga back to the community.  Each of the members
of the AAC will act as a conduit to the community and the areas that they
represent.

<P>We held our first official meetings with the AAC in London and in
Sacramento with over 20 AAC members participate in these first official
meetings. The AAC was able to share with Amiga many of the desires, and
needs of the community.  As we work towards the launch of the Next
Generation Amiga the input received by the AAC will help guide those
decisions.

<P>"We are excited to welcome the members of the AAC as active
representatives of the Amiga community and look forward to implementing
many of the programs suggested in the near future,  stated Jim Collas,
"together we will make a difference in computing forever."
