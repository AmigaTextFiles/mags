1. Reaction upon the Letter of Harald Knoop (by Steffen Häuser)<BR>
</P><P>
»>I believe it as wrong to make Linux the kernel of the Amiga operating<BR>
>system. Why does Amiga Inc. abandon QNX, which is nearly finished?<BR>
>Additionally with a sudden change of mind the ...<BR>
</P><P>
In the contrary I take it to be the right decision. QNX had one year to<BR>
"amigize" their OS but NOTHING happend on that way. This shows, that QNX<BR>
never was engaged in "AMIGA" but tended only to find a market for their own<BR>
OS. Formerly the Be corporation was as little interested in it. I was not<BR>
in favour for BeOS and actually I was against QNX from the very beginning<BR>
even if I did not oppose it, as long AMIGA supported it.<BR>
</P><P>
With Linux the source code is publicly available. AMIGA has the possibility<BR>
to change the OS to their liking. As mentioned, the purpose is *not* to<BR>
supply a computer in a standard Linux distribution but to develop a new<BR>
AmigaOS around an up-to-date OS-kernel. A similar way (of course not with<BR>
Linux, but with another Unix-near operating system) is presently followed<BR>
by Apple corporation with Mac OS X. If you have a look at Mac OS X you<BR>
cannot recognize, that actually it is Unix. It looks and feels like Mac OS.<BR>
This is what Amiga plans.<BR>
</P><P>
With QNX this could never become possible, because they seem to have<BR>
refused to change the Look&Feel of their OS (or why else does Neutrino<BR>
still not appear like AmigaOS?).<BR>
</P><P>
>As an ALTERNATIVE Linux might be good in any case. But in reality ...<BR>
</P><P>
Once again! It does not concern the operating System Linux, as it is in <BR>
use on PC's.<BR>
</P><P>
What ought to be mentioned as well: QNX may have a powerful kernel at its<BR>
disposal (as well as Linux), but according to what I have read about it the<BR>
OS around it is quite POOR. There is not even a draft of the datatypes ...<BR>
</P><P>
But like usual several people in the News Groups must have their say, even<BR>
if they haven't informed themselves in any way to be competent about it.<BR>
</P><P>
A further aspect is, if rumors come true, that the CPU will be the Transmeta<BR>
processor of the Linux inventor. Thanks to special capabilities of this<BR>
CPU (following the rumors) it should be possible to install an Amiga Classic<BR>
Emulation which outruns the abilities of a PowerPC board.<BR>
