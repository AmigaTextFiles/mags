<H2>26. Emulator news</H2>
<P>
Do you remember November/December of last year? Fine, because this news is linked to that. It's about the emulators Genecide
and Nesticide by Jesse Livengood, that were to run with extremely high speed. Jesse wanted to release these emulators in
December '98. But when nobody heard about these two emulators, anybody thought, it was a joke. Now, Richard Sandgren found
out the eMail address of Jesse and asked him in this matter. He replied, that he does not program for the Amiga anymore,
but he wanted to release Nesticide this week. From Genecide he 'only' offers the sources. So, who wants to continue programming
the emulator should report to him. But Genecide seems to be nearly complete.
