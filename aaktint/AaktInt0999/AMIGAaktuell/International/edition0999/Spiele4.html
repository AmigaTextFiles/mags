<LI> Hyperion Software brings Worms: Armageddon
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It is nearly a standard of the games section: Each month the first headline is an announcement of Hyperion Software!
This month the Germany company, consisting of well-knon persons like e.g. Thomas and Hans-Joerg Frieden, licenced the
game Worms: Armageddon from Team 17. The release will not be limited to the Classic Amigas, but also for the AmigaNG.
So this is the first Hyperion game, which will be released for the AmigaNG. The Classic Amiga version will run on
graphics boards first, but maybe also support AGA.

<LI> Heretic II also for 68k Amigas?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Maybe there will be a 68k version of Heretic II. But this would require a Warp3D compatible graphics board, anyway. Currently
Hyperion doubts, if the software renderer would be fast enough on a 68k. So wait and be excited. There are first predictions
regarding the speed of Heretic II on PPC Amigas: Stenn Haeuser assumes, that due to the high speed of Quake II, which is based
on the Heretic II engine, on his PowerMAC, that the Amiga PPC version will run very fast, too.

<UL>
<LI> Titan Software publishes future Hyperion Software titles
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Titan Software announced the cooperation with Hyperion Software. The first two tiles published are Shogo and Heretic II.
They are as well as for Classic as for NG Amigas. At the same time Titan Software asked the Amiga Community not to pirate
copy these products.

<UL>
<LI> Operation Counterstrike cancelled
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The retreat of the publisher Sadeness Software brought BlueBlack Solution to cancel their game Operation Counterstrike, now.
Operation Counterstrike was one of the mostly awaited Amiga games. According to rumours it was supposed to be nearly ready,
because a demo was to be released this month. At the same time BlueBlack Solution announced a new game named Siberian&nbsp;Sun,
which would become the best Amiga real time strategy game. Siberian&nbsp;Sun would lean heavily on Operation Counterstrike.
A preview of the game would be published on one of the next Amiga Format CD's.

<LI> Future foundation versions will be published by Epic Marketing
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Paul Burkey and Epic Marketing announced their cooperation. After Paul Burkey surprisingly announced not to further develop
Foundation, because the distributer Sadeness has not been existing, last month, Epic Marketing decided to convince him,
to release the long awaited PPC version and the new levels, anyway. This mission has been successful and the next Foundation
version, a complete remake, will be release about late this year.

<LI> Land of Genesis
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Jump 'n' run fans can take a deep breath-in: After there was a mangle of fine jump 'n' runs, Maurizio Demelli announced
Land of Genesis, a jump 'n' run with Shoot 'em up extras. He worked more than 3 years at this game, what was also shown
by the enthusiasm of the Amiga users on the World of Amiga. Land of Genesis is nearly complete and offers great things:
More than 120 opponents with more than 2000 animation frames and a revolutionary sound system with digital voice output,
CD music and changing music with the levels. It is to be released in October, so that's soon.

<LI> Sabrina Offline by Digital Images
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
On the World of Amiga Digital Images described their game as &quot;the best game of all times&quot;. Well, what should
someone say in reply? Sabrina Offline will become a 3D platform game with characters of Eric W. Schwartz. It is based
on his comic strip series Sabrina Online. It will become a completely new game, that beats everything. In addition you
meet all the well-known characters by Eric Schwartz, like e.g. Sabrina, Amy, Thomas etc. It will be released for the
AmigaNG, only.

<LI> Edict 2999 by Amiga Farm
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A new space battle game named Edict 2999 was announced by the developers, who strangely call themselves Amiga Farm. There
has not been announced much, but two interesting features are known already:
There will be a two screen mode, which might be interesting for graphics board users. The action screen will be displayed
by the graphics board and the screen with the statistics by the AGA chipset. In addition there will be a kind of 'really
intelligent opponents'. So we can get excited.
