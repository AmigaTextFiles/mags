<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the September edition of your AMIGA aktuell games section. Unfortunately this is a quite short preface (I will
exlain later, why). Of course, top news of this month are  from Hyperion, again. They announced a port of Worms:&nbsp;Armageddon
for Classic &amp; NG Amigas. Let's see, which game will be ported next...
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately there are no reviews on the Amiga side <KBD>(Remark of the translator: The ones you find here are from the last edition.)</KBD>,
because I currently have big trouble with my Amiga. On one hand my CD-ROM doesn't read any files ~700 KB, and on the other
hand I have problems with my keyboard (continues signalling of a key). E.g. I had to restart three times, until I was able
to type this text error free. If someone has an idea, which could be the problem with the CD-ROM or the keyboard, he can
get in contact with me. I think, that the CD-ROM is defect, so you can contact me, if you have a CD-ROM (better than 4x, not
better than 12x) for little money. Then there will be reviews :-) Okay, in the next edition, there will be reviews, of course,
so I have to get a new CD-ROM. If it will not run again, I will really have a problem... I have got T-Zer0 for 4 weeks, but
I have been unable to play it! So, if it works fine, you can read e.g. these reviews in the next edition: T-Zer0, Wet,
The Prophet and Speccy Emulators.
</P>

Andreas Koch from the Mac corner was quite busy, again and wrote some tests/introductions. Within the last second a test
report regarding Sim City 2000 was added by Ingo Schmitz. Thank you very much for that! By the way, anbody can add reviews
for the games section, as Ingo did. No matter, if it is for the Amiga or for the Mac. Just send your reviews to me or to
Andreas Koch!
</P>
<P>
The charts have not been updated, but this is not my fault, but the one of GTI. There have not been any other than the ones
from June 8, 1999. Maybe this works with the next edition.
</P>
<P>
Well, then have fun with this edition,
</P>
