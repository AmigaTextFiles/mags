<H1>News from AMIGA</H1>
<H2>1. JIM COLLAS RESIGNED AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMIGA</H2>
<P>
ZDNet spreaded this unbelievible news in the evening of September 1 as first one: Jim Collas unexpectedly resigned as
president and Chief Executing Officer (CEO) of AMIGA. An AMIGA speaker said, that Collas left the company to persue personal
interests. At the same time ZDNet informed about the news, that Jim Collas wanted to sell 118,000 Gateway shares, which may
indicate, that Jim Collas considers the 'File Gateway', he once belonged to as Senior Vice President, as closed.
</P>
<P>
The previous AMIGA Vice president and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Tom Schmidt had taken over directing the company.
</P>
<P>
According to CNET News Gateway speaker Brad Shaw confirmed the resignation. The basic plans will be executed with Tom
Schmidt at the top and the existing developer team. &quot;Tom Schmidt is well suited to take Amiga to the next level, and the technology will move ahead unabated.&quot;,
Brad Shaw is cited.
</P>
<P>
These are the informations about the new AMIGA president Tom Schmidt, taken from the AMIGA Homepage:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Prior to joining Amiga, Mr. Schmidt served as Vice President and General Manager of a strategic business enterprise within AlliedSignal, an advanced technology and
manufacturing company based in Morristown, NJ. Previous to AlliedSignal, Mr. Schmidt worked at Baxter Healthcare Corporation in
several key operating and sales and marketing roles. He also served as a Senior Project Manager and Strategic Management Consultant at
Arthur Andersen.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Also no longer with AMIGA2is Bill McEwen, who was in theory in duties of marketing, but practically was responsable for
the affairs of the community. According to own statements McEwen learned on August 30, that August 31 was his last working
day with AMIGA.
</P>
<P>
Maybe that user group coordinator Derreck Lisle is no longer under contract of AMIGA. This shows, that the moderating of
the AMIGA bulletin boards, has been given completely to the AMIGA webmaster Matthias Grohmann.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile AMIGA Vice President Petro Tyschtschenko cancelled his participation of the Finnish Amiga show Saku 99, which
is on September 4. Due to the change on the top of AMIGA his presence at an important meeting in the USA was necessary
at this weekend.
</P>
<P>
More to the dramatic events of these days with an evaluation you will find at the end of this edition.
