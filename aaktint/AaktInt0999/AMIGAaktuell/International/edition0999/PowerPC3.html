Statement about the current situation of the warpTrans project of WARP9
</P>
<P>
Hello, Amigans!
</P>
<P>
Maybe you noticed our warpTrans project through the media. If not, this is another short description:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Full text translator for English-German, German-English
</LI>
<BR><LI> High recognition ratio of dictates (sound card expected)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Dictates can be saved as text and HTML
</LI>
<BR><LI> Includes expandable Easy-Click-Dictionary for 400,000 words
</LI>

</LI>
<BR><LI> newly developped voice output system (English or German)
</LI>
<BR><LI> OCR support
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Sounds good, doesn't it?
Since January 1999 a Dutch Team has been programming. Based on an already existend database of words a porting has been
made possible. The voice recognition is nearly complete and is with this high quality unique on the AMIGA. An integration
of this system into other applications is possible. To complete the warpTrans project to a final version, the time until
November should be enough.
</P>
<P>
Even due to the announcements the response of interested users was quite low, but all of them call for new, innovative
software. So someone should expect, that such a program should get some attention. But it seems, that this is not true.
Does already everything exist and no one needs anything new?
With this situation an important programmer left the team, because he did not see any future with this project.
</P>
<P>
One one hand, this makes it much more difficult to keep our schedule and in addition we of WARP9 are not very happy with
the interest of the Amigans, which brings us into the situation to find out, in how far it is useful to take this financial
risk to release this program. The guessed sale numbers confirm my doubts. Taks with other software companies in the AMIGA
sector showed, that they sell quite often a little number of copies of their, sometimes high-quality, software, which might
be much more interesting in use and more interesting to the users. But there is also a number of &quot;neat&quot; productions,
which cannot expected to be bought by a user. - Just look skeptical to the games market. We can understand, why no one buys
them. Of course, we will have a close look on the market and then make our next step. We also will put our attention to
the Next Generation Amiga. Until that we will definitely work at our project!
We also inform you, that pirate copies have a big part in the horrible low sale numbers and reference to the Anti-Piracy
campaing of <A HREF="http://www.haaga-partner.com">Haage&amp;Partner</A>.
</P>
<P>
There has not made a final decision, yet. The result is:
</P>
<P>
The completion of warpTrans is up to you.
</P>
<P>
If we had to go the sad way, we would be willing to give the rights of the program to someone else. We wish any software
companies the success they deserve.
