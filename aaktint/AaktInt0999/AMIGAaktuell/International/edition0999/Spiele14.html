<H1>14. Mac corner review: Pirates GOLD!</H1>
<P>
There is also not much to tell about this game, because it has been available for the Amiga as a CD32 version. But I have not
been able, to play it on the Amiga side. This is why I cannot compare it to the Mac version :-(
</P>
<P>
This game, which you might name a &quot;Pirate sim&quot;, is about making his luck as ship owner in the Carribean Sea of the 17th century.
In theory, this can be made by dealing with cities of the four different nations, but being a pirate might be the quicker and
more interesting way. If you made your decision you should find some crew to get a basis for capturing and conquering of
enemy ships. It will not take long for the first ships to show up on the horizon with a loud &quot;Sail Ho!&quot;. If you
want to capture such a vessel a sea battle occurs, in which you can get a good advantage for the following capatins duel by intelligent
maneuvering and use of your cannons. This duel is fought with one of three blades. Now you can choose between quick and hard
hits and to parry the opponents hits. The same duel is, if you conquer cities, after you reached the enemy fort by ship or
on foot. But the conquering of a fort is a special ability. In addition to the gold, which you plunder from ships or cities,
you rob goods, which can be sold in the next friendly harbour.
</P>
<P>
Another game, you do not find out, that it runs on an emulation, if you have an 040/40. There is no difference to an original
Mac with the speed.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Even, if the graphics of the Mac version is quite nice, the controls are not, because you have to get use to it,
especially in duels. The mixture of mouse and keyboard control could have been solved more elegently. However, Pirates Gold
is a &quot;valuable game&quot; and can get players enthusiastic (at least me) :-)
