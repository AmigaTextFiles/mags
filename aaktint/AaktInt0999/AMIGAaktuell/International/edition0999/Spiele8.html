<H1>8. Review: Doktor Version 1.1 (by Dirk Wenk)</H1>
<P>
Another tetris clone?
</P>
<P>
No, not at all! Because Doktor is a really great, new game for the Amiga, that not just has the goal to place your pieces,
but also to dissolve them! This is done, if 4 pieces are created horizontally or vertically with these pieces. If no preset
pieces remain, you win the level!
</P>
<P>
There are 24 levels alltogether, which have a great background picture. If you did all of the 24 levels, you will watch a
tiny &quot;You won&quot; extro with some more greetings (partially Italian)  :)
</P>
<P>
It is most fun, if you play it with another player! Because then the player gets into the next level and wins the level, who
got away his pieces, first. Unfortunately the background pictures are the same with these 5 levels and there is a bug in the
game! But I will tell you more about that, later....
</P>
<P>
It is really unfair, if the opponent dissolves more than 4 pieces in one move, because then panelty pieces fall down: That'
really nasty!
</P>
<P>
Right at this place there is the bug (unfortunately!). Because, if you set a piece right in the moment the opponent dissolves
more than 4 pieces, the program hangs and you cannot continue the game. Unfortunately this bug is still present with revision
1.1. But maybe, no more in revision 1.2, so let's wait for a surprise!  ;)
</P>
<P>
It is controlled by joystick or joypad. The music can be switched off, if you want and with revision 1.1 it is possible to
save the highscore!
</P>
<BR>
Conclusion: A game, which gets two people busy for hours! (Recommended especially for long night shifts ;)
