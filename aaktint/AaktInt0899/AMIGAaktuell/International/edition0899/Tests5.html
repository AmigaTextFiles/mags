<H2>5. Report: Glass screen filter for 14/15 inch monitors (by Dirk Wenk)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Who doesn't know this situation: You work for hours with your computer and then you get those headaches from the
back of the head and find their way to the brain...
</P>
<P>
This is not necesssary, because with a TFT screen working is much nicer! But unfortunately these monitors are much too
expensive, for most of us...
</P>
<P>
Well, what do you do with your old monitor, if you want to get the picture more pleasant to the eyes? You turn down the
brightness, mostly the contrast and what do you have then? A still bright, but bad in contrast gray picture, which isn't
good at all... And right on this place the screen filter joins the scenery. I previously thought, &quot;Well, you don't
need that.&quot; and something like that, but now I'm happy, that I got this glass screenfilter for 34.95 DEM (approx. 17.83 Euros)
from Knopex.  The first opinion of it is, that is is plain - simple cardboard box. Opened youg get a glass filter, a monitor
holder and a duster (size A7 or smaller). The manual is written quite bad, because there are either velcro fastenings (TM)
included in the package nor are they shown on the picture, that should have shown them! They just mixed up the words
adhesive tape and velcro fastenings (TM)!
First to get the holder of the glass screen on the monitor. I recommend to hold it first and mark it with a pencil. Then
stick the double sided adhesive tape on the holder and to the monitor. Now 'lock' the glass filter and then adjust the
distance to the monitor, that's easy! After that just look for an earthing to connect the earthing cable to. I used the
earthing of the 3&#189;&quot; floppy, because it was next to my monitor. Now, that nothing can go wrong, switch on!
</P>
<P>
WOW! The first impression is not bad! Higher contrast with less brightness! So no brighten the monitor and forget the
contrast. Yes, now you get a wonderful contrasty, not dazzling, bright picture! Even after hours, there was no headache
or rubbing my eyes!
Even if the glass screen is multiple-AR-coated to avoid reflectins, there are more than with the anti-reflection-coating
of the monitor, but they nearly aren't visible. Just if the room is bright and the picture is dark you see yourself mirrored
in violet. It seems, that the violet is from the UV-coating, but it doesn't result in false colours, there's just a little
greening with grey pictures.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Fuer 34.95 DEM (approx. 17.83 Euros) you get a fine product, which is good for the eyes! Absolutely recommendable!
