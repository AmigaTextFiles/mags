To quote the README file:

Welcome to the 3rd Generation of Voyager.<BR>
NOTA BENE:  This is a snapshot of a work in progress, not a finished product.  It may crash, burn and nuke, cause loss of data, and
hair.  It's incomplete.  Handle with care.<BR>
You have been warned.<BR><BR>
NOTA BENE²:  There is a considerable lack of any documentation at the moment.  Dealing with it requires a good knowledge of AmigaOS and
program installation (although you can normally just copy the distribution drawer to your harddisk and run it from there)<BR><BR>
NOTA BENE&sup3;:  This version will only run with a keyfile.  It does accept V 2.95 keyfiles and NC2, but will timeout at 31-8-99 then.  It
will only run on 68020 CPUs und up.<BR><BR>

So enough ranting, now to the bright side. What's new?<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Javascript.  Javascript 1.3, implemented as a nifty just-in-time
bytecode compiler for maximum efficiency on our dusty 680x0 class
machines.</LI>
<LI> Heavily improved GUI, allowing custom placement of control
panels using Szymon Ulatowski's excellent Tearoff classes
(http://amiga.com.pl/~szulat/). Create fastlinks by simply
dropping an URL in the fast link panel area. Reworked
MENU structure to be overally more sensible. Added support
for wheel mice using the NewMouse standard.</LI>
<LI> Heavily improved plugin API now allowing for embedded
objects which can handle any MIME type.</LI>
<LI> As a first application of aforementioned plugin API:
A shockwave flash player. Unlike the freeware player which
was circulating recently, it supports embedded movies and
URL handling.</LI>
<LI> SSLv3/TLSv1 security support utilizing OpenSSL
(http://www.openssl.org). Also deals with the recent
catchword "SGC" by offering 128 bit encryption all the
time, not only when US crypto laws permit.</LI>
<LI> Modularized image decoders, offered in a wide
variety, for all kinds of Amiga hardware. Voyager
automagically selects the one best suited for your machine 
during start. Also updated are libjpeg and libpng to recent
versions. Now also supports "smart" incremental JPEG decoding.</LI>
<LI> New Bookmark system using CManager.mcc, sharing
URLs and everything with other Vapor applications.</LI>
<LI> Improved Cache system which now honours HTTP/1.1 Expires:
header - much faster loading with properly configured web
servers, as cache freshness doesn't need to be verified.</LI>
<LI> Numerous other changes. Please refer to the detailed version
history at the end of this document.</LI>
</UL>
<U>ToDo</U>
</PRE>
Well, what's still to do?<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Full optmization build. This one has been build
without any code optimization, and thus is considerably
slower than any possible release (esspecially for
compute-intensive tasks, like layouting or
image decoding)</LI>
<LI> JS: Some properties and methods are known to not be fully
implemented yet. The worse part is that, as with HTML,
there is a huge descrepancy with Javascript as it is in the
books, and Javascript as it's used by Web"masters" around
the world. Silly, ineffecient constructs and abuse of
implementation side-effects seem to be a must, and it needs
lots of work to properly mimick the behavior. Most
notably lacking are currently &lt;SCRIPT SRC=url&gt; , handling of
JS entities &lt;IMG SRC=&amp;{js-code};&gt;</LI>
<LI> GUI: Fully configurable toolbar with standard and custom
ARexx/JS commands.</LI>
<LI> ARexx: The ARexx-Port needs as much as work as
it needed in previous versions. On top of the list
is the exposure of the JS interpreter via ARexx, allowing
you to do nifty things (tm) with the DOM of loaded
documents.</LI>
<LI> HTML: Still lots of stuff to improve. Could do with
some more speed when dealing with heavily nested tables,
although there's a heavy trade-off between Doing It Right and
Doing It Fast (you probably figured this out by comparing
the previous V with current releases of other Amiga browsers :)</LI>
<LI> Flash: Speed. Sound. A PPC version.</LI>
<LI> Image decoders: A PPC version (now not too far away
due to the modularized concept)</LI>
<LI> Printing still sucks.</LI>
<LI> Debugging. Debugging. More Debugging.</LI>
</UL>
Updates to V&sup3; will be released frequently. If you install
vapor_update.library, you will be automatically informed.<BR><BR>
<U>Support & Bug reporting</U>
Please join the Voyager mailing list to discuss this beta
release. Please do not contact any of the authors directly -
their time is severly limited, and chances are good that
you want them to do some work on the code instead of
answering mail all day long :)
To subscribe, mail to
 &lt;<A HREF="mailto:voager-request@vapor.com">voyager-request@vapor.com</A>&gt;
and put "SUBSCRIBE" in the subject or body of the mail.
The mailing list is archived at
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/voager@vapor.com/"> http://www.mail-archive.com/voyager@vapor.com/</A><BR>
Bug reports are appreciated, just stuff as much information
as possible into them. A quick glance at the V
mailing list will reveal whether 50000 people have already
reported before. The JSERROR.LOG functionality will
come in handy for dealing with JS quirks.<BR><BR>

<U>Version History</U><BR>
[NOTE: Changes prior to version 2.95 have been removed]
<UL>
<LI>2.96.1<UL>
<LI> net: fixed a lame bug: when successfully verifying an
  existant cache object, it was never actually updated
  on disk as a read lock was kept on the file.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.3<UL>
<LI> layouter: fixed problem with tables embedded in lists</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.4<UL>
<LI> net: added new option "Ignore server sent MIME types?".
  Disables matching filetypes by HTTP Content-Type:
  header and instead uses file extension matching.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.5<UL>
<LI>(intermediate WOA show version)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.6<UL>
<LI> prefs: added support for Contact Manager
<LI> prefs: now saves a .BAK file of the bookmarks</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.7
<UL>
[NC2 compile]
<LI>2.96.8
<UL>
<LI> net: fixed handling of %hh URL escape codes in FTP
  pathes<</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.9
<UL>
<LI> general: timeout fix (ahem)</LI>
<LI> general: added support for &quot;vapor_update.library&quot;</LI></UL><LI>
<LI>2.96.10
<UL>
<LI> net: fixed handling of stoneage HTTP/0.9 server replies.
  This showed up with the xxx.to redirect services.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.11
<UL>
<LI> general: will now check whether files passed via WBArgs
  are actually config files; if not, it will open them
  with file:///</LI>
<LI> net: SSL cert info requester referenced uninitialized
  memory and thus trashed up big time</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.12
<UL>
<LI> net: fixed SSL over proxy. V was actually sending full
  encoded URLs to the CONNECTed server, handling SSL PROXY
  like plain HTTP proxies. Ahem.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.13
<UL>
<LI> layouter: added support for &lt;TABLE/TR/TD BACKGROUND&gt;  images</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.14
<UL>
<LI> net: bah. Prefs flag screwup caused "Ignore server MIME types"
  to be set all the time. Prefs also weren't saved. Bah.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.15
<UL>
<LI> prefs: env:VAPOR/VOYAGER_LASTUSEDDIR wasn't saved</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.16
<UL>
<LI> layouter: fixed handling of small &lt;SELECT&gt; s in popup mode</LI>
<LI> net: Cookie path comparision was screwed.</LI>
<LI> net: Cookies which had no path= were saved with the current
  path, instead of &quot;/&quot;</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.17
<UL>
<LI> JS: added JS support, actually in form of a just-in-time
  bytecode-interpreting compiler. Parser, compiler,
  interpreter, stack is working. Completely missing DOM
  at this stage.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.18
<UL>
<LI> Prefs: added Javascript page, with global JS enabling
  and JS debugging enabling. Disabling debuging will cause
  the compiler to not place line number information in
  the resulting bytecode. This is faster and uses less
  memory, but run time errors will not show any line numbers.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.19
<UL>
<LI> GUI: fixed a few problems with bogus help bubbles</LI>
<LI> Net: fixed a bug in nethandler to avoid causing
  broken http URLs (e.g. http:path) to access
  NULL pointers and eventually crash</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.20
<UL>
<LI> General: Now utilizes vapor_toolkit.library</LI>
<LI> JS: added function call handling</LI>
<LI> JS: added variable handling</LI>
<LI> JS: added void(expr) and typeof(expr)</LI>
<LI> JS: totally removed internal int type to simplify
  expression handler</LI>
<LI> JS: fixed short circuit evaluation for ?: conditional
  operators and || and && logical operators</LI>
<LI> JS: added "," operator</LI>
<LI> JS: added "delete" to grammar</LI>
<LI> JS: added multi-dimensional array references to grammar</LI>
<LI> JS: added "new objectname" syntax to grammar</LI>
<LI> HTML: added &lt;NOSCRIPT&gt; &lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;  handling</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.21
<UL>
<LI> General: again using AmigaOS math libraries and IEEE
  math format</LI>
<LI> Cache: Cleanup is now no longer done on every start.
  V keeps an estimated cache size based on cache flush
  and input, and only starts a cleanup operation when
  the estimated size exceeds the limit, or 30 days
  after the last cleanup</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.22
<UL>
<LI> GUI: Main window now uses Tearoff.mcc to allow vanilla
  gui customization. The tearoff settings are saved
  to ENV/ENVARC when snapshotting the window.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.23
<UL>
<LI> JS: fixed (lvalue) syntax in grammar</LI>
<LI> JS: fixed lexer not dealing with \r as the only
  line termination character</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.24
<UL>
<LI> Net: Cookies with subpathes still weren't sent
  properly. Grrr.</LI>
<LI> Layouter: restructured font handling. No longer
  calls upon AmigaOS font handling for every
  html class layout. Also reduced memory usage by
  about 7k per class instance, and reduced
  time consuming side effects caused when nonexistant
  fonts are specified and diskfont tries to reload
  them all the time (notably with Frames)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.25
<UL>
<LI> Gfx: low chip mem situation handling
  wasn't foolproof. Failure of being
  able to obtain a buffer bitmap was detected,
  but the original fastmem image was still
  copied into the (nonexistant) chip planes.
  Blam.</LI>
<LI> Gfx: image decoder is now external.
  V loads the proper image decoder based
  on the system configuration (CPU/FPU)
  from Plugins/imgdecode_[arch].vlib.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.26
<UL>
<LI> Net: net handler now tries to recv()
  as much data as is available, and not
  wait for the next select. This should
  considerably improve behavior with
  masive amounts of connections (i.e.
  porn thumbnail sites)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.27
<UL>
<LI> General: about: now shows the
  vimgdecode_vlib and voyager_ssleay.vlib
  version & dates</LI>
<LI> Parser: the meaning of NOSCRIPT was
  reversed; NOSCRIPT stuff was processed when
  JS was enabled and vice-versa. Note that
  you have to disable JS now to view sites
  which build content dynamically (i.e.
  www.thehun.net)</LI>
<LI> GUI: fixed horizontal layouting of fastlinks</LI>
<LI> GUI: rewrote saving of tearoff settings.
  Now uses a clean approach with a special
  dataspace which is saved on quit.
  Note that the settings are currently only
  saved to ENV:MUI/Voyager.tearoff, I haven't
  decided when to save to ENVARC: as well 
  yet</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.28
<UL>
<LI> Imagedecoder: fixed low chip mem handler
  return code (would always return MEM_DID_NOTHING;
  now returns MEM_TRY_AGAIN when memory was freed</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: low chip mem handler would
  access a unsemaphored main thread pool and
  thus could Nuke Heavily® under certain cirumstances
  when triggered</LI>
<LI> General: Shell arguments are now tested if they
  point to actual files; if so, they are opened
  with file:///</LI>
<LI> GUI: removed now obsolete "Show Fastlinks"
  menu item</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.29
<UL>
<LI> GUI: fixed horizontal fastlink layout weighting</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.30
<UL>
<LI> Parser: V will now send &lt;INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN&gt;  elements
  in sequence with other form elements. This should fix several
  broken cgi scripts which relied upon the NS/MSIE sequence
  of argument passing (for example http://clickboom.com/portal)</LI>
<LI> GUI: source view is now editable, and has a "OK" button
  to submit changes to all browser windows (I seriously hope
  this helps getting more detailed bug reports :^)</LI>
<LI> GUI: added CManager.mcc support (to replace Bookmarks.mcc).
  Note: SaveAs and Goto isn't working yet</LI>
<LI> Net: modified network handler to no longer do a gethostbyname()
  for IP addresses. This should fix problems when trying to access
  hosts by IP which don't have working reverse lookup.</LI>
<LI> JS: implemented local var handling</LI>
<LI> JS: implemented &quot;var x;&quot; and &quot;var x=y;&quot;</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.31
<UL>
<LI> GUI: fixed CM interfacing</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.32
<UL>
<LI> Net: added "about:cachestats" to get a short cache status
  overview</LI>
<LI> Net: now uses inet_addr() to resolve "host names"; should fix
  problems when a IP address URL points to a host which has
  no working reverse DN</LI>
<LI> GUI: now uses new CManager.mcc AddEntry method to insert
  new entries at the currently selected leaf node</LI>
<LI> Net: fixed a lame bug introduced with the polling
  read improvement from 2.96.26. Would lose bytes during
  transfer and cause general network suckness. This is
  the reason for all the trashed imagery et.all. reported
  recently.</LI>
<LI> JS: began adding DOM handling</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.33
<UL>
<LI> Net: fixed the lame bug mentioned above, really this time</LI>
<LI> Layouter: longstanding issue: changed the additional space
  calculated for italic text to 1 pixel</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: fixed another possible trashing in finding
  space for chipmem bitmap clones</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.34
<UL>
<LI> GUI: began menu redesign</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.35
<UL>
<LI> Imagedecoder: changed low memory handler to actually
  flush in place instead of relying on the image decoder
  process to do the job. Also returns more sensible
  error codes.</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: updated to libjpeg 6b</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: updated to libpng 1.0.3. Should fix all
  of the PNG related griefs reported so far</LI>
<LI> Prefs: now properly passes down image related
  preferences to the decoder lib. Yes, you get
  dithering again :)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.36
<UL>
<LI> General: will now detect running Executive and
  tell it to keep V's subprocess relative priorities
  in order. Thanks to David Gerber for the code.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.37
<UL>
<LI> Imagedecoder: upgraded to use zlib 1.1.3 with
  faster decrypting</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: rewrote low mem handler again
  to not attempt to ReleasePen() or nets_close()
  from within the handler</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: ultra lame bug: The low mem handler
  for the chip mem buffered bitmap clones was
  always returning MEM_TRY_AGAIN no matter what,
  and exec obeyed, causing a total deadlock
  on a memory flush.</LI>
<LI> GUI: upgraded WebTV to WebVision interface</LI>
<LI> HTML: added &copy; and &reg; entities</LI>
<LI> Layouter: handling of &nbsp; within table
  cells was hosed (would be eaten up like
  any other WSP)</LI>
<LI> Cache: images are no longer kept in memory
  as raw stream data, thus wasting double
  memory (decoded and stream). Should be
  easily be reloaded from disk cache if
  a relayout of the image becomes necessary
  (due to screen change or stuff)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.38
<UL>
<LI> Net: added "about:verifylist" to get
  a list of verified cached URLs
  (debugging)</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: fixed mask bitplane
  allocation to not pass a friend bitmap
  (caused CGFX4 throwups)</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: hm, stupid design issue:
  when the lowmem handler was triggered
  because of the image decoder itself
  being unable to allocate bitmap
  data, it wouldn't free anything
  because the list sempahore was
  already locked. Erm. Not useful. Fixed.</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: Will now also release
  the image buffers when general free
  memory drops below 512k</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.39
<UL>
<LI> Imagedecoder: failure to allocate
  memory for a PNG image would call
  term_gif(), causing Havoc(tm)</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: wouldn't allocate a
  mask plane for background/alpha PNG
  images, but nevertheless render
  into it. Ahem.</LI>
<LI> Imagedecoder: Activated PNG Gamme correction.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.40
<UL>
<LI> SSL: added support for new
  voyager_ssl.vlib (port of
  OpenSSL 0.9.2b), currently with
  SSL v3 support only</LI>
<LI> SSL: upgraded certificates</LI>
<LI> JS: got DOM tree handling to work</LI>
<LI> JS-DOM: added "navigator" object</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.41
<UL>
<LI> JS-DOM: fixed a serious quirk
  in the object reference search
  code</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.42
<UL>
<LI> Layouter: &lt;HR WIDTH=0&gt;  would create
  an object with illegal dimensions
  (www.freshmeat.net)</LI>
<LI> Layouter: fixed form activation</LI>
<LI> Layouter: now figures out whether
  there were closed tables during
  incremental runs, and postpones
  rendering otherwise. Should speed
  up rendering esspecially of excessivly
  large HTML</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.43
<UL>
<LI> Layouter: URL escaping is now done
  with upper case hex digits, to work
  around broken cgi's which don't deescape,
  but do a 1:1 match</LI>
<LI> Layouter: fixed table nest calculation
  bug introduced in 2.96.42</LI>
<LI> JS_DOM: began implementing the "document"
  object</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.44
<UL>
<LI> Net: NULL ptr reference when converting
  dates with an unknown time zone (could
  happen with Cookies)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.45
<UL>
<LI> GUI: "About:" didn't show proper SSL
  library</LI>
<LI> JS: began adding "smart" property
  handling, i.e. properties which actually
  need underlying code to be fulfilled.
  Unfinished.</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.46
<UL>
<LI> Net: uninitialized "last URL got"
  variable could cause bogus pointer
  reference when switching documents</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.47
<UL>
<LI> Net: fixed handling of &lt;A TARGET=_new&gt;</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.48
<UL>
<LI> JS: added missing navigator properties</LI>
<LI> Net: optimized textual status report
  generation</LI>
<LI> Net: fixed an rather bizarre side-effect
  of partial URI Location: redirects
  causing enforcer hits in the network handler
  because the image deoders attempted
  to open the partial URL as a netstream</LI>
<LI> GUI: hopefully fixed all causes for crashes
  on iconify</LI>
<LI> GUI: source view now uses TI &quot;HTML&quot;
  style to highlite tags</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.49
<UL>
<LI> Cache: stops creating PROGDIR:Cache everytime (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> Net: cookies are now loaded properly if the Cache directory is different
  than PROGDIR:Cache (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: &quot;Cleanup list&quot; in Downloads window is faster (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: source view displays the URL in a TextinputObject (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: clicking on the leds opens the Network Status window (Zapek) </LI>
<LI> General: URLs without a scheme passed on the command line or via ARexx will
  now be prefixed with &quot;http://&quot; (KingGuppy)</LI>
<LI> GUI: &quot;Autoclose window?&quot; in the Downloads window is now saved with the
  prefs (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: added &quot;Save prefs on exit&quot; option (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: moved &quot;Ask for downloading dir&quot; menu into the prefs (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: added a &quot;Links&quot; section into the prefs (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: added a switch to stop the transfer animation immediately when there's
  no activity instead of waiting for the loop to complete (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> Bookmark: Now you can Add URLs to CManager. Adds it to the entry currently
  selected (Zapek)</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>2.96.50
<UL>
<LI> GUI: added percentage for downloads (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: Fixed &quot;Ask for downloading dir&quot; always being disabled (KingGuppy)</LI>
<LI> General: the URL is in the comment of a downloaded file (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> GUI: &quot;Autoclose window?&quot; is saved when you do it manually too (Zapek)</LI>
<LI> General: removed stale CM debugging code (Olli)</LI>
<LI> General: reenabled catalog loading, in preparation for a localisation
  fix (Olli)</LI>

  (may have caused crashes under certain circumstances) (Olli)</LI>
<LI> GUI: prefs window has now has additional frame with PageBack (Olli)</LI>
<LI> HTML: rewrote HTML parser from scratch. Should now be more robust
  against bizarre nuked tags, be much faster and gracefully deal with obscure
  quotation errors in argument values. This may fix several reported
  &quot;HTML errors&quot; (Olli)</LI>
<LI> Prefs: changed default background color to white (Olli)</LI>
<LI> GUI: fastlink buttons now accept dragged URLs and store them (Olli)</LI>
