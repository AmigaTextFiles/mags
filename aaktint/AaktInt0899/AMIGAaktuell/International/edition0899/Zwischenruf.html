<P>
The community ... the final frontier ... these are the voyages of the Amiga computer.
Users want nothing more, but a new Amiga. Their leader, Petro &quot;Luke&quot; Tyschtschenko boldly fights outnumbered against
a crowd of ignorants. In the last moment, when the situation was nearly lost, a new Deathstar raised the skies ... but one,
that fights on the same side as the rebels.
</P>
<P>
So or quite similar the events of the last months could be described. Meanwhile not much was heard from &quot;Luke&quot;.
Darthi-Boy has been chased away and ... the Amiga community is fell out as it never was before. The reason?
Amiga, led by Jim Collas, gave some informations to the community and surprises with the concepts about the child &quot;Amiga NG&quot;,
that will be born, which become more and more interesting. Phase 5 announced the cooperation with the RTOS developers of
QNX Inc., defiant and proud at the same time. And what does the community? They are discussing. The range of the Amigans moods
is from really angry to absolutely happy.
</P>
<P>
And what is with the two competing system concepts? Well, the better always was the enemy of the good one. And so it is
to wait, which concept will win. Any of the concerned persons have to learn: The (German) saying &quot;Wear warm clothes&quot;
will become true for any competitor, which also includes the leaders. And in Germany we are experienced in monopolies anyway ....
but also, what can become of them.
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosper .... scott me up, Beamy.
