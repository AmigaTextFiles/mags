<H1>The AMIGA-aktuell international competition</H1>
<H2>1. Results of the last competition</H2>
<P>
The last time there were 56 participants, so the number compared with the competition of June stayed on the same level.
</P>
<P>
Before we come to the solution, there is one notice: In this edition of AMIGA aktuell international there is an exceptional
second competition! In the games section there are two full versions of the space action strategy game Phoenix to be won.
</P>
<P>
But now, the solution:

No, 'no' wasn't correct! Because the widely spreaded that 'Java' would be the same as 'JavaScript' is not true, they are two completely different languages.<BR>
In opposition with that the aMozillaX specifications list with 'ECMAScript' a downcompatible successor of JavaScript, so the Master question had to be answered
with 'yes'.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>
One of the participants could not decide what to choose.
</P>
<P>
Some participants commented their answer of the Question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Andreas Garthof means: &raquo;A PPC-native AmigaOS would be fine...!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andr&ecute; Greif comments his refusing behavior like this: &raquo;If there's already a new beginning, then with power,
because we're gonna need it. If the new technology will really be as revolutionary as announced, there will be nearly
no Amiga fan, who don't want to have it. :-)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Kilian Servais is for further updates: &raquo;Everything else would be very deadly; alternatively it would be fine,
if the new OS would be adjusted to the PPC...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andreas Falkenhahn would prefer further updates, but is sceptic: &raquo; Yes, absolutely (but it is unlikely that there
will be more, because this will not be financeable due to the little number of customers! I would like to have a real
update (new ROM!!!). Imho the OS3.5 will become just a pack of well-knon software with new names...)
</P>
<P>
Marko Koscak comments it like this: &raquo;Yes, because I think, that the next Amiga generation will let us wait for some
time. But I think, that it will come!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolf Zimmer says 'No' with this comment: &raquo; In quite a short time there will just be PD software of teens, that operate
aged machines. So why take a Rolls Royce for picking up the rolls? The professionals swap to the NG-Amiga, if they should come.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt for Michael Alzheimer: &raquo;There should be further updates anyway, if the performance of the processor
allows it. Anyway, there should be further updates for m68k + PPC.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Marcus Castro couldn't decide: &raquo;This depends on how good the new Amiga will become. If it becomes a HighEnd game box as
the A500, then I stay with the Classic Amiga, of course, then with the lates OS, if possible. But if it becomes as good as in the
specs and there is still an overseeable and programmable (scripts) Workbench, then the energies schould be set on it and
the Classic Amiga left to the freaks.&laquo;
</P>
<H3>Conclusion:</H3>
<P>
The result is clear. A overwhelming majority wants new revisions of the Classic Amiga operating system. Looking back the
grouping of the mails, that reached me, was interesting. Because the first seven participants were with 5 to 2 votes against
further updates.
</P>
<P>
But now to the winners of the last competition:
