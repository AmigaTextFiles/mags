<H2>1. Progress report: Repair of an Iiyama monitor (by Oliver Schmidt)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Since a longer time I get angry about my Iiyama Vision Master Pro 400, even if the Amiga trade press praised the
monitors of Iiyama to the skies a several times. After a longer time it just didn't want to show an Amiga native resolutions,
a scandoubler or flicker fixer offers.
</P>
<P>
This was no problem for me with my A4000, because I didn't need AGA very often thanks to my graphics board. But now I got
the glorious idea of displaying my old and beloved OCS games on a monitor, that doesn't cause headaches after a longer
time of playing. Because the A2000 using a flicker fixer is only able of showing Amiga native resolutions, it was quite
bad, that these resolutions could be displayed after approx. 4 hours of work.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Well,&quot;, I thought,&quot; this monitor is just approx. 1 year old and the service documents show the 30 day exchange
warranty and 3 year pick-up-warranty. So I wrote an eMail to Iiyama, which was answered one day later. After one more eMail exchange
- at Iiyama it is unknown, that the monitors are favourized by Amigans - we agreed, that there was a defect. So they asked me
to call the free of charge hotline to make a pick-up date.
When I accepted this offer, I was surprised, that they offered a date for just one day later and I could choose, if the
monitor had to be picked up between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and between 12 p.m.-6 p.m. They also told me, that the repair would
need about 8-10 days.
</P>
<P>
The date in the morning was kept up - my monitor was picked up in the time period as it was promissed.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 10 days later the doorbell rang and my monitor was delivered right in the time period, but I was curious, that
the delivery wasn't announced, before. However, it works without any problem, now.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: This first-classes and uncomplicated service should be a good example to other manufacturers/dealers - especially
the German dealers. Some companies in Germany have to catch up with that.
