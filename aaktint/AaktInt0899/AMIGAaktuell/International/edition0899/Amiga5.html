<H2>5. Dr. Rick LeFaivre and Dr. Allan Havemose speak to the Community</H2>
<P>
</P>
Very interesting and active debate over the past two weeks.  We *love*
the passion of (most of ;-)) the on-line community.  Linux?  X-
Windows?  PCI?  USB?  MIDI?  Floppy Drive?  ATI graphics, etc., etc.
While an overwhelming percentage of our email is quite positive about
Amiga's directions, there are those who have raised quite legitimate
technical concerns, and a small percentage who are just bashing
everything we do (more on them later).
</P><P>
One positive aspect of the Linux announcement is the huge influx of
technical talent into the Amiga camp from the Linux community.  There
are legitimate issues with Linux, as anyone with a technical background
will acknowledge.  One positive aspect of the Linux phenomenon is that
there are hundreds of thousands of programmers out there working to fix
those problems.  There are also hundreds of companies working on
applications and drivers (and hardware) for Linux, that we can
immediately tap into.  Yes, there are integration and testing issues to
work on, but there are many, many more positives than negatives.
Please understand that the Linux decision was not purely (actually not
mostly) a technical decision.  It was a decision driven by a reasoned
analysis of what underlying OS would give Amiga the greatest chance to
succeed in the marketplace, and as a company.
</P><P>
Also understand that we have not yet seen a single technical issue
raised in the news groups that we are not already aware of, and working
on either inside of Amiga or through partners.  Will the Amiga MCC
under development be perfect?  Of course not -- product development is
all about tradeoffs.  When it is shipping, will it be at the heart of
the best distributed multimedia computing environment in the
marketplace in terms of price/performance/usability?  Yes!  Even more
important, the MCC is only one piece of a much broader strategy that we
have chosen to not really discuss yet.  When Jim Collas talks about
revolutions, it's not a revolution in terms of what happens to be
inside the MCC box (although some of the unannounced components are,
indeed, revolutionary); it's the entire distributed home
computing/Internet environment and experience that will be
revolutionary as it rolls out over the coming year.  DON'T JUST FOCUS
ON BOXES AND OPERATING SYSTEMS!  (sorry for shouting.)
</P><P>
So, to those of you raising legitimate technical concerns, we will do
our best to communicate solutions as they are worked out.  Better yet,
help us track down those solutions.  Linux is getting better every
week, with issues getting resolved at an amazing pace.  ATI may not be
able to ship their new graphics/video accelerator (which looks great)
on time, and rest assured that we're also looking at 3dfx and NVidea.
Yes, there will be a floppy drive (probably a 1.44MB / 120MB combo).
We're working on the sound/MIDI requirements.  We're listening to
proactive suggestions, and will do our best to manage the inevitable
tradeoffs to create the best next-generation system we can.
</P><P>
To the small number of individuals who have been sending vulgar,
threatening hatemail because you don't like what we're doing, and have
announced that you're fed up and are leaving the Amiga community,
goodbye.  Millions and millions of people will purchase Amiga-branded
and Amiga-compliant products over the coming years, and we're sorry you
won't be among them.
