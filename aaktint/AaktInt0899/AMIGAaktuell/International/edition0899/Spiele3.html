<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell games section in the middle of the silly season, even if thereis nothing in
sight of it, because this edition has reviews of Wasted Dreams, Moonbases, Superfrog, Civilization II, Pirates Gold,
Exile III and Doktor 1.1. In addition there will be an interview with Jens Neubauer, the programmer of seaside. But this
will not be all: This month there are an additional Mac corner by Andreas Koch, a comment regarding the Napalm game test
by Ioannis Nikitopoulos, a preview regarding The last Seal, a competition and, of course, the rest of the news.
</P>
<P>
Who is curious, that there are test of games like Civilization II, that don't exist for the Amiga should consider,
that there is a Mac-corner, presented by Andreas Koch. Because this is work, he is looking for people, who help him
with that. Please read his summons in the Mac-corner.
</P>
<P>
Now we have our own competiton in the games section. The APC&amp;TCP gave us two copies of their game Phoenix and
asks for many participation. So, participate, please.
</P>
<P>
This month there will be a late comment regarding the Napalm test by Ioannis Nikitopulos, that should have been published,
before. I'm sorry, Ioannis!
</P>
<P>
In addition Crusaderluechow asked me to publish, that he is looking for the code tests fo these games (why so ever):
Das schwarze Auge, The Clou, Burntime, Inherit the earth and PGA Tour Golf. Who has anything of that can contact him
directly &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Crusaderluechow@t-online.de">Crusaderluechow@t-online.de</A>&gt; or me.
</P>
<P>
On my summons in the last AMIGA aktuell some eMails entered my mailbox. It wasn't a million, but there was some
feedback. Many asked me to remove the dust of the release list. I did that. Everything was new ordered and all the games
you don't hear anything of, are within an extra section. In addition all the AmigaNG games are within a seperate section.
</P>
<P>
Actually I wanted to put in this edition some reviews of Wet, Speccy and the Prophet. But unfortunately there lack of time
prevented this, so that you will be able to read these reviews in the next edition. But I think, that this edition offers
enough to read. The charts could not actualized this month, because there weren't any released. Also the news from the
Aminet are not complete, because the mailing list was out of service.
</P>
<P>
So, then have fun with this edition,
