<H2>2. AMIGA releases further concept drawings - your opinions</H2>
<P>
In the first days of July AMIGA released further concept drawings regarding the AmigaNG. The subscribers of the AMIGA-aktuell international
graphics got it at once attached to a Special with the request for their opinons.
</P>
<P>
The concepts were evaluated quite different, but it was expected to be that way:
</P>
<P>
Oliver Schmidt doesn't favorize them:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;The idea, to make the keyboard disappear under the central unit as it was with the A1000, is quite ergonomic. But I
think, the drawings go into the direction of the iMac - nice to watch, but too playful and little expandable. Don't they
think about and expandable tower model? Or is it up to the users to pay about 300 - 600 Marks (approx. 153.06 - 306.12 Euros)
to get use of the computer?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg thinks, that the drawing mean little:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Well, these hand drawn sketches do not mean much, so someone could not get enthusiastic about the. It is very likely,
that they are the result of a brainstorming, but I think that as a working environment, home appliance or however they are
going to call the new Amiga, it should fit into the living room. The right one for me is the old cube, which can be hidden
under the desk. On the desk there are that many things in addition to the monior (ZIP drive, genlock, video recorder - sometimes
two, television set, pin printer, colour printer, pen plotter, printer switch + small Pee Cee), so I have no use for something
that is styled.
</P>
<P>
But my deepest pity is the last Collas- + Amiga report. Pity, because I belong to the ancient Amiga fans (I am 73 years old) and
I will not be able to really enjoy the new Amiga. In the old age you lack of some abilities - physical as well as mental.
If the AmigaNG is just half as good as promissed, it is a hit! I remember those days, when I got enthusiastic about the
first Amiga and, of course, I will swap to the new one.
</P>
<P>
I hope, that younger people will feel the same joy, when it offers them the (hopefully) better posibilities for being creative
than other platforms, as it did the ancient Amiga in the old days.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andreas Frank is enthusiastic about the designs:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I think, all of the concepts of Amiga are great. But concepts are always great, but that doesn't mean, that the
series has to. Anyway, I like the designs from picture 1 and picture 9 most. But they should stay a bit cubic, for practical
purposes. It should be possible (at least in theory) to put a monitor on it. If you ask me, I like Big towers better, anyway, but
if the case will look that brilliant as it does on the drawings, I would like to make some space on my desk.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
What I really didn't like at all was the 15&quot; monitor on one of the drawings. Is this supposed to be multimedia? No.
Of course, not. You shouldn't start with anything smaller than 17&quot;. (Even better: LCD would be state-of-the-art for
a modern multimedia computer, anyway: TVout should not be forgotten!)&laquo; (remark of the editor: It wasn't, as you might
read in the <A HREF="../edition0799/Amiga4.html">technology paper of the AmigaNG</A> from the last edition.)
</P>
<P>
Mark Buofrate doesn't like the concept drawings at all:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;It is just bad - ist the NG-Amiga supposed to become a game console or an expandable, nice workstation? I would like a
quite normal tower version better - I cannot get used to the idea of these desktop console concepts - and neither with the
pseudo-iMac version...
</P>
<P>
Do they always have to start with idiotism like that? Wasn't there enough to laugh about, when the &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;
was supposed to &quote;revolutionate&quot; the market?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Thomas Franziskowski likes the concepts very much:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Today I watched the concept drawings for the Amiga NG and I have to say: I like them very much (,but the last one
&quot;frame&quot; a little bit less). Such a nice design would be another argument to buy this computer.
</P>
<P>
I would find a keyboard without cable (connected by infra-red), as the drawings indicate, very nice.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the forms the colours and the metal front plate are very nice.
</P>
<P>
Handhelds with well handable lateral surfaces, would be fine. Especiall in this matter there should be taken a good look
regardin the ergonomy.
</P>
<P>
But I wonder, how someone is supposed to put a monitor on the &quot;jetson&quot; (due to the uneven sufrace). Only a few
might like to place the monitor next to it. On the other hand: Maybe I don't think flexible enough...?
The drawing &quot;techtonic&quot; reminds me of the case of the Sony Playstation. The remark &quot;DVD&quot; sounds
very interesting!
The idea of being able to move the keyboard under the desktop case is very practically and is very welcome!
By the way, my favorite is the &quot;kyoto&quot; case! It is really a jewel!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Martin Henke sees similarities to two existing computers:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;The new concept drawings remind me of two different computers:<BR>
a) the Amiga 1000 (namely 01_kyoto.jpg, 02_frame.jpg, 03_audi_tt.jpg, 11_jetson.jpg, 05_techtonica.jpg)
b) the iMac (namely 02_kyoto.jpg, 06_techtonica.jpg, 16_starck.jpg, 17_starck.jpg).
</P>
<P>
Why? Well, a) reminds me of the A1000, because it also was flat and it was possible to move the keyboard below it, too.
Unfortunately it was not very expandable.
</P>
<P>
b) reminds me of the iMac, because everything (including the monitor) is integrated into one device.
</P>
<P>
If both concepts are pleasing to the customer may be without interest, because this is due to anyones personal likes.
But I think, that both will not be very good for expandng. I hope, that there will be a tower. If it fits right into
the line - fine. If not, it's fine, too - at least the computer can be expanded.
</P>
<P>
But I think, that a tower doesn't need very much plans and that just the &quot;designed&quot; case concepts are shown.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Uwe Mann expects the danger of thermal problems:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I personally would prefer the pictures 05_techtonica and 20_frame, because: it was indicated, that they don't want
to make the same invention twice. But where are the xtensions from the PC sector supposed to be put into? The new high power
graphics boards produce a lot of heat, where should it be moved to? Even the maxi towers in the Wintel-PC-sector have problems
with that... These should be quite impossible with the other cases. Or doesn't an NG-Amiga need any??
All the concepts look great, but some have a similarity to the iMAC. This should be avoided of all cost. An NG-Amiga should
be clearly identified, as well as you see an iMac, you know at once: Ah, that's an iMac.
</P>
<P>
It seems to be clear, that in the end the new Amiga will not be related to the Amiga of today. Just the idea 'computer is
not equal Windows' remains.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Klaus Lehberger shortens his opinion into one sentence:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I nearly like anything, if just the &quot;interior&quot;  ;-)
is right...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Rainer Lunge doesn't believe, that the cases of the AmigaNG computers will look that way:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I don't like concept drawings ver much. They show futuristic cases, but if those will join the series isn't clear.
The concept cars of the automobile industry can be compared with these drawings. They are also futuristic design studies,
but where is the concept car, which was complete put into the series? I don't now any.
</P>
<P>
In addition of that, I think that the case is not the argument for the AmigaNG. Much more important is a revolutionary interior
and a revolutionary operating system&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Mark Nickel has one favorite_
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I think, 11-Jetson is the best case concept, even if it is a different colour (maybe there should be some you can
choose from as it is with the iMac). The good thing of this concept is the possibility to move the keyboard under the
computer; a nice innuendo to the A1000.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Kess likes a more conventional design better:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Well, it's nice. It reminds me of the iMac... and if people are going to like that? I personally would like something
in the design of the Infinitive tower... the designs seem to be a bit expensive. :)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
The drawings are in the bad books of Markus Castro:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I think, that the designs are partly horrible! Not, that they were drawn bad or something like that (what other
people critisized...), no: The design - it might remind me of the Playstation or the iMac. If AMIGA puts really such a
computer on the market - most people will recognize it as a console only, and then the Amiga gets the image of a game box,
again. If AMIGA really brings out a revolutionary box, they should sell it as a professional machine and not as a set-top-box
or console.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Klaus G. Schmitt has an idea, that's quite interesting:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I find the concepts &quot;a bit futuristic&quot;, but I think, that they will have a good response. But I'm interested
in something, that isn't shown in the drawing: will there be &quot;individuality&quot;? If we showed 100 Classic-Amigas,
nearly any AMIGA would be unique due the individual combination of the hardware components. Of course, this can handicap,
if a program doesn't run on any AMIGA. This handicap should be history with the new generation AMIGAs.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Peter Drexler thinks, that one part of the concept is well done, the other one, not:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Some of the pictures are shocking, but most of them enjoy. Now, something has to happen, because else the time is up
for AmigaNG.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Rene Wunderlich tells us extended, what he thinks:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Oh, they all look fine, but some of them remind me of other manufacturers, what I don't like very much. ;(
</P>
<P>
MAC did it with their own line and I would say, that AMIGA should also try it that way.
</P>
<P>
I would prefer 01_kyoto.jpg, 03_audi_tt.jpg, BUT
</P>
<P>
02_kyoto.jpg, 06_techtonica.jpg, 17_starck.jpg
might be very interesting for AMIGA beginners, because they are complete solutions.
</P>
<P>
11_jetson.jpg, 05_techtonica.jpg, 28_frame.jpg
look very similar to a PSX-like device, and that is name GAME console. ;(
</P>
<P>
I expect, that AMIGA will not have any influence in the game sector and shouldn't try to conquer this sector, but put their
targets to other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Because s0ny and n1ntend0 can no longer beaten, &quot;I think&quot;, due to the power their devices have and will have.
Maybe there will not be any computer, that is as fast as they are, nor will the range of games. And no one might want it
to become like on the PC, so you have to buy a new PC after 2 months, DO YOU?
NO, OF COURSE NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</P>
<P>
The handling should be easy, colourful and practicalle, expandable for up to 4 years. ;)
</P>
<P>
Then new USERS will come and with them more buying power and more money, and with money advertising, so there are new users
and so on.
</P>
<P>
If it was just that easy, hahahahaha ;), but IBM and microdoze show again, that advertising is everything.&laquo;
