&nbsp;<BR>[snip - relevant rant from well intentioned person]<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Warning! I deserve to right to rant once in a while also so here I go: <BR>&nbsp;<BR>I know that we still have to improve communication but visibly<BR>communicating with a large community is difficult. I expend a<BR>significant amount of effort listening to and understanding the Amiga community. I have spent 100s of hours in the last several months listening to and corresponding with the Amiga community. Here are some of the activities:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1) I met with over 100 Amigans in multiple groups in St. Louis to listen to input.<BR>2) I have met with multiple groups around the U.S. to get input. I have held several press conferences to get input.<BR>3) I flew to Germany and the U.K. in May specifically to meet with 60 to 70 prominent Amigans and listen to input. Multiple feedback session of several hours.<BR>4) I met with key Amiga developers in U.K. and Germany.<BR>5) I read the most popular Amiga newsgroups

 daily.<BR>6) We have started Amiga sponsored forums to get input.<BR>7) I read over 100 emails a day from the Amiga community and reply to many of them.<BR>8) I talk to people in the Amiga community many times a week.<BR>9) Bill McEwen and Darreck Lisle read 100s of email a day and compile the common inputs and questions fo me and other executives.<BR>10) We are establishing an Amiga Advisory Council consisting of<BR>prominant Amigans that were nominated by the community.<BR>11) etc ...<BR>&nbsp;<BR>As you can see I have had 1000s of interactions with the Amiga<BR>community. I wonder if anyone realizes how much effort this is on top of running the company. I wonder if anyone realizes how much travel this is away from my family. I do this because I care about what you think. I listen to the community and think deeply about the input as I set the plans. In order to better understand our plans, there are a few things people should consider:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1) There are many differing opini

ons in the community about what to do. Many times people are pulling in opposite directions.<BR>2) There isn't a single consistent set of requirements from the<BR>community.<BR>3) I am trying to make up for several years of flawed decisions. This has made the situation very difficult. Because of the delay we can't just evolve a product line like most companies would. This also means I inherited a community with little patience (understandable).<BR>4) There are a significant number of variables to consider and its impossible to communicate them all publicly.<BR>5) There are many things that the community doesn't know relative to new technology advancements.<BR>6) We can't share all of our strategic plans publicly.<BR>7) This is an extremely difficult industry to compete in. There are many big players with deep pockets. Microsoft just passed the $500B value mark. We can't just waltz in with a &quot;me too&quot; strategy. 8) We are basically building company from scratch, not just a prod

uct. Do people realize how difficult this is to do quickly.<BR>9) There are constraints on budget and resources. We are working as effectively and diligently as we can.<BR>10) There are people that will blast whatever we do. No matter what we do. It's unfortunate for me but they are understandably fed up because of the past.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I know it's frustrating but don't judge me on the last several years. These were screwed up and I didn't have anything to do with it. Judge me on the last 5 months. I am driving Amiga in a way that it hasn't been driven in a long time. As an aggressive, independent, and<BR>visionary company. I am balancing technology, business, marketing, and industry dynamics to come up with a plan that gives us a great chance at being a driving force in the computer industry again. We are in a very difficult predicament and I am defining a very strong plan to get us out. It is not easy to understand all of the variables that go into this plan. It's even more difficu

lt to communicate it publicly. This plan requires complex compromises and prioritization and not everyone will understand or agree. Also remember, the first product out is not the end of our roadmap. The only thing I can assure you is that I do care about the community and I listen. I will drive relentlessly and aggressively to bring back Amiga as a driving force. There is 101 things I can do with my career but this is what I have passion for. I need the Amiga community behind me on this or we will fail. We have one last shot. We can't afford to be diverted or distracted. We MUST stand united to succeed.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thanks for listening.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Sincerely,<BR>Jim<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
