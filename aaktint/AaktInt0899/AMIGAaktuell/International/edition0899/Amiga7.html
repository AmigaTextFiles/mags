<B>July 22, 1999 - San Diego California - </B>Today, Amiga announced that they are working closely with Corel Corporation to insure that several of Corel's award winning software applications will be supported on Amiga's new line of products that are scheduled for release later this year.  

<P>This announcement follows Amiga's recent announcement that they have selected Linux as the OS kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment.   "We are extremely excited about our relationship with Corel and their entire product line", said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga, "This insures that our customers who purchase the new Amiga systems will have world class personal productivity applications such as the upcoming WordPerfect Office for Linux."  

<P>Customers have made over 1 million download attempts for <B>Corel&reg; WordPerfect&reg; 8 for Linux&reg; </B>since Corel made the product available on their web site last December.  "We expected the Linux version to do well," said Dr. Michael Cowpland, Chief Executive Officer and President of Corel, "but one million download attempts is extraordinary. Not only does it speak volumes for WordPerfect, I think it is somewhat indicative of the growing popularity of Linux.  We expect the release of WordPerfect Office for Linux will be an even greater success when we release it early next year."

<P>As Amiga approaches the release dates of the new Amiga Operating Environment and the Amiga MCC (Multimedia Convergence Computer), we will be announcing more details on these and other products and their availability dates.
