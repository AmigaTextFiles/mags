<LI> Hyperion Software brings Heretic II
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Hyperion Software has licensed another 3D shooter. This time it is the game Heretic from Activision. Heretic II is based
on the Qu??? II engine of ID software and was a complete success on the PC (nearly just evaluations higher than 90%).
Logically this game requires PowerPC, graphics board and CD-ROM. On the Hyperion Software homepage a progress report
regarding Shogo, that shows the current status of the port was released.

<LI> clickBOOM brings Nightlong
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
According to informations from clickBOOM, they will release the largest game for the Amiga, ever created. 3 complete CDs
will be filled in the final version, that was released on the PC by Team 17 in 1998. Maybe, that the Amiga version will be
ready by the end of this year. That a game on 3 CDs will offer a lot of graphics should be clear for anyone. So we can
be happy about many sequences as well as 16 bit Cyberpunk graphics.

<LI> Foundation wird weiterentwickelt
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Shortly, after Paul Burky announced, that he will not further develop Foundation, because there was e.g. a retreat of
the publisher Sadeness, there was the big clear signal. After a talk with another Amiga publisher on the World of Amiga
Paul Burkey decided to further develop Foundation. The new version, which is expected to be released late this year
will not be just re-release, but a completely revised revision. These things are on the list:
<UL>
<LI> new programming in portable C/C++ code</LI>
<LI> PowerPC support</LI>
<LI> new levels</LI>
<LI> new music and sound and more</LI>
</UL>
Also the long awaited TCP/IP support will be included in the next update.

<LI> Bad joke of Team 17
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Big excitement was created with an announcement by Team 17, that told they planned a port of Worms Armageddon for the
Amiga. All this should be released on 17 floppy disks. When asking Team 17, they explained that this was just a jokeky
(british humour....) and that Worms Armageddon will just be made available for the Amiga NG. However, this would not be
done by Team 17, but from another company.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Space Station 3000 release will be delayed
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The release of the realtime space strategy game Space Station 3000 from Digital Images will be delayed for another 1 to
2 months. Stuart Walker said, that it can be assured, that Space Station 3000 will become the best strategy game for
the Amiga and the PC.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Operation Counterstrike Demo will be delayed
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In the beginning the playable demo version of Operation Counterstrike was announced for the World of Amiga, but due to some
bugs in the game they decided not to publish a demo, yet. But they expect, that they will be able to offer it for download
on their homepage.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Tales from Heaven News
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
According to Darkage Software, the authors of the Mario64 clone Tales from Heaven the game is nearly ready. On the World
of Amiga a final version is supposed to be shown. The game is expected to become available from Epic marketing in no time.
Another game of the group, namely Alive, a shoot 'em up game in the style of ProjectX and Turrican has been temporary
paused. They want to ask the users using a election system on the homepage in this matter, if Alive will be further
developped. They are also working on another game, but there aren't any details, yet. But it would become a hit, that
will shock the Amiga users, as Tales of Heaven did.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Game development for the Amiga NG
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A basic question with game announcements for the Amiga NG during the last month was: How can someone develop games for a
computer, that doesn'þ even exist? AmigaFlame used the opportunity to ask Digital Images and Delsyd, how they develop
their Amiga NG games without an Amiga NG. The answers were nearly the same from both companies: They develop the games
completely in easy-portable C on PPC/WarpOS, so that the final version could be released for a new system, the Amiga NG,
quite quickly. In addition Delsyd Software uses OpenGL, which simplifies the porting, too.

<LI> Q-Lab is looking for programmers
</LI>
</UL>
<BR>
Q-Lab is looking for programmers, who can program preferable in C/C++ or ASM, for programming Po Po Chicken. You are paid
for your work and get the final version of the game for free. They are also looking for progrmmers for the game WEL, but
this game may only be programmed in C, because the game will also be released for the PC. You have to be experienced with
3D programming and also using the existing 3D engine. If you are interested, contact
Will Morton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:q@qlab.swinternet.co.uk">q@qlab.swinternet.co.uk</A>&gt;.

two player modes, is shipped on CD-ROM and can be paid for about 45.00 DEM (approx. 22.96 Euros) from Alive Mediasoft. In

<LI> T Zer0 released
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
clickBOOM released the new Shoot 'em up T-Zer0. It was developped by an Italian team and the final version needs more
than 100 MB of storage, but is hipped (fortunately) on CD-ROM. In addition there are animated sequences and other nice
things. With some luck you will be able to read a test in the next edition.

</UL>
<P>
Pagan Software planned a demo of the Zelda like game Dafel Bloodline for the World of Amiga, because the development
of the game runs fine. Unfortunately the space action game Scavengers has been completed for approx. 25%. The latest
announcement, the 3D strategy Magerick will need a PowerPC. In addition they are looking urgently for PPC/WarpOS programmers
as well as 3D graphics. If you are interested contact Jason Hayman &lt;<A HREF="mailto:caradog@pagan-games.com">caradog@pagan-games.com</A>&gt;.
