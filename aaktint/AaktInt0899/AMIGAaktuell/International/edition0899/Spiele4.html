<h2>4.Manni Froitzheim´s comment on the Napalm-Test (by I. Nikitopoulos)</h2>

<p>Right on Manni Froitzheim! Only because there haven't been any
good Amiga-Games for a while you really don't have to like just
anything! I got the impression that the few games that came out
recently, are just taking advantage of this situation and made
for getting the fast bucks.. </p>

<p>Tons of graphics don't make a good game. In different PC or
PCX-Magazines I have seen great previews (wow amazing
graphics)several times but when the game got released it turned
out to be boring, a total flop. Does it always have to be a fancy
appearance to be something good? No! Caviar looks like sh** and
the rich and beautiful just love it. </p>

<p>Siedler, one of the all time best games, does it have great
graphics or any special sound effects? I don't think so.</p>

<p>A lot more exited than about one of those &quot;click, boom
,gone&quot; games, I am about Imperium Terranum Part 2, the first
one already was excellent and has been one of my favorites games
for quiet a while now.</p>

<p>That it's too much for an Amiga, especialy with a minimum
configuration of AGA,020er, 8MB Ram and CD-ROM on the cover
(Quake) shouldn't be a surprise for anybody. In such a case the
game should only be worth DM 30. Not that anyone tells me now ' I
got a 060er and graphiccard' everybody that has this hardware and
played this game knows that this can be expected too much.</p>

<p>For DM100 I rather buy a PSX-title, like last Friday the
Civilization 2.there I found an average ECS-Graphic, the standard
Amiga-sound and all kinds of game-technique quality, a game that
tells you &quot;push me in and you´ll have some nice hours of
fun facing you!&quot;</p>

<p>I am not the &quot;back to the basics&quot; kind of person but
gameproducers shouldn´t go backwards but learn and improve the
existing. instead games are released that produce never known
problems for an Amiga. </p>

<p>The user ain´t no beta-tester and shouln´t freak about
everything crossing his way! About everything that Amiga
(Inc/Int) does are the critics and most of the time it´s
complaining just because. Games like Napalm get overrated,
&quot;shouldn´t we be glad there is a new game for us!&quot;</p>
