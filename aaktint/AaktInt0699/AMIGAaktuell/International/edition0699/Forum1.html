<H2>1. progress report regarding various dealers (by Wolfgang W. Wolber)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;After there always were reports about negative experiences with some (especially one ;-) ) company in the Amiga sector,
I just want to make a comment.
</P>
<P>
But first, unfortunately, something negative:
</P>
<P>
Haage &amp; Partner (whose involement I usually appreciate):
</P>
<P>
January 27, 1999 I ordered a PCX/Fusion bundle, on January 30, 1999 I got PCX plus a disk with the German guides of PCX
and Fusion, but Fusion couldn't be located anywhere (no, it wasn't on the same disk as PCX).
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">So I inquired about it per eMail (sent from the automatic server to various addresses, because errors can occur :)), approx.
3 days later I inquired also per post.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Until today there hasn't been a reaction (later I sent another two eMails, one to Juergen Haage).
</P>
<P>
Due to the quite low value (the difference of the bundle price and the single prices of PCX and the seperate price of Fusion)
I didn't take any legal steps and ordered Fusion from KDH (more to them later).
</P>
<P>
That there wasn't a reply on my mail to Mr. Haage, I can understand due to his efforts with OS3.5 etc., but that the post
resp. complaint department replied with at least an acknowledgement of receipt doesn't sound as serving the customer. :-(
</P>
<P>
But now to something more positive:
</P>
<P>
This would lead to the (unfortunately for a longer time no longer existing) company Donau-Soft.
</P>
<P>
There I bought in 1995 a socalled &quot;Turbo-Memory-Board&quot; (i.e. a memory extension with an overclocked 68020 plus 4 MB of RAM
(SIMM) for my A1200. Lamer, I was at that time, I didn't recognize, that the SIMM module was built-in when delivered and promptly inquired
the missing of it.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hauer, the owner of the company called me and informed me (very politely!) of my error and gave me a lot of tips.
</P>
<P>
Well, es menioned before, this company unfortunately no longer exists..
</P>
<P>
Next one to mention is the company KDH-Datentechnik, especially their Mr. Guenther Horbach.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998 I requested an offer for an Infinitive 1500 with Cyberstorm PPC and Picasso IV.
</P>
<P>
Two days later the written offer reached me, so I ordered the box at once. With the acknowledgement of receipt I was informed,
that the deliverey could be delayed, due to the Computer 98 show which would result in delivery problems of Micronik.
</P>
<P>
When there wasn't an A1500 in my home in the mid of November 1998 I got a phone call (around 9 p.m.) from KDH, that p5 didn't have
any <A HREF="mailto:604@233">604@233</A> and if I would accept an 200 PPC.
</P>
<P>
When I asked 14 days later per eMail for the whereabouts of my device Mr. Horbach promptly answered, that there were technical
difficulties, which meant, that the box didn't boot after any switch-on; they would deliver it anyway, but I could send it back
due to these problems anytime.
</P>
<P>
So it happened, as I found out later there were problems in cooperation of the Micronic Z3 board with the A1200 motherboard.
Within the 3 months (from January 1999 to April 1999), in which the tower was a KDH for checking I wrote numerous eMails to them,
which Mr. Horbach answered most politely and mostly at once, sometimes even on the weekend or late in the evening)
</P>
<P>
When the problem was found out they delivered an A4000T (with the CSPPC and PIV) instead of hte Infinitive and it works
mostly without problems (when one problem occured shortly after the delivery, Guenther H. also gave me some tips). As a
(cite of Mr. Horbach) &quot;compensation for the long delay&quot; the IDE devices (hard disk and CD-ROM) originally built in
the Infinitive were exchanged against SCSI devices.
</P>
<P>
To cut a long story short: If someone understood the meaning of &quot;servicing the customer&quot; then it is Mr. Horbach
and KDH and that's why I'm going to from KDH, if I need something for my Lady, even if another company sells it eventually
for some bucks less.
</P>
