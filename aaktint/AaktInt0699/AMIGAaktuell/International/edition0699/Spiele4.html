<LI> Hyperion Software ports Shogo for Amiga
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Who watched the PC game market during the last month should have noticed the new 3D shoote Shogo by Monolith.
Well, just this one is ported to the Amiga. The team is a German/Belgian cooperation of the group Hyperion,
in which there are e.g. Thomas and Hans-Joerg Frieden (ADescent, Warp3D...) as well as Christian Sauer
(Descent, Heretic...). Shogo is superior to Quake 2 with its graphics. No wonder, that the Amiga version has need of a
PowerPC. Shogo is expected to be published mid/end of 1999.

<LI> Next Monolith conversion announced: Rages of Mages
</LI>
</UL>

Sanios Software got the rights to convert the real time strategy spectacle Rages of Mages. The high end strategy game

website they soon want to put the demo into the Aminet.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Wasted Dreams available soon
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
According to Digital Images the final version of Wasted Dreams has been sent for pressing it on CD, so it is likely there
are just some days until the final publishing. Wasted Dreams was previously named Distant Dreams, but because it was cancelled
by the original developers, Digital Images took over the game and named it Wasted Dreams.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Digital Images is negotiating again
</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<LI> Alive Mediasoft brings Goal 2000
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Alive Mediasoft wants to re-release the soccer classic Goal and publish it as Goal 2000. There won't be many changes, so
someone can be sceptic, if it is going to run on any Amiga, because the old Goald had problems with fast processors.
