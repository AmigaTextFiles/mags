Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell international.
</P>
<P>
As you noticed in the 'Headlines of the Month', that is by the way a new part of the preface, some things were done at
AMIGA. But that cannot be said about the common Amiga market: There were nearly no important news in the last month,
even not regarding the theme G3/G4. Maybe this is an announcement of the summer slack period.
