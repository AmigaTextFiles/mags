Preface:
<P>
The Swiss Computer Fun (name still can be changed) is going to be a big computer meeting in the area of Bile/Bern/Solothurn!
It is going to take place in April (late April) in 2000! This meeting will have any computer type (AMIGA, Windows, Linux, Mac,
etc.) to tal about the latest, best and fastest, to play games and to participate of nice competitions, to watch various seminars,
etc!!! It'll become fun! PS: Just bring your darling with you!
Of course there will be various shows, competition, demos, music and a small snack and drink booth!
</P>
<P>
With some luck we are going to get a video wall (controlled by an AMIGA 4000) and maybe some more personalities of the computer
branch will come! Programmers are going to show there latest works; and... get surprised!!! And the best: with some luck there
is a network with a connection to the web of webs, the World Wide Web (short: www) for free use! So, just take a computer with
network card and cables with you or use one of the freely accessible surf compies... and the fun starts!
