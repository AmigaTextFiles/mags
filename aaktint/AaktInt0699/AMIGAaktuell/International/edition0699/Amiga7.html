<B>4.   When is the development system scheduled for shipment?</B><BR><BR>

A.      As we move closer to the Q4 ship date, we will be releasing more information about the complete Amiga Operating Environment and the supporting development system.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>6.   Which processor has been selected for the development system?</B><BR><BR>
A. In order to shorten our time to release, we expect to release the initial development environment on the X.86 architecture. We will ensure that we have all the development tools, libraries, etc. necessary to explore and begin development on the new Amigas. Please note, that using X.86 as a development system doesn't mean that we have selected an x86 architecture for the new Amiga.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>7.   What development tools will be available for the development system?</B><BR><BR>

A. C++ and Java are the primary languages, supporting a rich set of Amiga objects.
More specific details will be released in July.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>8.   Is Java2 part of OS5?</B><BR><BR>

A. Yes, we feel that Java2 offers significant advantages for portable applications.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>9.   Will  existing Amiga dealers sell the development system?</B><BR><BR>

A. We will be working with the Amiga dealer channel to arrange for them to deliver the new Amiga products.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>10.  Is the next generation Amiga still scheduled to ship Christmas 1999?</B><BR><BR>

A. Yes, we are still targeting to ship by Q4 this year. We are working through the precise product launch plans, but plan to release the product globally.<BR><BR><BR>


<B>11. Which processor has been selected for the next generation Amiga?</B><BR><BR>

The final decision on the processor for the Next Generation Amiga has not been made. There are several under consideration, and we are continuing our process of evaluation and feature comparisons.  <BR><BR><BR>

<B>12.  When will we begin seeing advertising for the next generation Amiga?</B><BR><BR>

A. We do not expect to do any external advertising for the new Amiga until there are products available through our distribution channels.  We are still some months away from that so there are no definitive plans for the advertising program.   We do intend to communicate product availability and other company activities through the established Amiga channels of communication prior to general market communications. <BR><BR><BR>

<B>13.  Will Amiga have a presence at Comdex this year? </B><BR><BR>

A. We are planning activities at the several of the Amiga and general industry events.  The successful participation in a trade show like Fall Comdex involves a lot of advance planning and having the right message at the right time in order to gain visibility above the noise level at that show.   As we get closer to Comdex, we will disclose our plans for participation.  <BR><BR><BR>

<B>14.  How do we become beta testers to the next generation Amiga?</B><BR><BR>

A. The Beta program for the next generation product has not been defined yet.  We expect to make this information available by late summer.
