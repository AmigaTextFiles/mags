Dear Amigans,<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="thumb/lefaivre.jpg" ALT="Rick LeFaivre" WIDTH=242 HEIGHT=193 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">
I thought it would be appropriate for me to "introduce" myself to the Amiga community, having joined the new Amiga in April as chief technology officer and senior VP of R&D.  Just as Jim Collas is opening up communications channels as our new CEO, I'll try to communicate as openly as I can about Amiga's technology vision and directions.<BR><BR>
First, a little about my background, and why I'm at Amiga.  I wrote my first computer program (on an IBM 1620) in 1966, and got my first job as a (student) programmer in 1967.  Over the past 32 years, I've been privileged to participate in the evolution of computing from the mainframe to the minicomputer to the personal computer to the Internet.  I started my career as a computer science professor doing research in artificial intelligence and advanced programming environments (LISP, SmallTalk, and an AI language I developed in the early 70's called FUZZY).  I moved into industrial R&D in 1978, and over the years have directed R&D organizations at companies such as Tektronix, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, Silicon Graphics and Borland International (now Inprise).  At Apple, where I oversaw advanced technology R&D, we pioneered technologies such as QuickTime, PlainTalk, QuickTime-VR, and a host of other innovations that were subsequently copied by our friends at a large software comp
any located in the Northwest corner of the United States (sigh).  We also provided funding for the world's first Internet browser, and set up Apple's first Internet web site.<BR><BR>
I spent most of my career as a UNIX user and, later, a Macintosh user.  I managed to avoid having to use Microsoft DOS or Windows prior to Windows 95, but for the past several years have had the, uh, "pleasure" of being a Windows 95/98 user.  I must confess that I have never been an Amiga user, but I was well aware of what was going on in the Amiga community as the Amiga and Video Toaster moved multimedia into the mainstream.  People at Apple had a great respect for the Amiga, and the communities always seemed similar to me.  I am rapidly learning more about the spirit of innovation that has been at the heart of the Amiga community since the first Amiga was shipped in the mid-80's.<BR><BR>
Well, it is now 1999, and we find ourselves at the dawn of a new millennium, and the dawn of the information age.  The personal computer, as represented by Windows PC's and Macintoshes, is now a mature product category, with little true innovation occurring in the PC industry.  What's next?  With the PC industry now in it's third decade, what will be the next big "S-curve" that will dominate the next 20 years of computing?  Clearly, it will involve the emerging global information infrastructure, which is creating a fundamental transformation of business, communications and, indeed, human culture.  In many ways, we are transitioning from the era of computing - building faster and faster computers that may, incidentally, be networked - to the era of communications, with powerful ubiquitous communications networks that connect a wide variety of computing devices.<BR><BR>
We at Amiga feel that unleashing the full power of this emerging information infrastructure requires much more than a PC with a browser plugged into the Internet.  What is needed is a complete home computing environment that ties together powerful multimedia convergence computers with easy-to-use information appliances, all transparently accessing content and services on the Internet.  As Jim has told you, our vision and mission is to make computers a natural part of everyday life by creating an industry-standard systems architecture and operating environment for this new world.  In essence, we want to redefine the home computing experience for the 21st Century, combining awesome multimedia, transparent networking and Internet access, and a user experience that makes a computer or information appliance as easy to use as... a toaster!<BR><BR>
It's a very exciting time as the spirit of the Amiga starts building again.  Personally, I'm thrilled to be a part of the new Amiga team, working with Jim, Petro, Jeff Schindler, Allan Havemose, and the other top people who are being attracted to this opportunity.  I look forward to sharing more about our vision, technologies and products in the months to come.  Stay tuned...<BR><BR>
