<B>Operations/Planning:</B><BR>
1) We are looking in San Diego to move out of the Gateway building into a separate Amiga building in order to accommodate the expansion in Amiga's San Diego staff.<BR><BR>

<B>New Staff:</B><BR>
1) We hired Dr. Rick LeFaivre as our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Sr. VP of advanced technology. Dr. LeFaivre is a senior technology executive who has worked for Apple, Silicon Graphics, Sun, and Inprise. See the associated Amiga website <A HREF="/diary/1999/990519b-e.html">news release</A> for more information.<BR>
2) We hired Tom Schmidt as our Chief Operating Officer (COO). Tom Schmidt is an experienced senior executive from Allied Signal, which is a $30 billion corporation.  See the associated Amiga website <A HREF="/diary/1999/990519c-e.html">news release</A> for more information.<BR>
3) Several weeks ago, we placed Amiga employment ads in major newspapers and have a significant amount of highly qualified leads that we are reviewing.<BR>
4) We have hired a full time recruiter to coordinate our expanded recruiting efforts.<BR><BR>

<B>Major Development Programs:</B><BR>
1) O/S 3.5 - This product is being developed by Haage & Partner under contract from Amiga. The target release date is late July or early August. We are talking to Amiga hardware development companies to qualify hardware products targeted at the O/S 3.5 release. We plan to come out with a recommended hardware configuration and list of qualified Amiga hardware products for the O/S 3.5 release.<BR>
2) AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment (OE) – We are developing our next generation operating environment including operating system, user interface, and some revolutionary software structures to be disclosed at a later date. Target beta version is 3Q99 with final in late 4Q99. We are also looking at the possibility of porting this new AmigaSoftTM OE to the O/S 3.5 recommended hardware configurations. If we can accomplish this it will allow people to run the new OE on specific Amiga configurations with PowerPC boards.<BR>
3) Next generation hardware architecture – Being developed as a foundation for all next generation Amiga products. We are within several weeks of final component selection.<BR>
4) AmigaSoftTM development system – This is planned in 3Q99 along with the beta release of the new AmigaSoftTM Operating Environment.<BR>
5) Initial next generation computer – We are developing the next generation computer that will be used to launch the next generation systems architecture and operating environment. Target release date is late 4Q99. Please see this week's letter to the community for more information.<BR>
6) We have released concept drawings of the next generation Amiga products to the Amiga press.<BR><BR>

<B>Shows and Community Activities:</B><BR>
1) I visited Germany and the U.K. and met with representatives of the Amiga community. We held meetings with leaders of the Amiga community and discussed future Amiga plans.<BR>
2) We will sponsor and participate in the 1999 London World of Amiga show in late July.<BR>
3) We are also planning to support the AmiWest show in late July.<BR>
4) We are planning for the Cologne and Las Vegas shows in November.<BR>
5) Petro and Jim Von Holle are developing reseller, distributor, and magazine support programs to help the Amiga community.<BR>
6) We are also working on some user group support programs and improved communication programs.</FONT>
