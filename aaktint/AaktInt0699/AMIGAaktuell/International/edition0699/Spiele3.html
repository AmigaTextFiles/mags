<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Welcome to a mini edition of the Amiga aktuell international games section. This is due to the few news on the one hand,
on the other hand that I'm quite busy in the moment. The trailblazing news of this month are the announced ports of
the monolith games Shogo and Rages of Mages. I have to admit, that Shogo was announced already last month and I overlooked it.
Thanks to Steffen Haeuser, who informed me about it! Those who didn't watch Shogo should do it as quick as possible, because
it is the graphical highlit, it is superior even to Quake 2. The Amiga version will only run on Amigas with a PowerPC processor.
There are Amiga personalities like Thomas and Hans-Joerg Frieden as well as Christian Sauer in port team. So we can hardly wait
for the result. In any case the announcement is reliable, because the people mentioned above wouldn't give their name for any
&quot;maybe it can be done in the future&quot; project.
</P>
<P>
But even there isn't a breakthrough in the game sector I have to mention, that someone can hear the name Amiga more often
during the last weeks. It is most likely, that this is due to the announcements of Gateway/Amiga, Inc. So e.g. THE
PC emulator site Zophars Domain (<A HREF="http://www.zophar.net" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.zophar.net</A>) also informs
about new emulators for Amiga. In addition there was an interesting report about the comeback of the Amiga, in which the
team writes, that they really hope the comeback to become true, because &quot;was one of the best computers&quot;. Tcha,
so someone can notice where the roots are ;-)
</P>
<P>
In our local tv station, Hessen-Fernsehen - HR, there was a report about computer games. In one scene they showed an
amusement arcade in Frankfurt near the Main, Germany. And there was an Amiga 1200 with Delugxe Galaga! The guy just playing
was asked, what he thought about &quot;violence in computer games&quot; and he ment, that this game (Deluxe Galaga) hasn't
been that realistic :-)
</P>
<P>
The report in the c't about the case of the Amiga program IDE-Fix the Amiga was (logically!) mentioned a few times.
</P>
<P>
So, then have fun with this edition,
