<H2>13. Show Report: Fun of Computing</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Fun of Computing in Ilmenau, Germany, May 29 and 30, 1999
</P>
<P>
It was the third fine event, which was happening for these two days. Congratulations. The first &quot;Fun of Computing&quot;
happened on May 31, 1997 in Ilmenau. Meanwhile the Fun of Computing evolved to a meeting point of computer fans in the
5 states in Germany's east. If graphics, music, Internet, DTP or just anything around multimedia - it is there. Seminars and
workshops enrich the Amiga world, which is the center of the show, with many themes. Petro of Amiga International, Inc.
was there to talk about news and future plans. In many personal talks, which Petro made, the fears and needs of the AMIGANS
could be discussed and dispelled. Saturday evening the discussion continued while having beer and the good Thuringian sausages.
</P>
<P>
Ilmenau is worth a trip, anyway. The nice university city in the Thuringian forest also inspired Goethe.
</P>
<P>
Next year there will be another &quot;Fun of Computing&quot;, so see you next year.......in Ilmenau, put it into your
time table, today....<A HREF="http://www.azt-ev.de" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.azt-ev.de</A>&laquo;
