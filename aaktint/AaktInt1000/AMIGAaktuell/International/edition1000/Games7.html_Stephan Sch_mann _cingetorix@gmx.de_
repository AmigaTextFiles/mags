<H2>6.2. PD-Tests (by Malte Mende)</H2>
<H3>SameGame</H3>
<P>
I would like to start with SameGame which impressed me really. At first I thought:
Another boaring WB game... but it is real fun.
</P>
<P>
On the screen you see a gameboard which is filled with colored balls.
</P>
<P>
You have to remove the balls by clicking on it. BUT: you can only remove a ball 
when there are at least 2 in same color side by side, vertikal or horizontal.
The more balls you remove with one click the more points you will get. 
</P>
<P>
Who removes all the balls (which is not easy!) will get 1000 extrapionts.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the game you can join the highscore list which allows a contest with 
friends or opponents.
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 65000 gameboards the game is a bit boring in the 
long run.
</P>
<P>
The graphic is simple but good. The game is played either on a screen on the 
workbench or on a custom screen. There is no sound.
</P>
<P>
Sum: For playing only sometimes quite good.
</P>

<H3>SpaceBall2000</H3>
<P>
Yeah! That압 freeware! This is one of these games which everybody should have.
</P>
<P>
You are a robot (or is it a human in armaments?) and playing a Pong like game 
against the computer or a friend.
</P>
<P>
Well, it is not really Pong, it is more a Shufflepuck-Cafe variant out of the bird압-
eye view.
</P>
<P>
You have to get a ball in the opponent goal which is nearly the whole upper 
border of the screen and have a look that the opponent does not get the ball into 
your goal.
You hit the ball under the law of: the angle of incidents is the angle of reflection.
Further more there are two moving girders on which the ball can rebound and 
sometimes a magnetic field changes the direction of the ball.
</P>
<P>
Seams to be complicated, but it is not.
</P>
<P>
When you have 5 goals you get further and play against the next opponent.
</P>
<P>
But if your opponent has 5 goals the game is over.
</P>
<P>
In addition to playing against the computer you can play against a friend (might be 
excellent on boring partys!) or in training modus against an impossible opponent.
</P>
<P>
The graphic is really good and attains its goal.
</P>
<P>
The FX are also good (I could sware I heard them elsewhere) and the music is nice 
and doesn앖 importunate. Nothing bombastic but good.
</P>
<P>
The game is making passionately desiring it...
</P>
<P>
Sum: You have to download it, you won앖 regrett.
</P>

Every Amiga user who likes to play might know Scorched Tanks. This is a light 
version for the workbench.
</P>
<P>
&#132;Light&#132; means less graphics, less weapons, less opponents.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the game can only be played on a 640*512 screen or higher, my 
eyes don앖 like it...
</P>
<P>
But a really Amiga freak has an eye friendly monitor, and don앖 think it is a 
negative point ;-)
</P>
<P>
The aim of the game is to shoot the opponents tank.
</P>
<P>
You fix the firing angle, strength and size of the munition. Better munition can be 
bought in a shop (also during the game). Further more you can move your tank 
(with petrol from the shop) and buy additional energy.
</P>
<P>
To make a good shot you have to take notice of the wind which changes every 
round, in strength and direction.
</P>
<P>
And so it is not as easy as it seams.
</P>
<P>
If the computer opponent is not smart ( or to smart) you can change the artificial 
intelligenz ( or imbecility), just as you want.
</P>
<P>
Further more you can decide how much bonus boxes should fall down, which color 
the background should have, the maximum of the getable energy, if there is wind 
and so on...
</P>
<P>
The graphic is quite simple, normal for a WB Game. There is not much sound, the 
best one can be heard by shooting out of the screen.
</P>
<P>
Sum: without regard to sound and graphic, it is a good alternative to Scorched 
Tanks, but the original is much better.
</P>
<P>
The one who wants real action should decide to get the commercial version Worms 
DC.
</P>

<P>
It압 possible to overdrive with the WB friendly games. This PacMan clone is build 
out of the graphic parts of the OS 2.1+. This view alone is it worth to download 
this game.
</P>
<P>
The princip of the game is well known. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ...very... interessting graphic is the funny too, some stolen samples are 
entertaining the ears. Better listen to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The Handling is simple, you can use the curser keys or a joystick via LowLevel.lib. 
Unfortunately the inquiry of the collisions in not exactly, sometimes it saves your 
life, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
In the long run this game is not funny.
</P>
<P>
An interessting feature: You can scale the game field freely. My commputer resets 
sometimes if I try this.
</P>
<P>
Sum: It is a good game for a play at times but boring in the long run.
</P>

Simple games are the best. That압 an old wisdom. Following this wisdom, Richard 
Fhager as created a real simple game.
You move a dot which is pursued by another 25 dots. All dots have the same 
speed. If two dots collide they explode.
</P>
<P>
If the Players dot is in this exlosion the game is over, every other dot in the 
explosion will explode too. To get the dots exploding you just have to manage 
your pursue the right way.
</P>
<P>
The points you get is depending on the number of dots in the explosion:
three times the number of dots exploding simultaneous and a point for every 
second your dot survives. Seams a bit complicated but you앏l get it quick.
</P>
<P>
For the better ones there is a special modus activated by pressing F1. Then you will 
pursued by more points.
</P>
<P>
The graphic is quite simple, the dots are really dots, an so is the background. But 
the computer has to do a lot in the special mode.
</P>
<P>
The music in the game is very, very hectic and doesn앖 help in difficult situations
</P>
<P>
The music of the title screen is good (the other one isn앖 bad but veined;-))
</P>
<P>
In the readme file is mentioned that the game is for 5 minutes of fun. That압 true, 
but it is always fun to chase the pixel allover the screen.
 </P>
<P>
Sum: Get it, it is real fun but in the long run it gets boring.
</P>

<H3>Lord of Alcandria 3</H3>
<P>
This game is the last one because it is an adventure and I have not enough time to 
play it. This is way I just introduce it without any rating.
</P>
<P>
Lord of Alcandria is a Point&amp;Click Adventure in the well known style like
Maniac Mansion, Loom or Monkey Island.
This is the story of the game:
</P>
<P>
You are Krilok Rainwood, who gets to the County of Lotharia by accident. This 
county ruled Lord Hellock. His brother Krislow ruled the next-door county 
Alcandria. Hellock wanted to possess both and in a battle for this he died.
Short after this the brother died, too.
</P>
<P>
The new Lord of Letharia is a bad man and is dominated by Hellok out of another 
dimension. Many children have been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
Before the first mouse click you can already see that the graphic and the sound is 
excellent. The qualitiy is like the one of Monkey Island3 or Simon the Sorcerer, 
thein-game graphic as well as the animation in the beginning
</P>
<P>
As mentioned above, I haven앖 played the game as much and so I do not want to 
tell any false.
</P>
<P>
No rating today.
