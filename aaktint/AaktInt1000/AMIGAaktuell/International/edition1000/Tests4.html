<H2>4. Experience report: CyberVisionPPC in a Winner-Tower (by Stefan Czinczoll)</H2>
<P>
Trying to build a CybervisionPPC into a Winner (Elbox)-Tower my worst dreams came true: the CybervisionPPC probably only properly fits into the original A3000 desktop. I purchased the board at KDH-Datentechnik and it came along with eight photocopied pages from the manual. Maybe this was the reason it was cheaper than Vesalia ;-) The provided driver disk bore a label saying Cybergrafix V3.0, Version 2.8 (2000). I was really surprised. As far as I know Cybergrafix V4 is the latest version, isn't it? I hope that there aren't two different versions of this important graphics system....
</P>
<P>
Luckily, I had already bought CGX V4 and I just had to copy the correct monitor driver from CD-ROM and adjust the settings in &quot;CGX-Mode&quot; and &quot;Screenmode&quot;.
</P>
<P>
There's more: I had to remove a part of the harddisk's bracket because otherwise the PPC graphics board wouldn't fit. A special feature of the CybervisionPPC is that you can put it into the processor board's slot in two different positions as there are two connector ledges.
</P>
<P>
Considering the small amount of units produced I'm willing to pay the price for this graphics board but then I expect that I won't have to use a saw or a pair of tongs to put it into the computer. I also expect to get the latest drivers. I'd like to know if Vesalia found a &quot;smooth&quot; way to put the board into the Winner-Tower.
