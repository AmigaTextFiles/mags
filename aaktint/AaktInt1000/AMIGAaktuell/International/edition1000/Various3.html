&raquo;11.9.2000 Innovative announces future plans
(Sorry for the full-length version, but compressing the content
is difficult. In future, our newsletter will be short as you known them)
</P>
<P>
Innovative, known as the developers of popular AMIGA®-titles such
as fxPAINT, fxSCAN, VHI Studio and Ultraconv today announced the
future plans of the enterprise.

</TABLE>
<P>
The price for V3.0 will be at 69.- DM/35 EURO/35 US$. An update from
V1.0/V2.0 will cost 59.- DM/30 EUROR/30 US$. We won't offer updates
from V1.0 SE (ScanQuix-special edition). fxSCAN 3.0 can already be
ordered from Innovative's online-shop (<A HREF="http://www.innovative-web.de/" TARGET="_top">http://www.innovative-web.de/</A>)
and will be delivered as soon as the final product becomes available.
A completly new fxSCAN-website will be online at the time the new
version is introduced.
</P>
<P><B>The present</B></P>
<P>
Innovative regards the AMIGA®-market as too small to further exist
only from revenues of this market. The enterprise doesn't see any
tendencies towards improvement, as key-enterprises have either left
the AMIGA®-market or went out of bussiness and important hardware-
products are only available as long as they are still in stock.
Faster, more up-to-date or completly new hardware doesn't seem to
be within reach and major improvements of the current Classic-AmigaOS®
are not to be expected in near future. The AMIGA® SDK is a highlight,
but it is not a garantor for the future existance and maintenance of
the new AMIGA®-Operating-/Computersystems.
</P>
<P>
The current situation forces Innovative to look for new markets and
to no more *exclusivly* work in the AMIGA®-market.
</P>
<P><B>The future</B></P>
<P>
After the availability of fxSCAN V3.0, Innovative will intensify work
on a new technology (details are not available due to reasons of
protecting Innovative's intellectual property). Programs developed with
the aid of this new technology (Codename &quot;InNT&quot;) will be more comfortable
to use and will have an even more spectacular optic. Furthermore programs
developed with it will be highly portable to other platforms and CPUs.
Indeed porting an application is expected to take only a few days, cutting
down both the amount of development-time and -money that has to be spent
for that task. As soon as the first version of this new technology is
finished we will start porting already known Innovative-titles to the new
technology and a variety of different platforms. Besides the AMIGA®-market,
the Windows®- and Linux®-market will be target of the developments of the
company. It's also planned to hand out licences for this new technology,
but this still has to be decided. The result of the decision will be
announced in a later, seperate press release.
</P>
<P><B>The AMIGA®-conversions</B></P>
<P>
We regret to say that our new technology will most probably not be able
to run on 68K-PPC-Dual-CPU-Systems as it is currently used in some AMIGA®s,
as a seperation of the GUI and the program will be hard to perform and a
68060 definatly seems to be too slow for fluid and comfortable work. Once
the development of the first version of the new technology is finished,
Innovative will evaluate the possibilities of a portation to MorphOS and
APUS Linux and is currently planning a portation to these platforms. The
Tao® Elate®-based new AmigaOS® will be supported by Innovative as far as
it is available. This way, AMIGA®-users will be able to continue enjoying
the high-quality and highly innovative software by Innovative.
</P>
<P><B>The current products</B></P>
<P>
It can't be denied that future plans are in conflict with the further
development of the current product-line for AMIGA®-computers. Nevertheless
the currently existing products will be developed further and updates will
be available at a regular basis though not as often as in the past. As soon
as the versions developed with the new technology are available, users get
an update-offer. So everybody buying an Innovative-product today, buys a
product that will be developed further in future and that he will be able
to use even after switching to other OSes like Windows®, Linux® or &quot;Amiga®
NG&quot;
as well.
</P>
<P><B>The webservices</B></P>
<P>
We will stop offering webservices, as the amount of time and money spent
can in no way be justified with the resulting revenues. Existing contracts
will continue to exist for a yet undefined time whereas we won't do any new
contracts. Of course we will continue to offer special solutions for
companies
in the future and we'll also keep updating the &quot;Amiga Link Directory&quot;.
