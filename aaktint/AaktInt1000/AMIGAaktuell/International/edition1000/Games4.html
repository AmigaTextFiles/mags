Epic Marketing found two new enterprises, Epic Interactive and Epic Multimedia. 
Epic Interactive will be responsable for the development of games and Epic
Multimedia for the distribution of products.
After the publication of Simon the Sorcerer 2, Dafel Bloodline and Earth 2140, the
Classic Amiga will only be supported in the future when these games are sold very, 
very good, otherwise there will be no longer support.
Epic Marketing Germany will be closed and so the support stops.
