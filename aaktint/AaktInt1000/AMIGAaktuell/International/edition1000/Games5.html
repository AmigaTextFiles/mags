<H2>5. Review: Aminet Games CD-ROM</H2>
<P>
Who does not know them, the good old Aminet CD-ROMs. 
They belong to every serious Amiga user just like a monitor or accellerator card 
(even if one has access to the Aminet directly!) Now Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe 
GmbH has published a compilation of the games on the Aminet on cd rom, which 
includes several commercial games also.
</P>
<P>
The Aminet Games CD-ROM looks like a normal Aminet CD but the content is really 
different, instead of the normally appearing directories there is only one directory  
&quot;game&quot; which includes as commonly known a variety of games.
and a directory &quot;Bonus&quot; which contains several commercial
games, 70 exactly, but most of them are not well known and have been only 
published on the Gamers Delight CD ROM. So only Gloom 3, X-Treme Racing and 
Max Rally might be interesting.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the Aminet Games CD-ROM contains a raiting of the game and 
further information. So every player can find his favourite games
All games but the commercial ones are in archives but it is possible to start them 
easy thanks to the inner system of the cd which does not work correct all the time.
</P>
<P>

There are 81 Megabytes of multiplayer-games, 61 megabytes of Actiongames, 41
megabytes of board-games, 169 megabytes demoversions of commercial games, 32 
megabytes of jump'n'runs, 145 megabytes of miscellaneous games of, 77 
megabytes of role, adventuregames,122 megabytes of shoot'em'ups, 120 
megabytes of mindgames and 16 megabytes of workbench games. The commercial 
games take about 70 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
Sum: The Aminet Games CD-ROM can be recommended to every player who woud 
like to get the best games out of the Aminet on one cd-rom. Who prefers to use 
the old cd-roms might do this as well, there is no ´exclusive´ game on the
Aminet Games CD-ROM; with the exception of the commercial games. They might 
be a good reason to buy this cd, X-Tream Racing, Gloom3 and Max Rally for DEM 
30 (Euro 15.29) 
And the rating which is arranged different than normal:
