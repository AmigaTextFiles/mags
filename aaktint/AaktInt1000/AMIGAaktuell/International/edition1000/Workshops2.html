<H2>2. Upgrading on the net: my dream A500... (by Dirk Wenk)</H2>
<P>
This is the year 3217. These are the adventures of the USS Ent... oops
... sorry, wrong channel ...
</P>
<P>
This is the year 1987. It is Christmas Day and I am over the moon
because I have been presented with an Amiga 500 :) Hooray!
</P>
<P>
Everything is super, impressive and fast. Fast forward to 1992/93 ...
The A500 has sprouted a second floppy, Kickstart 2.05 and its memory
has quadrupled to a massive 2 MB. The magazines are full of turbo
boards and harddisks and I start to dream...
</P>
<P>
Now it's the year 2000 ... Wow, what progress! ;) The A500 is retired
to a cupboard and on the desk or under it there is a towered A4000
with all extras, beside an A1200 working as a server.
</P>
<P>
I sit and think about the good old days. What was I up to 5 or 10
years ago? Off I go down to my magazine collection (I can't throw
anything away!). There in the dark are the boxes filled with old Amiga
magazines (cough, dust). Open the first treasure... 8/92. Hey, I
recall this edition like yesterday :). Is it really sooo long ago?
</P>
<P>
While browsing I find an article marked with red. It is a test report
on the &quot;Blizzard Turbo Memory Board&quot;, which housed a 14 MHz MC68000
and up to 8 MB memory plus a &quot;Shadow Memory&quot; for loading a kickstart
image. Yes, now I remember: that was the next thing I wanted for the
A500 in those days. A glance at the price, and I get a shock ;) no way
could I have afforded it at that time! ... but maybe now...
</P>
<P>
Jumped on the A4000 and took a look around the Internet. I plan to
awaken my A500 to a new life! I figure I could also fish around for
all those good old games and play them once more:). And lo, a Blizzard
is for sale, including 3 MB RAM! And the price? Just a fraction of the
old days! The 50 DM are transferred quickly and the board is in my
hands.
</P>
<P>
Open up the A500 and ... baaah, wait a minute, what is that? A
kickstart selector board is in the way! Hey, I had completely
forgotten that! What shall I do? Which ROM should I leave in? Kick 1.2
or Kick 2.05?? Mmmmh ... Kick 1.2 is the best for the old games, for
the rest I could use the Shadow Memory! But the Shadow Memory has to
be fitted first! What do I need? Aha, 4 ICs making 512 KB altogether.
Consulting my Conrad and Buerklin catalogues proves some prices still
shock.
</P>
<P>
But wasn't there something else with 512 KB? Yeah, the old 512 KB
memory extension prior to adding the 2 MB board! Where did I put that
old board??? After turning my room upside down, the board finally
appears. Now I have to tidy up (again!).
</P>
<P>
Quickly the 4 memory chips are levered out and inserted into the
Blizzard. All right, the first test run can begin! Power up! Running!
Huzza! :) Quickly load Kick 2.05, which I had read out before, into
the Shadow RAM with help of the supplied tool. Kick 2.05 is in and
runs marvellously! The speed is amazing! The board makes 1.48 Mips and
is faster than the standard A500 by a factor of 2.67. And fortunately
it can be switched off.
</P>
<P>
When surfing the Internet again something else occurs to me. Yes, I
need a 1 MB Chip RAM Agnus! Quickly a &quot;72a&quot; is gotten hold of and
because the 2 MB extension offers the option to address 512 KB as Chip
RAM, the Agnus is installed right away! A jumper is connected from the
Gary adapter board to the case and now I'm ready to change from 512 KB
to 1024 Chip RAM.
</P>
<P>
Settle down to play a few games ... :( Ouch, this is no fun with
Monkey Island 2, even with 4 floppy drives 11 diskettes are too many!
</P>
<P>
But wait! Aren't there harddisk controllers for the A500? Again onto
the web and search! Soon an internal board is discovered, an M-Tec
AT-500. Will it fit into the housing? What does it look like, anyway?
Down to the mag archive. Yes, a test report is found right away, but
no picture. Only the recommendation of the editors etc. A top device,
but no picture! Go on, must be an advertisement somewhere :(. Ah,
finally a picture :). The board is small and very thin, will it fit? I
dare to order the board, at 37 DM you cannot go wrong (board is used,
of course. In the past it was much more expensive!)
</P>
<P>
The board arrives really fast, but as usual I am extremely busy, so it
takes some time until the big tinkering starts ;).
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning. A perfect day for handicraft :) Get the A500 and open it up! Which is the right way to install the part? On top or below the Blizzard? I first try it on top of the Blizzard, because it looks better. And this unfortunately is a mistake! N
ot everything that looks well on first sight really works!
My first concern is that the Blizzard's 14 MHz clock is giving the
controller problems, but that doesn't seem to happen. Instead the
Blizzard's memory has stopped working! Aargh ...! Put that aside for
the moment, because there's another snag! With Kick 1.2 neither the 1
MB Chip RAM nor the harddisk works. And the installation of Kick 2.05
is not the answer, since then all the old games will not run. That
means, Kick 1.3 is needed.
</P>
<P>
Off to the Internet where I find a kickstart selector board with
ribbon cables! With help of ribbon cables the board ought to be far
enough away. Ordered on the spot - 18 DM including Kick 1.3 is a
bargain, isn't it! The next weekend is nearing and the A500 readied
for tinkering. Selector board in, with Kick 2.05 also on it. With all
the dangling cables, not an easy job; could be a problem with the
addresses. Ok, installed, the controller goes in first and on top the
Blizzard. POWER ON! Nay :(. Oh yeah, the power supply is howling
wierdly ... Luckily I still have a spare from the A1200! Connected and
off we go!
</P>
<P>
Guru! Heeyy? Guru? How? What? Where? Why??? Switched to Kick 2.05.
Guru again! S***, what causes this? Incompatible, a little voice is
saying deep in my mind. No, this must not be! Not now, when I have
gone so far! So everything removed and tested part by part. Aha, the
IDE controller makes this s***! Now the scales fall from my eyes! The
harddisk I'm using (2.5&quot;, 170 MB) came out of the A1200, and had SFS
file system, 020 version installed. Cannot work! Switch off the
harddisk. Aaah, it boots from the diskette! All right, format the
harddisk, install OFS and test again. RUNNING!!! Huzza :) This is to
our liking! Now I have 14-MHz power, harddisk and 1 MB Chip RAM with
everything completely switchable. This way I can play those super-old
games again. This I call 100% compatible!
</P>
<P>
Oh no! The sheet metal shield does not fit any more! Well, then leave
it out - but the keyboard won't go in either. This sandwich of boards
is too high, but only by a few millimeters! How do I save space? Oh
yes, remove the support socket and try again! Still no fit, several
capacitors are in the way! But I am a clever guy by now and know which
end of a soldering-iron to hold. Remove the caps and solder in flat!
S***, does not fit yet, because now the ribbon cable gets in the road!
To be correct, it is the plug inserted in the ROM socket. Hey, I don't
need that anyhow! ROM socket soldered out, ribbon cable socket
soldered in. Now it must fit! Really, the cover closes. Will the metal
screen fit as well? I try and it does! As a bonus it keeps the
sandwich snugly in place. The harddisk is fastened with doublesided
adhesive tape to the shield. Closed and screwed tight and WOW: All is
in and running!
</P>
<P>
Oh, still a miss! Yes, you're right, the LED of the harddisk! Get the
drill, make a hole. Glue in the LED and connect it with the IDE
controller. No light ...! Of course, wrong way around! All right, but
now I'm happy :) It took a few years before I was able to afford all
this and the set-up is not totally up-to-date, but it is mine!
</P>
<P>
New specs: Amiga 500 rev. 5 with &quot;Blizzard Turbo Memory Board&quot;
68000/14 MHz + 3 MB FastRAM + 512 KB Shadow-RAM, M-Tec AT-500
IDE-Controller with a 2.5&quot; 170 MB harddisk, a &quot;Fatter Agnus 72a&quot;,
switchable between 512 KB and 1024 KB, a kickstart selector board with
ribbon cable and fitted with Kick 1.3 and Kick 2.05, a slow-RAM memory
extension board, of course disconnectable by switch as well.
</P>
<P>
Now in fact only an internal flicker-fixer board is missing. and this
just might fit inside. But this will be the end! ;) The controller
offers well over 1.4 MN/s at the harddisk, which is quite sufficient.
With a better cache setting additional kilobytes should be possible.
There is only one fly in the ointment: the external &quot;Action Replay
MK3&quot; module uses the addresses from 400.0000 and up. The Blizzard's
memory uses the address range from 200.0000 to 4ff.ffff so you can
imagine what happens if you activate the Action Replay.
</P>
<P>
Guru-Guru-Guru! But luckily the memory on the Blizzard can be switched
off, which lets the module work :)
</P>
<P>
Happy Hacking! With this machine you easily reach 1000 keys/s with the
rc5 client.
</P>
<P>
I hope you found this little story amusing. If there is someone trying
to replicate this who can't work out how to proceed at some stage,
please give me a message ;) And if there is anybody out there who does
not believe me, I will gladly send a print-out of the SysInfo output =)
