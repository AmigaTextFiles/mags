<H2>1. Background Report: Age against the machine ... (by Dirk Wenk)</H2>
<P>
Or: When Time's winged chariot runs over your Soft- and Hardware...
</P>
<P>
Well, this is something they don't know about in the land of PeeCee:
An old computer and the problems that go with it, ranging from a
leaking clock battery to total standstill!
</P>
<P>
Luckily the Amiga has not quite reached the stage of total standstill.
However, the first signs of senile decay are appearing, regardless of
the power of your system! Again and again in fora and mailing lists
you will hear cries for help: e.g. the clock does not show the right
time anymore. Commonly, the battery has leaked, particularly on the
A4000. It's easy enough to get a replacement, but you had better have
a deft touch with a soldering iron. And no one wants to send their
computer for an expensive repair just because of the clock! ... or are
you that rich?
</P>
<P>
Also common are reports of breakdowns due to oxidation or loosening of
a component. Ok, a loosened component is easily fixed, but what do you
do with oxidation? Or the other way around, how do you know that the
reason is oxidation and not a faulty board or similar? What do you
conclude from graphic trash on the screen but no guru, or an
unexpected Enforcer alert? Followed by failed data transfer from the
graphics board?
</P>
<P>
To give an example that has happened to me: inexplicable graphic
faults and complete dropouts made me think my graphics board was
giving up the ghost. Luckily it was a false alarm! After I had gone
over the complete configuration of my machine, to see if any patch or
program or even a mis-setting of the graphics driver might be
responsible, there finally remained only one cause, a faulty graphics
board.
</P>
<P>
I bit the bullet and dismantled the board to send it in for a repair
(unfortunately the warranty had expired long since), when the contact
pins of my board (a Picasso 4) attracted my attention. They were not
silver coloured any more but grey-greenish. A bad sign, but a glimpse
of hope! After cleaning the contact surfaces with Contact Spray and
subsequent reinstallation of the board the system ran without any
flaws. I had just got lucky (unlike the board repairers)!
</P>
<P>
But how many other users have had something similar happen? And how
many graphics boards, SCSI controllers, or other extensions were
junked or sent for repair because some inexplicable bug had occurred?
I'd say quite a few!
</P>
<P>
If you're really unlucky, something in your computer really will
become defective. I speak from experience, no make that plural.
Computer just crashes, or displays an error message like &quot;Ramlib
Error&quot; or &quot;Freeing Memory Error&quot; etc. A test run with a memory
testprog confirmed the worst: one address on a memory chip was
defective. Luckily there are progs for the Amiga to lock out those
broken memory addresses to stop programs saving their valuable data at
that place.
</P>
<P>
But it ain't that simple: some RAM bugs appear only after some
operating time and when the chip has warmed up. So you know which
memory address is defective, but not in which chip or memory module!
This requires lots of testing!
</P>
<P>
You may think you can open the computer and check each module. You
won't find it that simple, because

</TABLE>
<P>
It was no problem to test the memory, but of course it behaved
perfectly. Only after several hours testing was there a result. And I
was not having a good day, because I found the replacement memory chip
had a buggy module as well. ARGGGGGGGGGH!
</P>
<P>
Ok, that has to be as bad as it gets, right? Oh no. There's always the
chance you'll lose the lot.... there can't be many users out there who
haven't done this one. You have valuable data on your harddisk, e.g.
self-coded programs, graphics, text document etc. and what happens?
Your Amiga crashes and takes with it the harddisk!
</P>
<P>
After reboot you are greeted with a lovely message like &quot;Disk
invalid&quot;, &quot;Checksum error&quot; or, even worse, &quot;Not a DOS disk&quot;! Mostly
this occurs when the last backup was made ages ago. Of course the
program to salve harddisks was on the dead harddisk. But even if you
have the salve program on a diskette it does not mean that you can get
the data back.
</P>
<P>
Luckily this situation is less frequent thanks to file systems like
AFS, PFS, SFS and others. But the danger remains!
</P>
<P>
But what, you politely request, has this to do with ageing computers?
Everyone know harddisks tend to die at the most inconvenient moment.
Dear reader, I only wanted to clarify the pains that a loss of data
might inflict! And data is not only stored on harddisks...
</P>
<P>
What about ... all your old 3.5&quot; DD diskettes? They don't crash quite
as spectacularly but can you rely on them? How long should they hold
their data? Mmmmh? Don't know? I'll tell you: approximately 10 years.
The fruit of experience, because there are Amiga diskettes older than
10 years all over the place, especially game diskettes. Diskette data
just vanishes after this time! More and more you hear on your fave
mailing list &quot;Need disk number 3 of game xyz, because disk is
defective!&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Confucius say: man who doesn't save favourite games every ten summers
on a safety disk wins empty disk with nice label.
</P>
<P>
Ok, you can download more and more of those old games legally from
sites on the Internet, but unfortunately most of them are cracked
versions. Your original disk deserves better, and you don't want to be
greeted by a crackers intro ... :(.
</P>
<P>
Well, at least you're safe with CD-ROMs I hear you say - data on a
CD-ROM theoretically doesn't disappear at all. Sad fool! Not all CDs
were created equal! Too much sunlight is said to be harmful for the
sensitive 12x rewriteable CDs.
</P>
<P>
But, you argue, the technology of the future will solve the problem.
I'm not so sure we aren't digging ourselves an even bigger hole.
</P>
<P>
Look at the trend towards handheld biological displays, which are
super lightweight, use minimum power, but their lifespan is approx. 5
years. Or the tendency to overclock computer processors as standard,
or are even design them for a short lifetime - well, why not, since
every 6 months the bar is raised again. Do processors, which are
running with at more than 1 GHz and are transmitting strongly in the
wireless range, make any sense? I don't think so ...
</P>
<P>
Overclocking will give way to the multi-processor system. Or better,
to a quantum computer! Or the positronic computer, which computes in
negative time ... but what if we set off a singularity?!? Well, where
does the Amiga fit in there, what the future offer us computer
geriatrics ;)
</P>
<P>
So I can only offer one last piece of advice: &quot;Don't hit too hard on
the keys of your keyboard, because the plastics softener is quietly
vaporizing every day, making the keys more brittle and easier to
break...&quot; ;).
