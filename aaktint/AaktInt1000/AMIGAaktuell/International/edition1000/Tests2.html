<H2>2. Software test: SMS-Client &raquo;TaskiSMS&laquo; (by Klaus Moddemann)</H2>
<P>
There are many services offering ways to send SMS from the Internet, but some have outages or take a while to load.
</P>
<P>
To get around this, there is TaskiSMS. The usage and the user interface are similar to that well-known email client YAM. Like many programs, it uses MUI 3.8 (Shareware) by Stefan Stuntz. Additionally, you need OpenURL3.0 (Public Domain) by Troels Walstedt Hansen and some MUI classes available from Aminet. And Internet access, of course.
</P>
<P>
TaskiSMS is freeware: you can use and distribute the program for free. The installation is easy as pie, just unpack the archive and copy the program anywhere you want. There is an additional archive available from Aminet, containing a German catalog and an MWB-Toolbar. It is smaller than the old one and looks better in my opinion.

</P>
<P>
But now let's get going: when you first start the program, the preferences window is automatically opened. Here you enter your name, your email address and maybe a signature file. Then you can configure how the message will be delivered, either through a proxy server or via an email server like GMX.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/TaskiConfig.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/TaskiConfig.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="38" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
With that, the configuration is complete and the main window opens. The toolbar in the upper part of the window is very like YAM's, so everybody should be able to use it, and the functions of the buttons are self-explanatory.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/TaskiMain.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/TaskiMain.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="49" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The button &quot;New&quot; opens an editor window, where you enter the recipient, his phone number and the message text.
</P>
<P>
It is important ot enter the number in the international notation, for example +49171xxxxxx for the German provider D1. If the recipient is in the phone book, you can take the number directly from there, of course.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/TaskiTel.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/TaskiTel.jpg" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Now enter the message itself in the input box below. In the lower right corner is a counter to show you how many characters there are left to use.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/TaskiEditor.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/TaskiEditor.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="62" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
You can choose whether to send the message immediately or to queue it up for later, depending on if you are already connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
When sending a message, you get a status window which shows in detail how the transfer is progressing and if it was successful.
</P>
<P>
The manual is available in German, English and Italian. It contains all information required to use the program.
</P>
<P>
I think this program is quite useful, since you can write SMS messages offline and you can send several of them for the price of a single call. Furthermore, you have more characters to use than with sponsored Internet services, which also often limit the number of messages you can send within a certain period of time.
