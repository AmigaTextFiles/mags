<H2>3. The fall of Commodore from my point of view - part 1 (by Rainer Benda)</H2>
<P>
Reader Ugo Paliotto points out that the first three parts of our now
finished series &quot;The fall of Commodore from my point of view&quot; have not been
published in AMIGA aktuell international yet. We're going to make good this
oversight this month and in the month coming up:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;OK, where should I begin.......
</P>
<P>
I worked for Commodore from 1989 until 30 September 1993 in Frankfurt
(under four managers: Peter Kaiser, Winfried Hoffmann, Helmut Jost and
Alwin Stumpf - P.K. and W.H. not for long). I have some fond memories of
the job, but I think that Commodore's demise might have been have been
averted if management had listened to the advice of the employees.
Nobody expects managers to have the technical knowledge to make decisions
on their own - the company employs technical specialists for that. But if
managers ignore the specialists they are heading for trouble. Every company
has its problems but at Commodore there were simply too many.
</P>
<P>
I don't remember where Peter Kaiser came from or what he's doing now. In an
IT magazine I recently saw a picture of him - if my memory is right then
he's now managing a company. He was at Commodore for about six months. I
don't remember if he didn't like his job or he was dismissed. Well, I
believed that he was fired when I saw him leave the building.
</P>
<P>
Winfried Hoffmann went to ASI-Computer after his dismissal and as far as I
remember he was one of the founders of this company. The headquarters of
ASI-Computer were (are?) in Frankfurt Niederrad a few metres away from the
Commodore building. He's now a manager at Fujitsu and he started some kind
of joint-venture with Siemens. When he left some people from Commodore
&quot;followed&quot; him.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Jost was employed at Commodore (once or twice!?) at the distribution
unit and went to Amstrad in the middle 80s. He returned as manager to
Commodore. He was accompanied by one of our technical directors (Roland
Bernschein). He &quot;introduced&quot; the Commodore Volksmodem VM2400 which at the
same time was the reason why he had to leave.
</P>
<P>
After his job at Commodore Helmut Jost (whose dream was to manage IBM) went
to Compaq. I don't know what he's doing now.
</P>
<P>
Alwin Stumpf was also in the Commodore team in the early 80s but went to
Atari and reappeared just in time for the &quot;unofficial&quot; transaction of
Commodore. After he had left C= in 1993/94 he went east with his
brother-in-law in order to develop some kind of PC multimedia hardware.

<P>
First of all: I do not agree with the common opinion that Commodore's fall
was caused by Commodore's PC series only or that Commodore had to file for
bankruptcy because of this series even if the press always presents it that
way.
</P>
<P>
Commodore's fall was based on the arrogance of the leading managers who
believed that Amigas could be sold without doing anything. You just had
wait and people would queue up impatiently to buy the whole stock-in-trade,
they thought. The Amiga wouldn't have changed this way of thinking even if
they had sold a hundred times more machines because there were too many
wrong decisions and the consequences were inescapable.
</P>
<P>
In the early and middle 80s Commodore had serviceable &quot;IBM compatible&quot;
computers which were used in many schools. Models such as the PC10/PC20
sold quite well around 1985 (until then there was no Amiga and the main
profit came from this series and the C64). Some returns also came from the
C128 but not as much as expected. Commodore had several big customers such
as the German railway stock corporation and this business was probably
profitable.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately some employees thought of their job as a &quot;normal&quot; job
(loyalty is OK, but blind obedience and trust in God to get all decisions
right is unhealthy). On the whole, the distribution employees thought that
everything would turn out right somehow. Commodore had survived worse
situations. Some didn't care at all because Commodore was just a
stepping-stone in their career.
</P>
<P>
Without exaggerating I can say that there was nobody who dared to risk his
neck but me in order to prevent or put off the evil day. In my opinion
Amiga users were never regarded as such, but as simple customers... buy our
box, bye bye.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions to this behavior were Peter Keshishian (at that time product
manager Amiga) who left the company in 1992 after he had found out that his
(and our) goals could not be achieved. Others included (even though he
didn't like those kind of &quot;fights&quot;) Doc Peter Kittel (leader documentation)
and Wilfried Haering (some may remember his name from several Amiga OS books
from Markt&amp;Technik) who was product manager for Amiga-Unix (more on this
later) and finally Imke Gisch (product manager for CDTV - many ideas, worked
hard but all in vain, I'd say).

In Frankfurt at Commodore (when I was a member of the team) 5-6 people were
responsible for the Amiga and the same number in Braunschweig. We ran the
dealer hotline, customer hotline, product management and service (greetings
to Axel Kraemer and Andreas Steep who are presently employed at Amiga
International, Braunschweig, before at Amiga Technologies :-) ).
</P>
<P>
[note from the translator: Axel Kraemer left Amiga International in November
1999.]
</P>
<P>
The Amiga (I'm talking about me) was always an emotional thing and more
than just a box that you did your work on. Thus it was even more painful
that nobody seemed to listen to ideas. You simply could not get it off your
mind even when you tried to concentrate on more &quot;important&quot; things. Memories
keep flooding back.
</P>
<P>
Commodore Germany (that was basically no more than a name for us employees)
had a special division called &quot;ESCO&quot; (European Support and Coordination
Office) for contacting Commodore USA in times of trouble. We would tell
hem our problems and if they understood (I'm not talking about the language
here) and the managers in the USA thought that they were serious then
something would be done (not enough, unfortunately, as far as I'm
concerned, but I don't blame the American colleagues - one of them today is
employed at Amiga Inc. and bears the name Dr. Allan Havemose although I
think that he's too conservative. Maybe he simply wasn't allowed to do more.
Before the end of Commodore he went back to the USA). We were able to
contact Commodore in the USA directly as well (Dave Haynie, Carolyn
Scheppner ...) but I didn't get this chance very often. ESCO supported the
German part of Commodore with additional information on new products (plans
of boards, beta software ...)
</P>
<P>
The hierarchy at Commodore worked this way: we had to report everything to
our technical director (at first there was one for the Amiga division and
one for the PC division) and he then passed everything to the managers -
filtered or not.
</P>
<P>
It was always difficult to get action on problems because, unfortunately,
the directors responsible were often changed (I experienced that four or
five times). Later there was one director for both the Amiga and the PC
division.
</P>
<P>
One of the technical directors wanted to close the Amiga division because
he saw no use in the Amiga. Shortly after he had said that he was moved
on... Then there was another who understood our problems but he couldn't
get a response from management and so we had to send in the same reports
again and again.
</P>
<P>
The last director thought that he was experienced enough to tell the
management in his own words what we had given him as written text. Of
course, something completely different came out. In addition, Commodore
hadn't really thought through our division properly. We were supposed to
help people with Amiga problems but (as the management said) we cost too
much money. We would have liked to offer further services or products but
we were not allowed to because we were not a distribution division.
Sometimes we were called &quot;technical support division&quot;, then simply &quot;Amiga
division&quot; and later on &quot;technical marketing&quot; and so on... (I often had the
feeling that creating calling card titles had highest priority).
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this meant that the product managers couldn't do what their
title said. There was nothing to manage and they were not allowed to
introduce products either (the management at that time did it with/without
consent of Commodore USA). As long as a manager made profit he could do
whatever he wanted. If there was no profit then he was dismissed (with a
money bonus, of course). Whoever made most profit was allowed to set the
company's direction. The managers of other branches (Austria, Italy, etc.)
basically had no right to decide anything. Some of them were probably
seething about that...
