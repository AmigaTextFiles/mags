<H1>Amiga aktuell international competition</H1>
<H2>1. Results of the last competition</H2>
<P>
I cannot believe it - just 15 readers participated at the last
competition? I sincerely hope this is only a momentary fall off, it would
not be for the first time, would it?
</P>
<P>
Please this time consider the participation. You know, you may win already
with two answers.

<P>
Several contributors commented on their answers:
</P>

<P>
Denis Zwornarz does not approve the use of an x86 processor: &raquo;I
don't see any essential advantage in the use of an x86 CPU (except in
winter time if the heating fails). I'd prefer a G3 or G4 in any case.
May be it is not the most favourable alternative, but to my opinion
the better solution.&laquo; </P>

<P>
In contrary Steffen Jahn is in favour of the x86: &raquo;The
development of a new processor or the use of one, that is produced
only in small amount is not good. A x86 CPU ought to be used, because
firstly this type is produced in huge numbers and secondly the
competition between AMD and Intel minimizes the prices. In my opinion
an additional reason is the wide spread of such processors and by this
to offer the possibility, that the standard PC user may use the
abilities of the AmigaOS. If the AmigaOS will run upon an x86 CPU,
this may lead to a radical change in the computer branch. All the
advantages of the AmigaOS ought to be usable with those processors,
and when this will happen, the Amiga will have a new future. But the
AmigaOS should run upon other processors as well, e.g. G4, to bring
the advantages of this (our) OS to all computer users of the
world.&laquo; </P>

<P>
Dirk Wenk thinks different: &raquo;The architecture of the x86 CPU
simply is to old-fashioned. The processor just is not good! The only
reason, why a CPU of this type still exists, is, that Windows runs on
it and it is really cheap by mass production, but nothing else.
Ideally the AmigaOS will run on a processor, that directly understands
the VP code. You might imagine a CPU like the one of Transmeta, which
instead of simulating an x86 architecture simulates a VP CPU! <BR>
 
[Would this really make sense? One of the big advantages of the new AmigaOS
is, that it contains the virtual processor and by this may be used on many
types of CPUs without loss of speed. Out of my view especially this technology
does not need a processor in the AmigaNG computer like the Crusoe of Transmeta,
which pursues a similar way -  but hardware based; Chief editor's note]
</P>

<P>
And for the step in between, as a transition, the VP ought to run on a
processor 1. permitting further development, 2. is fast and 3. is
small and has a minimum power consumption. Here I think of the
StrongARM or the PowerPC.
</P>

<P> But as well multi processor systems are quite attractive. Here you
don't need a fast highly clocked processor, that radiates like an xmas
tree in radio range, but many medium processors, which could work more
effectivly than a single one. You could imagine as well the
integration of phantom processors (see Amiga patent), that means the
washing machine helps comput etc. :-) But this will certainly take
another five years or more (unfortunately).&laquo; </P>

<P> Andreas Guldner does not think much of the x86 as well: &raquo;x86
heaters are close to the end of their possibilities, they cannot be
developed any further and are just clocked higher and higher without
caring a hang! All manufactures of chips certainly already work on
successors and out of this reason the multiprocessor-able RISC CPU is
the only good choice for an up to date system, the power of which is
added up out of the cooperation of all main, graphics and sound
processors available in the system. A software solution for users of
Windows as stimulus to buy a pure Amiga system certainly is sufficient
to convince x86 users to buy an Amiga after their PC has reached its
expiration date! Only an extremly small part of computer owners uses
those x86es, because she/he wants it and certainly many of them would
change their standard system against something better. Therefore a
prototype computer for a new OE should consist of modern and
upgradable components and not of oldfashioned PC technics, which will
reach its limits after one or two years. Why jump on a wagon, which
runs to the junkyard for scrapping??<BR>

[Please in future send your comments fore the question of opinions on
disk or via e-mail, thank you. Editor's note] </P>

<P> For Gernod Schomberg the CPU is of low priority: &raquo; I neither
am a computer technician nor am I especially experienced in questions
about informatics. Therefore I cannot judge, whether really only a
processor of the 68k series  of Motorola is appropriate to give the
intuitive feeling, that we like with our Amiga. I for myself don't
believe it! Apparently PPC and UAE users don't care as well! Not only
the feeling is important, I understand under &quot;Amiga&quot; as well
different things. E.g. the way of hardware extension maintained by
Amiga from the very beginning, which was reinvented ten years later by
another system as &quot;Plug'n Play&quot;; e.g. the possibility of
reading data of other systems; e.g. the datatypes introduced a few
years ago. And several more. Because the Next Generation Amiga will
anyhow be based upon a Virtual Processor the features we appraise
should be installed in the Amiga Foundation Layer/AFL und the
Amiverse. The processor/s of the hardware layer must only be fast
enough. I do not care a bit, what will be doing the work there.&laquo;
</P>

<P><B>Result:</B></P>

 <P> Clear thing - the big majority of the participants does not think
anything of an x86 processor in the AmigaONE. Obviously their desire
is answered: On the Internet website of the hardware producer
MeterNet, who will use the AmigaNG technology in his products, there
in a list of frequently placed questions it is said, that Amiga is
planning a desktop computer based on RISC - undoubtly they speak about
the AmigaONE -, what eliminates the use of an x86 as main processor.
