<H2>3. Foreword</H2>
<P><B>Hello, dear readers</B></P>
<P>
September has nearly passed and so it is time for a new edition of your favourite 
games section in the AMIGA aktuell intenational...!
This month there are not as much news although there has been some interesting 
novelty, e.x. the reorganization of Epic Marketing Germay. Read more in the games 
news from all over the world.

</P>
<P>
And now I have to correct something of the last edition. There has been an 
enormous mistake made by me. Fortunately it was without effect because only one 
reader mentioned it (thank you, Markus) 
To put it in a nutshell, in the last edition I reported that Crystal Software has 
stopped their whole Amiga productions but it is CS&amp;E who stopped it.
The release list is already rectified.
For my exculpation I can only say that is has been a very hot day when I wrote this 
hoax and the danger of mixing up is high, and so my brain was not able to differ 
from each other. Let us hope that such a mistake never will happen again.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately there is only one review this month, the Aminet Games CD-Rom. 
There were planned much more e.x. Codename Hell Squad, Joyride or Bubble 
Heroes. The first and second one we cannot present because Titan Computer does 
not give any test copies to online magazines and Digital Dreams Entertainment did 
not answer.
A test copy of Bubble Heroes should be on the way but has not arrived yet.
The prospect is good that it will arrive and  will then be presented next month.
</P>
<P>
Besides there is an extensive PD part because Malte &quot;Mac&quot; Mende has 
been hardworking. So read it, it will be worth it. This month I have updated the 
rubric &quot; Games, not heard about a long time &quot;

The rest of the games might be kicked out next month since there is only a little 
prospect that there will be happen anything.
</P>
<P>
Have a nice October
