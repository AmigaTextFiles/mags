<H1>Foreword (with review of the last month)</H1>
<P>
+++ MeterNet to use AmigaNG technology for internet devices +++ Petro
 Tyschtschenko establishes own enterprise +++
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell International. We apologize for
the delay in publishing this edition, but one of our translators, whom we
had taken into account for sure, has left us alone! 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately last month's news situation was not very interesting.
Additionally two members of the editors's staff fell ill - best wishes
to you, Christian and Ralf - and the number of software tests arriving
here was quite meagre. And this, even so recently the following regulation
was introduced:
</P>
<P>
The three most active AMIGA aktuell testers (including writers for
workshops) will beginning with the edition of January be taken in the
editors staff for halve a year. The criteria for this are number and
extent of the articles and their quality. All contributions published
in the editions from October through December will be rated.
</P>
<P>
This is thought as a (justified) reward for those, who strongly contribute
to AMIGA aktuell, but do not wish to take over the complete care for a full
rubric.
</P>
<P>
But as well at some other points the interest and attendance could be
higher:
</P>
<P>
In edition 06/2000 AMIGA aktuell performed a survey, which resulted
in the request of our subscribers to be able to read more interviews and
comments. Out of this reason we were looking for committed Amiga users
being ready to make interviews with well known people of the Amiga world
and/or to write an interesting commentary about some up-to-date topic
to reinforce our editorial team.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this we again aim at publishing in the future multipart
stories concerning the Amiga, after Rainer Benda's serial &raquo;The Fall of
Commodore out of my Sight&laquo; came to an end in the last edition. Who
has corresponding materials or is willing and in the position to contribute
an interesting serial?
Further more Numen Stahl retired from our staff out of personal reasons,
Therefore we are looking for a successor to cover his internet rubrics
(Presentation of Amiga Websites and Internet Tariff Rates).
</P>
<P>
If you care for a cooperation in our editorial staff or as an associate
contributor of AMIGA aktuell (you gladly may take some area of
responsibility to your liking, e.g. as tester for software), please mail
to <A HREF="mailto:aakt@aakt.de">aakt@aakt.de.</A> Thank you!
</P>
<P><B>Concerning the regular appeals:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> Here a request: Every author of an article rejoices, when receiving
  some acknowledgment, but as well about helpful critics, and he feels
  encouraged. Therefore please don't hesitate to articulate your opinion
  about the various contributions, either writing directly to the author
  or to AMIGA aktuell (<A HREF="mailto:aakt@aakt.de">aakt@aakt.de</A>).  
</LI>
<BR><LI> We permanently are looking for staff members, who regularly,
  sporadically or just for once will contribute to AMIGA aktuell.
  Concerning the topic there nearly are no limits. If you are interested
  please come forward to <A HREF="mailto:aakt@aakt.de">aakt@aakt.de</A>.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Does someone know, if the mailbox Empire in Essen, Germany,
  still exists?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Have fun with this edition,
</P>
<P>
Yours
