<P>May he or may he not?

<P>
As it became public in Mid-September AMIGA Vice-President Petro
Tyschtschenko together with a partner founded an own company. Not
extraordinary for a manager, you might say, but nevertheless out of
several reasons this message made headlines in the Amiga community.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons is, that apparently Petro Tyschtschenko did not
arrange this matter with AMIGA President Bill McEwen. - &quot;Must he?&quot;
several among you will ask. Most probably he must! Even in the contracts
of employment of the so called &quot;little people&quot; there often
clauses are contained, that the employee has to report the start of
an additional job to the employer, and in the contracts of managers
this formula will certainly be a standard - out of good reason: To grant
the success of an enterprise it is indispensable, that the top managers
are absolutely loyal to it, their full efforts have to serve only this
goal. The promotion of an own company encloses a danger, which must not be
underestimated - the conflict of interests, especially if both enterprises
operate in the same line of business.
</P>
<P>
But there are some more questions: Did Petro Tyschtschenko try to keep
this action in secret? There is the indication, because after becoming
public he at first tried to calm down: He only is a place-holder, he is
not concerned with all the business. But this is definitely refuted with
the published excerpt out of the trade register: Petro Tyschtschenko is
manager with the right of sole representation, what means, that he may
pass decisions concernig the dayly business without consens of his partner.
</P>
<P>
And did the AMIGA Vice President really use his trip to India, which was
financed by AMIGA, to install contacts in consideration of the foundation
of his company, which according to the words of Bill McEwen cannot fully be
excluded? Presumably we never will know!
</P>
<P>
All this finally leads to this question: Which is the future of Petro
Tyschtschenko with AMIGA? Will he stay in the company for a foreseeable
period or will he leave it out of his own or by some pressure of the
American AMIGA management? We may be eager to know, whether, and if yes
how, the whole situation will develop. I believe it as quite noteworthy,
that already now, two weeks after becoming known such an explosive affair
has disappeared out of the headlines. Right now there (at least in the
public) is silence - but may it be the calm before a hurricane?
