<P>
&raquo;So the world may know!

<P>
Taifun is in Development for the new Amiverse, AmigaOne and all Amigable Computers
</P>
<P>
Horb/Nordhornm September 1, 2000 - WK Artworks and KDH Datentechnik
announced today that they have launched the development of Taifun for the
new Amiverse, AmigaOne and all Amigable Computers. Taifun is the successor
product to the award-winning video and animation special effects software
Wildfire 7\PPC. The new software product is currently being developed
using the Amiga Software Development Kit (SDK) and is making great
progress.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Kuessner of WK-Artworks and Guenter Horbach of KDH-Datentechnik are
enthusiastic about the possibilities that the new Amiga OS offers to
applications running on the AmigaOne and other Amigable computers and
devices.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Taifun is a fantastic example of the innovative spirit inherent in the
Amiga community. We are proud to support Taifun, Andreas and Gunter. Once
again, we will see the power of an incomparable Operating System hosting
applications that are second to none,&quot; said Randy Hughes, Vice President
Sales and Strategic Alliances at Amiga Inc.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We are confident that Taifun will develop into a 'killer app' for the new
AmigaOne. We're investing into the Amiga future and feel certain that many
other companies will pick up on the development or the conversion of Amiga
Classic applications. For this purpose, we highly recommend the Amiga
Software Developer Kit in conjunction with the Amiga Inc. Support feature,
to all developers.&quot; said Andreas Kuessner at WK Artworks.
</P>
<P>
The Taifun release date will be scheduled to coincide with the date of
general availability of Amiga Inc.'s new AmigaOne computer. More screen
shots of effects included in Taifun's alpha version are available on the
WK-Artworks Web site. Taifun Light will be released first, its selling
price being set at approx. DM 199.00, EUR 100.00 or USD 99.00. A
professional version will follow; its price, as yet, unannounced. Updates
will be available from Taifun Light to the professional version. Exclusive
worldwide distribution for Taifun will lie in the hands of KDH
Datentechnik. For more information on Taifun, visit www.wk-artworks.de or
