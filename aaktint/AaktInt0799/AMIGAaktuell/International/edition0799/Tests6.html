<LI> Introduction
<P>
 Editors are important and often used tools for the daily work at and with the computer. In the beginnings computer
 were just better typewriters with small screens and fonts, that could barely recognized. But even today editors
 haven't lost anything of their importance. There's no software without programs, which have busily typed in.
 Meanwhile the editors support the work of the programmers with many functions and often offer a gigantic choice.
</P>
<P>
 pEditor is one of the simplier editors and offers just enough functions to edit easy texts or scripts. The author Esteve
 Boix hasn't wanted to offer more. pEditor is a MUI based editor. It shows the early phase of a text editor class for MUI.
</P>
</LI>
<BR><LI> Program requirements
<P>
 pEditor is satisfied quite easily. An Amiga with OS 3.x and installed MUI 3.8 are enough. Because MUI offers a bad performance
 on slow computers, fast processors are still a good choice.
</P>
<P>
 The program can be installed quickly. Just unarchive into any directory and start. There are no further files required.
</P>
</LI>
<BR><LI> Useage
<P>
 pEditor can be started from the Workbench or from the Shell. The editor can be controlled via menus and a tool bar, which
 offers the most important functions. Unfortunately some icons are not very intuitive. But they can be easily adjusted to
 the personal needs. They are present as IFF files.
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much to set up: Fonts, colours, tabs, the cursor control and motion, automatic line feed. A char, that is shown
 at the end of the line and a blinking cursor, if wanted, can be defined.
</P>
<P>
 The texts can be entered quickly. But if you set up a blinking cursor the input noticeable slows down. A nice feature,
 thanks to MUI, are the colours for background and foreground, that can be adjusted. In the end pEditor is like any other
 editor. You can search and replace words and a simple macro editor is there, too.
</P>
<P>
 Even a 5 MB text file is scrolled quickly. But the complete file is kept in memory, wo the hardcore test (46 MB) failed.
 In addition the size hasn't been checked so pEditor hangs up and doesn't react on inputs.
</P>
</LI>
<BR><LI> Conclusion
<P>
 During the test phase pEditor was reliable and didn't have any problems apart from the file size bug. A simple, small editor.
 And it is quite nice, thanks to MUI - what lies, of course, in the eyes of the beholder. In principle ed would do. But who
 wants nice programs is served fine with pEditor. It is no good choice for programmers, because you cannot bind in own
 functions.
</P>
<P>
 Because it is most likely, that pEditor isn't under further development and can be used as MUI class with more functions
 in programs, we might find it in different places. Due to the fact that the program is freeware taking a look doesn't
 cost anything.
