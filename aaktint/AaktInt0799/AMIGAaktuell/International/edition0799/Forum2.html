<P>
Under the headline &quot;nicht totzukriegen&quot; (&quot;not to get dead&quot;) they report about the announcement of AMIGA
to present a new product family including a handheld Internet computer and an A500 successor.
</P>
<P>
They also report, that the Amiga 1000 was the first 32-bit computer in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In addition there is a small picture of the Boing ball (but named as &quot;boink&quot; ;-)) and the Amiga logo (cut out from
an AI poster. They also mentioned the Internet addresses of AMIGA.
</P>
<P>
In the Past the Amiga was mentioned a few times. In the readers corner some editors &quot;outed&quot; themselves as (former)
Amiga users and in a test of the Team17 games X2 the pole position of the Amiga in sound and graphics in the beginnings of
the 90s was mentioned in a review of the predecessor Project-X.
</P>
<P>
In the emulators corner of the XL (which was under charge of J. Eggebrecht from Factor 5) our lady appeared sometimes.
