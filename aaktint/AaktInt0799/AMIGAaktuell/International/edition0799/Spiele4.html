<UL>
<LI> Wasted Dreams released
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There was no game that was worried about that much as Wasted Dreams, which was previously named Distant Dreams.
If you remember all the problems with this game: The original developer team went into bankrupcy and was bought
from another developer team, names were continously changed, Vulcan Software rejects the project and sells the
rights to the developer team... Many thought, that it wouldn't be published at all. Now, it is reality! Wasted Dreams
requires an Amiga with AGA or graphics board and 3 MB or FAM as well as a CD-ROM. You can read a review in the next
AMIGA aktuell international, because I haven't got my copy, yet.

<LI> Hyperion Software Update
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Steffen Haeuser informed me again extensive regarding the theme Shogo &amp; Co. and I don't want to keep them away from you:
Hyperion not just got a licence for the game Shogo, but a licence for the LithTech engine. This is a common 3D engine, which
allow realisation of games of any sort. The programming of the game is becoming unimportant, if this engine has been ported,
it is possible to also other games, which base on this engine without big problems. If there are ediquate sales, more games
of Hyperion Software, based on the LithTech engine, like the 3D shooter Blood 2, could follow.

<LI> Crystal Software and Electronics stay with Amiga
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Crystal Software and Electronics want to contine publishing games for the Amiga. There was especially an interest in the
NG-Amiga, said the Managing Director David Conolly. But they don't want to develop games for the Amiga, but to distribute
or to publish them. Connolly makes clear, that only high-quality games will be published. If you are interested, you can
contact David Connolly via &lt;<A HREF="mailto:david@pc-software.com">david@pc-software.com</A>&gt;.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
For their game Maim &amp; Mangle The World Foundry is looking for graphics designers. The requirements for the graphic designer
are quite high, so he has to be able to use Lightwave, experience in the 3D range and he hast to read The World Foundry
Game Encyclopaedia. I hope, I didn't shock you. If you are interested contact <A HREF="mailto:rob@worldfoundry.com!">rob@worldfoundry.com</A>!

<UL>
<LI> Joyride
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
X-Treme Racing fans can look forward: With Joyride a game in the style of Silltuna's classic is under development.
The team consists of a small group of developers, who work for a year on Joyride and hope, that it will be ready within
2 months. In the final version there will be three different car types and at least 10 different courses. The game
requires at least an 030 Amiga with 8 MB Fast RAM and, of course, a CD-ROM. A publisher for Joyrid isn't present, yet.

<LI> News from the Los Angeles Entertainment Electronic Expo
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Rick Jones, an Amiga journalist wrote in some newsgroups from his visit on the Los Angeles Entertainment Electronic Expo,
on which he asked some well-known games companies about their meaning about the Amiga NG. But he didn't ask some &quot;unimportant
persons&quot;, but persons with titles as President, Vice President, Manager and Director, so they are no unimportant
persons. Companies like Psygnosis, Blue Byte and Microprose know the NG Amigas, but want to develop for them, if there are
enough computers sold and there is a potential market. Rick Jones made clear, that many companies didn't know, there was
a new Amiga under development. This leads into the question, why Amiga, Inc. doesn't inform the companies. So we can only
hope, that Amiga, Inc. is going to make this up for winning them over.

<LI> Minimum Safe Distance by Satanic Dreams
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
What is the result, if you cross Worms, Cannon Fodder and King Arthur's World? Satanic Dreams knows the answer: The result
is the game Minimum Safe Distance, which offers according to the developers massive explosions, much blood (?) and more than
40 different weapons. In addition it is going to run with 50 fps on a standard 020 Amiga. But it requires AGA and 4 MB Fast RAM,
as well as a CD-ROM drive.

<P>
A still unnamed game, based on a movie, is to be published by Digital Images. According to Stuart Walker it is going to be
a spectacle full of action. The game is supposed to combine action and strategy and includes an isometric 3D game engine
