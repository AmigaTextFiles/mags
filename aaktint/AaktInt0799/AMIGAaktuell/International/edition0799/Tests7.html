<H2>7. Introduction: Music-CD 'uNDEFINABLE TUNEs Vol. 1' (by Thorsten Schoelzel)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Another new music-CD, that includes songs, that were composed entirely on the Amiga, pushes on the Amiga market;
I'm talking about the &quot;uNDEFINABLE TUNEs&quot;. This CD proves, that the Amiga is becoming an alternative to other
platforms especially in the sound sector. In the old ages the graphics qualities was admired, but this time seems to be
over, because: Amiga danced the house.

<P>
But whome do we have to thank for this music CD?
</P>
<P>
We can thank Deltaray alias Andre Lorbach.
</P>
<P>
He is 20 years old and wants to give us a kick on the backside, what is most likely to become a success with this CD.
</P>
<P>
In the age of 10 he programmed for the first time (manually) the sound of Ghostbusters, on an TI99/4A. With 12 years
Andre got an A500, he played on for 1 year until he began to test the first programs.
</P>
<P>
So he found on some disk a sound tracker called &quot;SIDMON 2&quot;. On this tracker his first mods, that were created
unfortunately deleted by him on accident.
</P>
<P>
Then he sold his Amiga in the age of 14 and one year later he bought an CD32, he extended to a complete A1200 with a
SX-32-extension.
</P>
<P>
On a PD-CD he found a freeware version of OctaMED v2.1, so he started again to create mods. Later he swapped to OctaMED
v4.1, after that he bought the disk version of OctaMED v6. Happily he made his music and began tests with an 8 bit sampler,
he e.g. recorded some rifs of his guitar he used in some mods later.
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. He could use four channels only, which was a hard limitation for him. He became happier when
OctaMED Soundstudio was published on the AMINET SET 5. This allowed to use 64 channels on a normal Amiga. With 17 years
he burnt his first selfmade Audio-CD called &quot;Deltamixes Vol.1&quot;, afer that he made one mod after the other so after
4 months he had the &quot;Deltamixes Vol.2&quot;, that included multichannels only.
</P>
<P>
Then he got a real A1200, which he extended with a 030-board.
</P>
<P>
Someday he decided to make his new mods on it. By the way: The Deltamixes Vol. 2 had mostly heavy-metal tunes on it, while
his style changed ti Techno-heavy hardcore with his next CD &quot;tERRORLORe&quot;. The &quot;tERRORLORe&quot; came one year
later, when he was approx. 18-19 years old. This CD has been of much better quality.
</P>
<P>
After that he stayed with OctaMED Soundstudio and made more mods, approx. 1 1/2 years he needed to make the &quot;uNDEFINABLE TUNEs&quot;,
which has been much better than the &quot;tERRORLORe&quot;. With the &quot;uNDEFINABLE TUNEs&quot; he tested some new things,
he also included TB303-bass lines into some songs, he made with the TB303 tracker v0.12. He also experimented a lot with
voices.
</P>
<P>
What's going on?
</P>
<P>
uNDEFINABLE TUNEs presentes in a nice CD-Jewel case. The cover shows impressive what avaits the listener. Also the backside
is fine.
</P>
<P>
On the CD you find 15 songs, most of them are Techno, Trance music is more seldom. Some tracks partly include voice samples
in a really clear and fine quality. The CD can be recommended to anyone, who likes this music. At last there is music, that
can be heard, which can be liked by the friends and collegues. The interesting part is, that these songs were created on the
Amiga. Big eyes are certain! For those, who wants to listen a bit to this music can download them, as they are on the CD,
from the homepage of Andre Lorbach. But the music lasts for 30 secs. each.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;uNDEFINABLE TUNEs&quot; can be ordered from Andre Lorbach for 15.00 DEM (approx. 7.65 Euros).

<P>
Future?
</P>
<P>
He has started to create a new CD, which still has no name! Not all of his mods he burns on CDs, approx. 5 of his mods
he declared for &quot;dead&quot; and approx. 25 mods are still in work.
</P>
<P>
There are other projects he made like e.g. a teacher-pi** *ff-song for the high-school diploma party. ;-)))
