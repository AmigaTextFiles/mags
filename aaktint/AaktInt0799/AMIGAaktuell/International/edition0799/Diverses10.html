<H2>10. DiscreetFX Hosts Software Porting Seminar at Amiga99</H2>
<P>
</P>
<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</P>
<P>NEWS SOURCE: DiscreetFX</P>
<P>NEWS HEADING: Special Event at the Amiga99 show</P>
(<A HREF="http://www.cucug.org/cucug-bin/cucug-ad-gac.pl">http://www.amiga-stl.com/show.html</A>). Bill Panagouleas of DiscreetFX
trains Amiga developers how to enter the lucrative market of porting
popular Windows, SGI & Mac applications to the Amiga.
<P>The Amiga has some very powerful software available for it at very
affordable prices. Feature rich applications like ImageFX, Wildfire,
Video Toaster/Flyer, Pagestream 4.0, Photogenics NG,  Fantastic Dreams,
AmiIRC etc. help define what an Amiga is and provide modern software for
Amiga customers. The Amiga does not have the wide breath of software
applications available on other platforms though. This is a double edged
sword, on one hand the Amiga gets the benefit of avoiding bloated over
hyped but bug ridden and under powered software. But on the other hand
many popular and mainstream applications that customers demand when they
buy their computer are not available for the Amiga. Products like Quicken,
Quickbooks Pro, ACT, Dragon Naturally Speaking, and most educational
software titles don't make it to the Amiga. Also many of the high-end SGI
applications which are well suited for the PowerPC Amiga & NG Amiga are
not available for it. Unknown to the Amiga community is the fact that many
successful developers for other platforms are on the lookout for new
operating systems and computers to port there well know applications to.
They lack the knowledge and Amiga background to port their software but
are willing to subcontract Amiga developers to do it for them. With other
top selling operating systems now becoming very controversial and falling
out of favor now is the time to approach these developers.
<P> Bill Panagouleas brings his past experience at negotiating deals and
managing these types of porting projects to the Amiga Development
Community to help them. Learn how to stop being a starving Amiga developer
and instead become a wealthy one by bringing popular best selling programs
to your favorite machine. Also you will be helping the Amiga become more
widespread and popular by making the software many know and love available
for Amiga. The aMozillaX project "http://www.amozilla.force9.co.uk/"
(Netscape Communicator for Amiga ) has already shown how just getting one
popular application ported can raise the bar on Amiga converge in the
mainstream press.  Everyone knows that popular software drives hardware
sales. Don't miss out on this very special event if you are attending the
Amiga 99 show and happy porting. Please see
