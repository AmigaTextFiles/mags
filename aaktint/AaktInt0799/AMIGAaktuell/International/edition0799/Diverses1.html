<H2>1. aMozillaX to be released to the World of Amiga show</H2>
<P>
</P>
[free amiga organisation]<BR>
</P><P><BR>
For Immediate Release:<BR>
</P><P><BR>
aMozillaX Press Release<BR>
</P><P><BR>
This statement is made by Ben Rothwell on behalf of the entire<BR>
aMozillaX team.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
When, in January 1999, we had the chance to begin work porting the<BR>
Mozilla source code to the 68k and PPC Amiga platforms, the press<BR>
coverage was significant and the community anxious to see a browser<BR>
with significant parts of the Netscape source code in it.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
However, recently it has come to light that there is a growing stem<BR>
of discontentment amongst users of the Amiga, due to the fact that<BR>
they still do not yet have aMozillaX.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
We would like to take this chance to make a formal apology to the<BR>
community for this situation. Initially we aimed for a release in June,<BR>
and at one stage it looked possible to make an early release in<BR>
early May. However, developing a program of this size and complexity is<BR>
not an easy task, and sometimes problems with the code or other problems<BR>
make the time slip back and the community ever more impatient.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
We can assure you however that we are working hard to ensure that we<BR>
will be able to release Version 1.0 of aMozillaX at the World of Amiga<BR>
show in London, mid July. Certain features will be missing, such as Java<BR>
mainly due to problems and delays in third party JVM solutions.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
However, we are confident that aMozillaX will be able to outperform all of<BR>
the current Amiga browsers upon release, offering speed and flexibility,<BR>
as well as power. ECMAScript, Dynamic HTML, DOM1, HTML4.0 will all be fully<BR>
supported in this release.<BR>
</P><P><BR>
We are also working to ensure that when we release binaries and source code,<BR>
the right structure is in place to enable other developers to work with us on<BR>
improving aMozillaX, more information about this improved web presence can be<BR>
found at www.freeamiga.org.<BR>
