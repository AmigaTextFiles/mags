<FONT SIZE=5>Director of User Experience R&D</FONT><BR><BR>
Dr. Jim Miller, Director of User Experience R&D, has worked in the 
 field of human-computer interaction for over 17 years. He has 
 specialized in the development of interactive systems that provide 
 exceptional creative power to their users, while maintaining 
 exceptional ease of use. Prior to joining Amiga, Jim was doing
 consulting on the design and evaluation of the user interface
 components of desktop software and  Internet products, and was
 involved in startup activities in the area of consumer Internet technology.<BR><BR>
 
 Previously, Jim was the program manager for Intelligent Systems at 
 Apple's Advanced Technology Group, where he led a number of research 
 projects on human-computer interaction and intelligent interfaces, 
 especially those involving agents and assistants, speech, and natural 
 language processing. Here, as elsewhere, much of his work was focused 
 in supporting technology transfer between research and product 
 development teams. The result of one such collaboration, Apple Data 
 Detectors, is available at  <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors" TARGET="_top">http://www.apple.com/applescript/data_detectors</A>.
 Some of his other interests include the ongoing convergence of computation
 and  consumer technologies, the creation of distributed networked communities,
 and  the evaluation methods for interactive systems.<BR><BR>
 
 Prior to joining Apple, Dr. Miller was the manager of the Human-Computer 
 Interaction Department in Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, and a project 
 leader in human-computer interaction at MCC (Microelectronics and 
 Computer Technology Corporation). Jim has a Ph.D. and an M.S. in 
 Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.S. 
 in Social Science-Computer Science from Michigan State University.<BR><BR>
 
 Jim is also active in SIGCHI, the ACM's special interest group for 
 human-computer interaction. He was co-chair of the 1992 CHI 
 conference, and was elected chair of SIGCHI in 1993. Currently, he 
 sits on the SIGCHI Executive Committee as Past Chair, and is also a 
 member of the organization's Conference Management Committee.<BR><BR><BR>
