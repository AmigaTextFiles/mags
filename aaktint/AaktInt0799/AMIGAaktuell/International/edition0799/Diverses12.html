<P>
Eight months ago we were chosen by Amiga as their foundation
OS partner. Our development group was thrilled to be part of
the rebirth of such an innovative product. To meet the
challenge we knew it would take a tremendous effort on our
part. We had a team of people in place working on our
part of the Amiga NG soon after the alliance was announced.
Over the next few months we involved more and more of our
engineering resouces towards making QNX an advanced
multi-media platform. Our investment so far has been
significant. These are costs we have born ourselves.<P>
It is clear today from Jim's letter that we were not chosen
for the next generation Amiga. Naturally we're disappointed.
So, where do we stand now? It is not our intent to confuse
the Amiga community. We are proud of what we have
accomplished and want to include Amigans in what we've
achieved. I did make a promise to deliver an operating
system and I intend on keeping that promise. I don't want to
split the community, nor do I wish to engage in a war of
words. I don't ask you to "trust" me or to take me at my
word. Both QNX and Amiga have promised to deliver technology
into your hands in the very near future. I ask only that
your assessment of QNX be based on what we do and what we
deliver. <P>
Thanks for the overwhelming support we have received so far.<P>
