<H2>5. Introduction: Music-CD from Byteaccess (by Oliver Schmidt)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;From Byteaccess - made with: Taxim, Cyborg Jones and Dr. Dischrage - there is a new music compo. The special is, that
all the titles were made with Amiga, C64 and Atari computers. The type of the music is synthesizer music and can good listened to.
Until now there are 8 tiles in form of a beta version.
</P>
<P>
The complete version is expected to be ready in November and will be available then. The beta version is available on tape
and on CDR. The version I have got is the CDR version. Due to the few titles the CDR is only 40% full and is about 30 minutes.
For the final version I recommend the Byteaccessers to use silver or golden CDRs, because the don't make that many problems
with older CD-players as the blue ones do. In addition the final version should have a cover or a Jewel for the CD, because my
beta CD was delivered in a CD envelope, which cannot be used well as a cover.
</P>
<P>
The tape and the CD can be purchased from Tim Lenke, Vor der Stauriede 7, 30826 Garbsen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The tape costs 5.00 DEM (approx. 2.55 Euros) and the CDR costs 15.00 DEM (approx. 7.65 Euros).
</P>
<P>
Because it is still a beta version I would recommend the tape. And with 5.00 DEM an order isn't really a risk.
