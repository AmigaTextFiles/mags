<B>San Diego, CA -</B> OS 3.5 Launch to be held at Amiga Down Under '99<BR><BR>

With the imminent release of OS 3.5 for the Amiga Classic systems available soon, the Amiga Down Under show scheduled for August 21, 22 will be the host event for the official launch of 3.5.
<BR><BR>
OS 3.5 is the first new product for the Amiga in over 5 years, and it includes the integration of the most requested features by Amiga users. "When I took over the management of Amiga, one of my first decisions was to get 3.5 moving and get it shipping.  Now with the release of the external beta, and the imminent release of the shipping version of 3.5, I am pleased to say that we are beginning to ship product”, said Jim Collas  "This is only the beginning of the New Amiga.”
<BR><BR>
"This has been a very exciting project for us, and we know that this is going to be a great product for the Amiga Community” said Juergen Haage of Haage and Partner – the development partner working with Amiga to release 3.5.  "We look forward to the party in Australia to celebrate its release.”
<BR><BR>
OS 3.5 is available through your local Amiga dealer or retailer, and pre-orders are being accepted by most dealers. For those who have pre-ordered 3.5, it will begin shipping as soon as it is released.  We are using the Amiga Down Under show as our celebration party.
<BR><BR>
OS 3.5 features include easy Internet access, support for hard disks greater than 4GB, a modern Graphical User Interface (GUI), extensive CD-ROM support, support for current printers, PowerPC support, HTML Online Documentation, bug fixes, and other product enhancements.
