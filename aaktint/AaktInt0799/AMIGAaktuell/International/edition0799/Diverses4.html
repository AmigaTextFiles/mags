<H1>Photogenics 4</H1><P>
<P>
Finally, after four years of hard work the new version of the well-known
graphic manipulation software Photogenics is available.
<P>
<P>Photogenics is a graphics/art package. It allows you to create stunning
images, either from scratch or by modifying existing images. It can be used for
a multitude of purposes, from simple file conversion, to advanced photo
manipulation and re-touching. It also offers extremely realistic and easy to
use media such as pencils, chalk and watercolours to create stunning
masterpieces in minutes.
<P>
Photogenics is based on innovation.  At its core, it works on images unlike
any other product.  Nothing you draw is permanent, it can be rubbed out as
easily as it was drawn, and tweaked to perfection.  This freedom allows you to
experiment to a level never before seen.
<P>
<H2>Photogenics Feature List:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unparalleled levels of creativity from being able to modify (in real time!)
the colour, transparency, image processing mode, and even the position of what
you have drawn.</LI>
<LI>Realistic Media tools such as Airbrush, Chalk, Pencil, Sponge, Watercolour,
Smudge and Smear.</LI>
<LI>Designed to look and feel good using just a standard mouse.</LI>
<LI>Paint-on Image Processing allows the user to apply effects simply by
drawing with any of the media tools. Being able to just airbrush everything on
(and off!) allows instant touch ups without the need for tedious masking. Paint
modes available include AddColour, Adjust (Brightness/Contrast/Red/Green/Blue),
Bas Relief, BiColour, Blur, Burn, BurnThru, Clone, ColourToGrey, Convolve,
Darken, DifferenceRGB, DisplaceMap, Dodge, EdgeDetect, Emboss, FlipX, FlipY,
Hardlight, Lighten, Min, Max, MotionBlur, Multiply, Negative, Overlay, Paint,
PanBlur, Pixelize, Posterize, RadialBlur, Roll, RubPaint, RubThru, Screen,
Fire, Solarize, Softlight, SubtractColour, and Tint.</LI>
<LI>Exclusive Paint Layer technology allows mistakes to be rubbed out without
having to redo the good parts, simply by fading out with the right mouse button.</LI>
<LI>Unlimited number of easy to use layers allow fast image composition.</LI>
<LI>Stunning Paint-On Pyrotechnics such as lensflares, fire, and explosions. 
Combine with the smear tool to produce supernovas, waves of fire, and even
sunsets and waterfalls.</LI>
<LI> Innovative clutter free user interface (font sensitive and user
scaleable). GUI components can be docked/undocked, and positioned whereever you
please.  </LI>
<LI> Fully Multi-threaded - you&#146;ll never be kept waiting as Photogenics 4
responds instantly to your requests even while operations are in progress.</LI>
<LI>Advanced yet still easy to use Alpha channel support.  Use any open image
as a mask, or simply paint one straight on to the image.  Updates to the Alpha
channel such as brush strokes are reflected on the main image in real time.</LI>
<LI>24bit Alpha channels. Only Photogenics lets you use colour Alpha channels,
which enable you to independently mask each of the red green and blue channels.
Paint on the Alpha with red, and this lets the red component show through,
paint on with yellow, and both the red and green channels are updated. Painting
with shades of grey produce masking as normal. Create awesome effects by
loading in a 24bit Alpha channel and using it to mask image-processing effects.
<LI>Symmetry Tool - combine with any of the Media tools to create amazing
images in seconds.</LI>
<LI>Text Tool - finally you can just click where you want the text, and type it
straight onto any paint layer.  Text remains fully editable until image is Fixed
into the underlying image.</LI>
<LI>Multiple Views &#150; allows you to have as many views of an image as you
like, each with its own magnification.</LI>
<LI>Impressive colour selection facilities, with five colour choosers, RGB and
HSV sliders, and support for 256 colour swatches. You can also pick colours
from Images, with changes updating in real time. </LI>
<LI>Extensive file format support. Current list includes loading and saving
IFF-ILBM, IFF-DEEP, JPEG, Targa, BMP, PNG, with more to follow.
Photogenics also supports loading with 24bit DataTypes.</LI>
<LI>24bit Printing support via StudioPrint.</LI>
<LI> Open Architecture - Photogenics is effectively just one big collection of
plug-ins that blends seamlessly to form one program.  Third party developers can
have access to the same API as Photogenics does, allowing developers to extend
the core software to an amazing degree.</LI>
