<H2>5. Progress report regarding the support of Haage &amp; Partner</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I am an Amiga user for many years and I don't want to change to a different system for all the money in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the job I work with the PC on the job and have to find out all the time:
It's good I have my Amiga.
But there are also exceptions.
</P>
<P>
E.g. STFax - I bought this program hoping I could send faxes, had a telephone answering machine of special nature. Well,
someone can hope a lot, but not everything has to become true.
</P>
<P>
After buying a PowerPC board I also bought ArtEffect (I don't like pirate copying), also in the good believe: Fine, an
extra class program.
</P>
<P>
Well, it was until revision 3.0, but now it is no longer possible to use the PowerUp effects I paid for, the stamp function
can no longer be used, it is faulty.
</P>
<P>
That's not that bad, I thought myself, I write to Haage und Partner, they have a support, that is going to help you.
</P>
<P>
As quickly done as thought. Regarding ArtEffect I promptly got a reply, coming and going, 8 mails alltogether, the bug
hasn't been gone, but there is no help or a status report.
</P>
<P>
Now, I hope you are going to publish this letter and Haage und Partner make a statement, because it can't be, that the
user pays much money for programs and is left alone with a non-working program.
</P>
<P>
I attached the first letter regarding ArtEffect and the letter I wrote regarding STFax.
</P>
<P>
The same problems I have on my computer with my modem occur on my brothers different configured computer (A1200 tower) and
a different modem.
</P>
<P>
Of course, I would be grateful, if you could help.
</P>
<P>
Regards<BR>
