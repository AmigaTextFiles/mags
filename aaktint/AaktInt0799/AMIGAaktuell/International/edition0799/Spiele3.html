<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Today I want to start the preface a different way...: Are there still readers of the AMIGA aktuell games section?
Or are the potencial readers on their summer vacation? Anyway, I got just one mail regarding the games section. This
makes me curious. Is the games section perfect, so there are no things to criticized? Or is the games section that
bad, that it is useless? Or aren't there any more news? Questions and even more questions... I already was afraid I
would be showered with protest eMails due to the last mini edition, but then I got just one eMail. Actually I could
be happy, that is is obvious that there is nothing to say about, but somehow it makes me think. So let's try it with
a more concrete summons: Write me an eMail, how you like the games section, maybe it is really perfect! The eMail doesn't
have to become a whole saga, a few lines will do.
</P>
<P>
But now the news of this month: Even if we are moving towards the silly season there are quite a lot of games news, which
include many announcements, this month. In addition Wasted Dreams was published, how long we had to wait for it! A review
regarding Wasted Dreams can be read right in the next edition. And if we already talk about reviews, let's go into detail:
If everything is going to work fine, you can read reviews of Speccy 99, WET - The sexy Empire, Superfrog and Wasted Dreams
in the next edition. Let's hope, that it will work.
</P>
<P>
The column &quot;New games in the Aminet&quot; is really tiny, this month. This is due to the fact, that the Aminet
mailing list was &quot;down&quot; again. Because after June 11, no more eMail reached me that shows the daily Aminet uploads.
So there are only the new games in the Aminet from May 29 to June 11. Let's hope, that the mailing list is going to run
again.
</P>
<P>
So, then have much fun with this edition,
