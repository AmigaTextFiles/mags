<I>Dan Dodge<BR>CTO, QNX Software Systems</I>
<P>
Last November at Computer 98 in Cologne I promised to
deliver an advanced operating system that would once again
put Amigans at the forefront of technology. Over the past 7
months we have had a team of over 40 engineers working
towards making that promise and vision a reality. We are now
in the final stages of development and are poised to put
these new technologies into the hands of thousands of
serious, enthusiastic developers like yourself.
</P>
<P>
QNX is often compared to UNIX, LINUX and BSD. We do share
the same POSIX APIs, and most code written for these systems
ports easily to QNX, but the resemblance ends there. Based
on 20 years of OS experience, QNX has a radically more
advanced architecture. It's a massively scalable,
multi-threaded, fault-tolerant, realtime OS designed for
devices and computers of any type or size. QNX provides a
unique network architecture where large full-service
protocol stacks aren't required on each computer and
devices plugged into the network are simply "discovered"
automatically by other devices - all services and peripherals
of the new device can then be used by any other device
in the network. QNX is also the only self-hosted RTOS where the
development environment and the runtime target environment
are the same. And though we're not open source, we adopt an
"open source" policy for hardware-specific drivers. This
allows us to continually support the latest hardware
advances, while still maintaining control of core
technology. More importantly, it ensures QNX has a focused
vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
If you haven't visited our web site before, I invite you to
look at the <a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/os/neutrino.html">QNX Realtime OS</a> and
<a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/photon/index.html">Photon microGUI&#174;</a>. If you'd like to dig a little deeper, we've
included some screen shots of the exciting new look-and-feel
for Photon below (click on the image to expand). We've
also put the new <I><a href="http://www.qnx.com/literature/nto_sysarch/nto_sysarch.html">QNX Neutrino System Architecture</a></I>
manual online.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<br>
<P>
In a nutshell, QNX is the core and Photon the graphical
environment for our new OS foundation:
</P>
<P>
<B>QNX</B> - Supports POSIX thread services, MMU protected
memory for all applications and drivers, variety of file
systems (QNX, flash, DOS, CD/DVD-ROM, etc.), TCP/IP stack,
transparent distributed networking, and development
libraries.
</P>
<P>
<B>Photon microGUI</B> - Complete
windowing system with full Unicode support for integrated
internationalization. Also includes visual application
builder (PhAB<sup>TM</sup>), powerful development
environment (layered libraries, over 50 widgets, built-in
image support, online documentation, etc.), web browser,
multimedia player, 3D graphics, and gaming support.
</P>
<P>
Although Photon represents a unique new graphical
environment, it works seamlessly with existing windowing
systems. You can, for example, connect to a Photon desktop
from a Windows desktop or connect to a Windows desktop from
a Photon desktop. And because a large number of existing source
bases use the X Window System, we allow
developers to compile an application for X and then run the
application under Photon. 
<h3>QNX Developers Network for Amigans</h3>
</P>
<P>
To deliver this technology to Amiga developers, we're
creating the <I>QNX Developers Network for Amigans</I>.
Qualified Amiga developers will receive, at no charge, a
complete beta development package that includes the QNX
Realtime OS, a suite of state-of-the-art multimedia
technologies, the unique network-distributed Photon
microGUI, and a self-hosted development environment. We will
also create a dedicated online newsgroup, as well as a web
site to provide technology updates and previews.
</P>
<P>
Initially, we're looking for beta sites interested in
porting existing applications or writing new applications.
Companies and individual developers are both invited to join
- the only thing we ask is commitment. We want active beta
testers, not tire kickers, who will promise to provide
valuable feedback.
</P>
<P>
Of course, commitment goes both ways. So in addition to
starting this program, we will, as of now, become active and
vocal in all the appropriate newsgroups and magazines. We're
looking forward to being a fully active member of the Amiga
community, and to working closely with Amigans to create the
next revolution in multimedia computing.
<h3>Initial Release</h3>
</P>
<P>
Our initial beta release will be for x86 PCs. While this
hardware platform may, at first, seem undesirable to some of
you, remember that most QNX applications and device drivers
are source-identical across CPUs and boards. As a result,
any work done on x86 will migrate easily to any other
supported platform. We chose x86 because it's the hardware
solution most widely available at low cost in the time frame
that we wish to release the first beta - this Fall.
<h3>Are You Interested?</h3>
