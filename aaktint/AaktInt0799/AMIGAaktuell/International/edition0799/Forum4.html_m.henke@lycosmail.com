<H2>4. Dealer progress report: Pernat Hard- &amp; Software (by Ingo Schwedler)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;I have to report of some negative experiences regarding an Amiga dealer, too. Recently (early June) I ordered per
telephone new and used applications and game software for approx. 400 DEM (approx. 204.08 Euros) from PERNAT HARD &amp;
SOFTWARE.
</P>
<P>
I got everything and I used the possibility to pay by VisaCard to save the additional costs for COD. When I got the parcel
and saw the bill I nearly got a heart attack. Not due to the total - no, Mr. Pernat took the payment with VisaCard into
account. It was an additional 20.00 DEM (approx. 10.20 Euros).
</P>
<P>
Then I got the next fright. A game I ordered as used was sent as new and of course, took into account that way. When I
ordered it everything was clarified and confirmed. That there were additional costs for paying with Visa wasn't said.
This information wasn't also on the Internet page. I paid quite a lot with my Visa, but there were no additional fees.
Else it would have been cheaper with COD. When I called them and complained about the wrong delivery (software new instead
of used) and asked about the Visa fees Mr. Pernat became very angry.
</P>
<P>
Fine, after a long discussion they promissed to pay back the addittonal Visa fee and to exchange (again costs for post
and package).
</P>
<P>
For the Visa I really got a cheque for about 20.00 DEM (approx. 10.20 Euros) including the new game I returned.
Notice from the company: Open games cannot excanged. Well, that's correct, but is my fault, that I didn't recognize
a game, that is sticked with a adhesive tape as new and noticed it then after I opened it?
</P>
<P>
And is it my fault, that I got the wrong article per post?
</P>
<P>
This proves again, that a company with good prices hasn't to be the best. Do the companies take advantage from the shrinking of
the competitors in the Amiga market?
