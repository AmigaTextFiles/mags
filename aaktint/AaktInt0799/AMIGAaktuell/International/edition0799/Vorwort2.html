<P>
Hello everybody,
</P>
<P>
as you might read, Amiga, Inc. decided to leave QNX instead of LINUX as a kernel for the new OE (operating environment).
In German forums this decision was criticised, but many people criticised it without knowing what a kernel is. If you
don't know, this may be interesting for you:
</P>
<P>
A kernel is an interface between the hardware and the higher operating system functions. Using a specific kernel (e.g. LINUX)
doesn't mean you can use the software of its platform neither than having other advantages or disadvantages of this platform.
It just controls the hardware, nothing more and nothing less.
</P>
<P>
The decision of using a LINUX-kernel has the advantage, that LINUX-kernals are already present for various platforms, so a
68k/PPC version of the NG-OE would be possible to make. I don't know, whether it was a good idea to swap to the LINUX-kernel
or it would be better with the QNX-kernel and we will never know, so why complaining about that? When the NG-Amiga is ready,
we will see, what we've got. If I like it, I will buy one, if not I won't. But at least, we have to give the new Amiga a chance.
</P>
<P>
Have fun with this edition,
</P>
<P>
yours
