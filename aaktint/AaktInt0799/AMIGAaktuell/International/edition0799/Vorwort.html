+++ AMIGA plans to ship AmigaOS 3.5 on August 21 +++ Development of AmigaNG goes ahead well +++ AMIGA prepares for soon
publication of a product strategy and technology paper +++ AMIGA hires more management employees +++
</P>
<P>
So these are the headlines of June. Welcome in the new edition of AMIGA aktuell international.
</P>
<P>
Ingnoring the activities of AMIGA the last month was quite smooth, but that could be expected due to the beginning summer.
Most attention could get the quick achievement of the 500 advanced orders for the PowerPC version of Fusion by Microcode
Solutions. So it is most likely, that the project could become reality.
</P>
<P>
In this AMIGA aktuell edition a new section has its premiere: Sofiane Ben Hassine does the interview section from now on
and will suport you with the latest interesting interviews.
</P>
<P>
From the next edition on there will be another new section.
</P>

<LI> Is anyone going to go to the 'World of Amiga', which is on July 24/25 in London? Then please sen an eMail to me (<A HREF="mailto:aakt@gmx.de">aakt@gmx.de</A>).</LI>
<BR><LI> The dying of the mailboxes seem to continue: Also the 'Insufficient Menory', which also offered e.g. AMIGA aktuell,
semms no longer to be in service.
<P>
  It would be fine, if I would find out the closing of a mailbox not just from returning mails...

<LI> We are still looking for someone, who wants to do his/her own AMIGA aktuell international
column, that informs about software updates. Each month there are new
revisions for countless FD and commercial AMIGA programs. This new column
should list the most important improvements of new software updates.<BR>
Who is interested of doing that?
</LI>
<LI> We are still looking for testers of freely distributable software.
Everybody who wants to do this job is filled into a special distribution
list, and gets ideas for tests in unregular intervals. You aren' obliged
to perform the tests.
<P>
  Of course, we are happy about tests of commercial products as well.
  Write an eMail to <A HREF="mailto:aakt@gmx.de">aakt@gmx.de</A> .
