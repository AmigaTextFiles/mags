June 16, 1999 - San Diego CA, Langen Germany - Amiga announces the public
beta release of OS 3.5.
   
Amiga and Haage and Partner have announced the public beta release of OS
3.5 for the Amiga.
   
The first external beta version of 3.5 is shipping this week.  The beta
product testing will continue over the next several weeks until the final
product is completed.  Beta testers have been selected from all over the
world, reflecting the global nature of the Amiga Community.
   
"We are excited to be so close to the release of 3.5.  We realize it has been a
long time since there has been an OS update for the Amiga systems and we 
want to make sure there is an ongoing and active interest in the current
generation of Amiga systems as we move towards the release of the new Amiga
products" said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga.
   
We have been working with Haage and Partner to deliver an exciting upgrade
and we now look forward to working with the external beta users to test and
finalize the product for release this summer.
   
OS 3.5 can be pre-ordered through your favorite Amiga dealer.  Many are
also accepting internet orders.
   
Continue to watch the Amiga.com web site for more details, as we get closer
to the release of OS 3.5.
