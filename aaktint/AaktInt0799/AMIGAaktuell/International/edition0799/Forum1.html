<H2>1. Comments regarding the next generation Amiga (by Ralf Driesner)</H2>
<P>
Unfortunately just one reader answered my summons in the last edition to comment the planned next generation Amiga:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Hallo,
</P>
<P>
digital convergence... the new raising magic word of the computer industry has a more futurist character, in the moment.
</P>
<P>
But futuristic doesn't mean phantastic...
</P>
<P>
In the past there were some attempts (some were smiled at) of german and international manufacturers to put machines on
the market, which were &quot;all-in-one&quot;, so they should focus as many functions and applications as possible.
</P>
<P>
But the marketing of these &quot;I can do nearly anything&yuot;-machines was not that successful.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons of these mistakes may have been the bad integration of the devices into the complete system. So
there were operating systems being used, which were known for their frequency of crashes and integrated system bugs. In
addition there were hardware components being used, which could only be used for playing some games or easy internet
applications due to their antique memory management.
</P>
<P>
Further the cooperation of the SVGA and the TV standards PAL/NTSC hadn't been integrated fine; even the Amiga couldn't
create miracles with the technology present at that time (even with the 15 kHz-technic).
</P>
<P>
How does the future look like? Better technology, continuing digitalizing of TV and radio, Internet 2 and similar things
solve the infrastructural problems. Better computer, which are currently under development promiss breathtaking possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Amiga with Jim Collas on the top could be able to reach the currently (nearly) impossible target: user-friendly, cheap and
highly integrated technology... put into a nice skin. Even if the concept drawings of the Amiga NG are just a makeshift
resp. broach the new computer revolusion nearly unnoticeable... the target is clear.
</P>
<P>
If this technology should get its way the Gateway shareholders can lean back, when watching the charts and the saying &quot;Future
belongs to the paranoid&quot; could become bitter reality for some copmuter giants...
</P>
<P>
So, let's wait for it
</P>
