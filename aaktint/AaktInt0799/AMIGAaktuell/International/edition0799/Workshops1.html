<H2>1. Report: AmigaOS 3.5 presentation at AmiPoint (by Thorsten Schoelzel)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;AmigaOS3.5-Praesentation beim Amiga-User Meeting des AUGGD &amp; PCC
</P>
<P>
This presentation was made with the support of Marc Gerlitzki in the shop of AmiPoint. But no only that, but also other
things of general interest for the Amiga users like AmiAtlas 5, sound card Delfina or ApusPPC. Another point of interest
was the show of Tornado3D. Andreas Weyrauch, who showed this program, went to great trouble to show the sers all the
important details &amp; features of this program.
</P>
<P>
A small attraction was, most likely, the Amiga 1000, on which ran the old Boing-Ball demo.
</P>
<P>
I took part on this meeting since 11:00 a.m. Those who thought there would not have come many Amiga users was wrong.
Around 1:00 p.m. the shop was crowded. Once more someone didn't feel alone you really felt, that the Amiga community
lives.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly around 2:00 p.m. there was a hectic atmosphere, when the users shouted, that Mr. Haage was coming, then he
came acompanied by his wife. He carried a package of Haage&amp;Partner-CDs, but also some stickers with him.
</P>
<P>
For the show an A1200 in infinitive tower, 1240/40 MHz processor, CyberVision64/3D, 16 MB RAM and an 1 GB SCSI hard disk
were used.
</P>
<P>
We couldn't wait to see when Mr. Haage began to install the beta version of the OS 3.5 update. In the beginning there
were problems, that coulc be solved after approx. 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the Installer script, but if it was changed a little bit the next try could be started an it was lucky.
</P>
<P>
On the installation OS 3.5 creates an emergency disk first, after that the system is restarted and OS 3.5 is being installed.
Everybody, who owns OS 3.1 (which is absolutely required to install the OS 3.5 update, anyway) rembembers the disk staples
of various yards. Help is made with an option, which is also shipped on the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
Because an option has been created, that allows to install OS 3.1. But the original 3.1 disks are required to install
OS 3.5 after that.
</P>
<P>
But one problem is anywhere and there is one, too: Unfortunately OS 3.5 as well as OS 3.1 can be installed only via the normal
Amiga modes, thish should not make any big problems, because any user should at least own one TV at home.
</P>
<P>
To return to the emergency disk, if you begin to install OS 3.5: Unfortunately a DD-disk doesn't offer enough space, that
the graphics board drivers had enough space, but unfortunately it is not possible to use HD-disks, because the DD-drive
is spreaded too much. But they are thinking about a solution.
</P>
<P>
The practical test!
</P>
<P>
The interface looks much nicer than with the old Amiga icons. Included is the OS 3.5 logo as a background picure, as you
know it from the advertisments.
</P>
<P>
If you execute some tools or preferences there are some new things showing. Meanwhile very many of this reworked prgorams
use the Reaction interface.
</P>
<P>
This is the very much extended ClassAct system, that is very fast and in conformity with the system.
</P>
<P>
New is the support of 3 (!) different icon collections, whether the Amiga icons (old icons), the NewIcons or the GlowIcons,
this new icon.library manages them all. Problems as they occured in the past due to the different colours will no longer
be there.
</P>
<P>
More details were revealed regarding the integrated WWW browser AWeb, that is not going to support JavaScript. This information
hit us users hard, because we expected an extended version of AWeb 1.2, including JavaScript-1.2 support.
</P>
<P>
Miami will be a special version, too. The manual will be on the CD-ROM either in HTML- as well as in PDF format, but no
viewer will be included, so that the manual cannot be shown, but printed, thanks to an alternate program.
</P>
<P>
Now it is also possible to create a new drawer from a request and new commands have been added, if you want to clean up
the contents of the desired partition.
</P>
<P>
But where is the real new stuff?
</P>
<P>
These are internal, of course, e.g. the loading of the Workbench as well as the open of partition has been sped up many
times.
</P>
<P>
The whole system seems to became more robust, you notice, that the AmigaOS adapts to the operating system of other
platforms, but it will also be in the style of the Amiga. The Datatypes have been reworked and as a gift a GIF-Datatype
is already included.
</P>
<P>
Many things have been improved internally, so the user doesn't notice it in daily use.
So: It is worth to buy it!
</P>
<P>
When the first presentation was over, which was especially for the visitors of the meeting surprisingly the company
IOM Film &amp; Videoproduktion came, which we had not known until that moment. This company is known for the production of
the AmigaOS 3.5 commercial. Dir &quot;Docki&quot; Dockbreyder showed the update again, but with less visitors in the shop.
Mr. Haage commented this new presentation. First results of the OS 3.5 commercial are to be shown on the Amiga'99, we
can't wait to see them.
</P>
<P>
This commercial is to be shown in regional TV stations, when OS 3.5 is available. There are considerations in progress to
advertise more in the (German magazine) Computer Bild, but this is a question of costs, which has to be answered first.
But this would be one more step to bring the name Amiga into the mind of other people.
</P>
<P>
Of course, we had to make an interview with Mr. Haage. Read yourself, how he answered our questions:
</P>
<P>
Questions regarding the AmigaOS 3.5 update:
</P>
<P>
1.) Will AmigaOS 3.5 finally be available on the Downunder '99 show?
</P>
<P>
They try to get the update ready for the Downunder show.
</P>
<P>
2.) What made the TCP/IP stack Miami part of AmigaOS 3.5, if the first informations were in opposition to that?
</P>
<P>
They were in talks with Active Software for an eventually integration of Genesis into OS 3.5, but Miami offered a better
solution. On one hand Holgere Kruse is well-known in the Amiga community on the other hand Miami is based on ClassAct
resp. on the new Reaction system. So a conversion of Genesis, that is MUI based has become useless. This would also have
taken too much time. It would also have been nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
This is why they chose AWeb as browser instead of IBrowse or Voyager.
</P>
<P>
3.) Will Warp3D included in OS 3.5?
</P>
<P>
Revision 2.0 of Warp3D will be shipped with the OS 3.5-CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
But not just Warp3D, but StormMesa will be shipped with it, too and a lot of other tools, which reside in an own drawer
on the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
4.) Why haven't been any drivers included to connect DVD-drives to the Amiga?
</P>
<P>
They are currently developing drivers for DVD-drivers. If they can integrate them in time for the sale start, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
5.) According to rumours it is expected, that AmigaOS 3.5 becomes a losing deal. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
Haage&amp;Partner expects, that approx. 20,000 copies have to be sold to become no losing deal. We would be satisfied
with that.
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Haage it will be approx. 50,000 copies. But there would not be any consequences, if 20,000 copies
cannot be sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
6.) Are there any &quot;more concrete&quot; considerations for an OS 3.6, 4.0 etc?
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are some, but OS 3.5 remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Questions regarding the NG-Amigas:
</P>
<P>
7.) Do you think, that the prototype of the developer-NG-Amiga is shown on the Amiga'99 show?
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Haage: &quot;I hope it!&quot;
</P>
<P>
8.) How do you evaluate the concept drawings of the NG-Amigas, is this the right way?
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Mr. Haage doesn't like concept drawings very much, because they can change any time.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Haage is quite sure, that it will not be just one device, but there will be more devices, like e.g. a handheld device.
</P>
<P>
9.) When will there be the first software from Haage &amp; Partner for the NGs? Will they develop software for the NG-Amiga, anyway?
</P>
<P>
Mr. Haage: &quot;Yes, of course!!&quot;
Of course, they will not forget the Classic line, they want to leave both options open. If the NG becomes a giant success,
they think of going in line completely.
</P>
<P>
But it is difficult to arrange someones employees, because it is little known about the NG-AmigaOS. Currently we will stay
completely with Classic line, but there are considerations, what will be ported first to the NG.
</P>
<P>
Questions regarding the PPC processor:
</P>
<P>
The PowerPC board &quot;Twister&quot; is the product of a cooperation between Tintan Computer, ACT (Apollo) and Haage &amp; Partner. Is
Haage &amp; Partner responsible for the implementation of the PPC operating software or does the company have any far-reaching jobs in this
matter?
</P>
<P>
Haage &amp; Partner is only responsible for the software emulation. The hardware will be made by ACT and Titan Computer
will make the driver software for the SCSI kit available.
</P>
<P>
11.) Are there more details regarding the &quot;Twister&quot;?
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Mr. Haage didn't know further details regarding the Twister project. But everything is arranged, everybody
knows his job and they know, what has to be done.
</P>
<P>
12.) Is the rumour of a G3 computer by Amiga International true, when will it come?
</P>
<P>
Mr. Haage: &quot;Good question!&quot;
If it can be realised hasn't been completely decided, there are various factors, which have to be solved in cooperation
with Phase 5, which is primary involved with the hardware development. It is not the software, there is a nice bundle,
but what has to be kept an eye on is an attractive price. They want to try to bring a G3-Amiga computer on the market for
less than 2,000 DEM (approx. 1,020.41 Euros).
</P>
<P>
In addition they want to show a first prototpye on the World of Amiga'99 show.
</P>
<P>
Questions regarding the (German) AmigaNG magazine:
</P>
<P>
13.) As you know I am the organisator of the AmigaNG magazine project. How do you evaluate this project (honest answer!)
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately Mr. Haage hasn't really any thoughts on this matter, yet.
</P>
<P>
14.) Would you support us?
</P>
<P>
Herr Haage: &quot;Of course!&quot;
</P>
<P>
Overall conclusion:
</P>
<P>
You see, something gets done, not just due to the AmigaOS 3.5 update or the concept drawings. You should keep an eye
on the World of Amiga'99, because more details and future plans will be presented to the Amiga useres, there. Eventually
with a prototype of the G3 computer or a prototype of the developer-NG-Amiga. Anyway, it will become hot,
