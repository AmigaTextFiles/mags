<CENTER><H2>Amiga selects Linux as their Next Generation OS Kernel</H2></CENTER><BR>
 
<B>July 9, 1999 - </B>San Diego, California. Amiga has selected Linux as the OS kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment that is scheduled for release later this year.   Amiga is selecting Linux after several months of evaluating the technical progress of the OS and the tremendous industry support that Linux has gained.

<P>The development community has given Linux a major endorsement and the momentum that Linux now enjoys is having a significant impact on the computer industry.  There are a large number of hardware device drivers and software applications written for Linux already and this number is growing daily.  

<P>"Our strategy for implementing the new Amiga is to integrate the best technology in the industry into a new, efficient, exciting and revolutionary computer platform focused on the future” said Jim Collas, President and CEO of Amiga. "Using Linux as our OS kernel is only one component of the overall Amiga Operating Environment.”


<P><P>Look for more information on the choice of Linux as part of the overall Amiga Operating Environment in the Executive Update section of our web site.
