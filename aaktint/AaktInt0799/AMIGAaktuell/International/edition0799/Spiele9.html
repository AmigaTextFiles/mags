<H2>9. Emulator news</H2>
<P>
The SNES emulator WarpSNES has been released in a new revision. In WarpSNES 3.5a a tiny bug has been removed, that could
result in a crash.
</P>
<P>
Also the Nintendo 64 emulator TrueReality has been released in a new revision. Except a few demos no software doesn't run
(, of course). The new revision is based on the source code of the June edition of the TrueReality emulator.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the PC emulator PCx as well as of the Apple Macintosh emulator Fusion announced, that at least 500 advanced
bookings are necessary for each program to create the PPC modules for both programs. The deadline for the advanced bookings
is July 1, so it is over as you read it. A PPC module for Fusion is going to come, because there are more than 500 advanced
bookings (who wonders...). Let's hope, that PCx will also make its way to the PPC.
</P>
<P>
A new revision of the Macintosh emulator Basilisk II has been published on the homepage of the author Christian Bauer.
The same author also made the Macintosh emulator ShapeShifter, that is going to get just trivial fixes. The future lies
with Basilisk II, that is available for many platforms. The new revision also supports e.g. audio-CD as well as serial and
Ethernet networks.
</P>
<P>
A new revision of the MSX emulator fMSX has also been released and can be downloaded from the Aminet.
