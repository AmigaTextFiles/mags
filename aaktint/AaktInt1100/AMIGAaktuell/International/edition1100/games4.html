<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">It became known two months ago that CS&amp;E would withdraw from the Amiga market and now David Connolly has made a final statement. He states that it simply does not pay any more to offer commercial products for the Amiga. He dissociates himself as well from the New Amiga. From now on CS&amp;E only will produce for the PC.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">But it now appears that Amiga games will after all be released in Germany. For this purpose a contract was signed with Dirk Harlaar, who will take over the distribution.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

A playable demo version of the long expected Command &amp; Conquer clone &quot;Earth 2140&quot; finally was released this month. It fills a lazy 20 Megabytes and needs at least a 68040/25Mhz, a graphics board and 24 MBytes RAM. In this edition is a preview of this demo.

<LI> Exodus
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
During this month a playable demo version of the Command &amp; Conquer clone &quot;Exodus - The Last War&quot; was published. The demo version spans 14 Megabytes compressed, and I would have offered you a preview, but that was not possible because the server was permanently overloaded. The distribution of this real-time strategic game will be in the hands of Blittersoft.

<LI> The World Foundry
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The World Foundry appears to have withdrawn from the Amiga market and may be closing down communication generally. Amiga Future reported that the development of the games &quot;Maim &amp; Mangle&quot; and &quot;Explorer 2260&quot; is continuing independently under programmer Chris Page. The responsibility of The World Foundry has ended. Furthermore the website <A HREF="http://www.worldfoundry.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.worldfoundry.com/</A> has disappeared. All the signs point to The World Foundry liquidating, if they have not done so already.
