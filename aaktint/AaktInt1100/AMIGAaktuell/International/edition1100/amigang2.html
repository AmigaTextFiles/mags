<P><B>The Next Computing Revolution</B></P>
<P>
The world is going through dramatic changes. Consumer Electronics companies
are adding traditional computer features to their products, and computer
companies are adding traditional Consumer Electronics features to their
products. This leaves the consumer confused and stuck with no clear
choice. This chasm of confusion needs to be crossed and Amiga is the
bridge that will cross it and bring consumers, Consumer Electronics
Companies, and traditional Computer companies together and heading in the
right direction.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga - The Beginning of The Future</B></P>
<P>
In 1985 the Commodore Amiga A1000 (right) was introduced to the world and
nothing like it had been seen before. People were amazed. Over the next 15
years individuals, families, and companies purchased millions of Amigas and
were introduced to a whole new world of computing. Since then Amiga users
have changed computing for everyone with revolutionary ideas, creative
implementations and innovative advancements, all brought about by the
elegance and simplicity of the Amiga computer.
</P>
<P>
It has taken the rest of the industry 15 years to catch up to Amiga. Now
they never will.
</P>
<P><B>The New Amiga</B></P>
<P>
Computing today should not be hardware specific, but content specific. A
computer should work the way you think, not the other way around. It
should be easy to use and scalable, meeting everyone's needs. There should
be easy access to what is important to the user without the user having to
worry about the constraints or compatibilities of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
The current strategy of offering different operating systems for different
devices is a flawed strategy and cannot succeed. There must be a cohesive,
scalable operating system that provides brilliant multimedia performance on
all supported products supported, from cell phones to multi-processor
servers.
</P>
<P>
Amiga, Inc. with our partner The Tao Group, Inc., is developing a new breed
of operating system that is so radical and revolutionary that it requires a
new name: The Digital Environment (DE).
</P>
<P>
It is time for a scalable, easy-to-use Digital Environment that will foster
the creation of content and provide convenient, intuitive features and
functions.
</P>
<P><B>Features of the Amiga Digital Environment</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> &quot;Write Once- Run Everywhere&quot; -- This statement has been the mantra for
     tired and weary developers. The new Amiga is being designed to make
     good on this promise and present developers with unprecedented
     options and flexibility.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Scalability - Because the new Amiga DE is less than 5 megabytes, Amiga
     is scalable, and can fit on a cell phone and scale up to
     multi-processor servers. All content created for Amiga is 100% binary
     compatible. This means that developers are able to create content and
     applications and deal with the markets they want to target.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Content Creation Through Software Development -- For the developer,
     the new Amiga is 100% binary compatible across all platforms
     supported. This means that an application can truly be written one
     time and can operate in hosted environments (running on top of or
     through another OS) such as Windows, Windows NT, Linux, Windows CE,
     Palm, Epoc, OS/9, iTron, QNX, VXWorks, and others. This fact alone
     has the potential to redefine the development of computer games.
     Amiga can also operate the entire system with native versions of the
     DE for PPC, x.86, StrongARM, ARM, Hitachi SH, NEC 85x, M*Core, Mips,
     and others.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Amiga developers are able to use Java, C, C++, or Amiga VP Assembler
     in creating their applications. This flexibility is already gaining
     new market acceptance as over 1,000 Amiga Software Development Kits
     (right) have been sold, and with the new additions of 3D, Sound, and
     User Experience API's it is sure to gain even more ground as the
     developers platform of choice.
</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Benefits to Hardware OEMs</B></P>
<P>
For the hardware OEM, Amiga is an operating system that provides a scalable
solution and the ability to select and utilize their hardware of choice.
These choices include a minimum of 25 different CPU architectures that
encompass at least 10 different operating system environments. Of course,
offers multi-processor support, too.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Amiga DE can be ported to new CPU architectures in as
little as 2 to 3 months as opposed to the massive 6 to 18 month effort it
would take to port a traditional operating system to a new CPU
architecture. This allows great cost savings and flexibility to the
hardware OEM.
</P>
<P>
Another benefit for the hardware OEM is content. As new devices enter the
market, and new markets are being developed it is in the area of content
that the Amiga can really enhance an OEM's offering. By using the Amiga DE
hardware OEMs can offer much greater value added products than those who
don't use the Amiga DE. Just imagine a set-top box manufacturer who can
offer not only full Internet and home entertainment features on their
system, but stunning games, Java applications, video editing capabilities,
and programming tools, too.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga DE will allow the OEM to do all these things with one cohesive,
scalable operating environment that communicates between itself and any
other device connected to the system that uses the Amiga DE.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Community</B></P>
<P>
Amiga, Inc. is not the typical emerging company: It is already a worldwide
recognized brand name that is synonymous with ease of use and multimedia.
The Amiga development community numbers in the tens of thousands and it
releases software and hardware on a near daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Many current AAA gaming companies, such as Psygnosis, Sierra, Westwood,
Lucas Arts, Team 17, and others, received their start on the Amiga
platform and are excited by the prospect of the new Amiga. Developers
remember fondly the heyday of the Classic Amiga and look forward to a day
when software development will be as simple and elegant as it was on the
Classic Amiga. Many users remember the way their Amiga rarely crashed,
booted quickly, presented seamless animation and made efficient use of
resources. The new Amiga will bring all this back.
</P>
<P>
With the release of the Amiga SDK, developers around the world have begun
creating applications. In addition to the 45,000+ titles that are already
available for the Amiga - many of which are likely candidates for porting
to the new Amiga--the products listed below are in the process of being
ported directly to the new Amiga Digital Environment.

<P><B>The AmigaONE</B></P>
<P>
Very soon the world will meet the next Amiga (the AmigaONE) and it will
amaze users with its simplicity and power. The world will finally have an
operating system (or Digital Environment) that gives the worldwide digital
revolution the means to address all users.
</P>
<P>
Software developers will be able to write once and run their software on
dozens of different operating systems. The Amiga DE can be scaled to fit
the needs of any application, from cell phone messaging systems to
full-scale university databases.
</P>
<P>
Users and developers need only become familiar with one operating system
that works on everything from their car information center to their
workplace desktop to their home entertainment system. No more cumbersome
software porting, no more conflicting standards, no more compatibility
problems. It will work on your home computer, your work computer, your
school computer and your handheld computer, regardless of the OS the
device currently uses.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga will bring the power of the silicon chip into the hands of the
masses because it will be easy and painless to use. It will be something
even technophobes can understand. It is about simplicity and giving power
to the users who are tired of having to think like a computer to use one.
Amiga will make the computer think and act like we do-effortlessly-and
make computing and using computers an easy, coherent and enjoyable
experience.
</P>
<P>
We hope you'll come along for the ride.
