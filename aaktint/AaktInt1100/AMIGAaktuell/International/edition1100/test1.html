<H2>1. Little helpers for everyday Amiga usage (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
First of all, I must apologize that the last issue of &quot;little helpers&quot; had to be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
An accident with a motorbike took me out of action. But I'm over the worst and the plaster will come off in 3 weeks. My motorbike wasn't very damaged and the season is almost over anyway. Once again, I was lucky ;) ! Thanks to everyone who dropped me a mail.
</P>
<P>
Since I had a lot of time this month to spend with my computer and the Internet, I'm delivering two articles - take it as a compensation. As &quot;Little helpers&quot; I chose for this month &quot;TheMPegEncGUI&quot;, the Internet service &quot;Downloadslave&quot;, the device driver &quot;DEV-Handler&quot; and the Internet radio player &quot;StreAmi&quot;. I hope there is something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
And here we go...
</P>
<P><B>TheMPegEncGUI:</B></P>
<P>
The name says it all. TheMPegEncGUI is a MUI-based, graphical front-end for programs - seven of them to be more precise - for en-/decoding of MPEG audio files. Among those programs are the MPEG3 encoders MusicIn, NCode and MP3Enc, the &quot;(L)ame (a)in't an (m)peg3 (e)ncoder&quot; Lame, the MPEG2 encoder Pegase and the MPEG decoder MPEGA.
</P>
<P>
At first glance, you are stricken by the sheer number of buttons and input fields. But because all the arguments of each program are supported, it is really astonishing that all the parameters fit in the relatively small window of TheMPegEncGUI.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A good thing is that not all programs have to be installed, since the functions of the encoders overlap sometimes. TheMPegEncGUI leaves it up to you to use only the programs you actually have installed on your system. This reduces the configuration work and is more flexible. Also very comfortable is the integrated tag editor, which lets you save additional information to the MPEG file, such as genre, author, release date, etc.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

</P>
<P>
&quot;Clicking instead of typing&quot; is the main motto behind TheMPegEncGUI, but you will still have to think for yourself. In other words, you still should read the documentation of the supported programs to know what a certain button does. The AmigaGuide (in English) only describes the user interface of TheMPegEncGUI itself. MUI bubble-help for further explanations is not supported. And &quot;MUI&quot; takes us directly to the system requirements.
</P>
<P>
Generally, TheMPegEncGUI runs on any Amiga that is capable of running MUI. This is not very much (020/2MB/OS2/Bla/Bla). But to avoid getting gray hairs or a long beard while de-/encoding MPEG audio files, at least a 68060 CPU, or better a PPC board is required. If a PowerUP board is present, the de-/encoder should support it, of course.

<P><B>Downloadslave:</B></P>
<P>
Downloadslave isn't a typical Amiga program, but a useful internet service. It works very simply: Downloadslave sends files via email. This sounds useless, since you can get files easily with a browser or a FTP client. But it isn't always (surprise! ;) )! If you want to get files from a very slow or overloaded server, this can cost a lot of time, and if you don't have flat rate access also a lot of money.
When using Downloadslave, you don't have to worry about such servers anymore. It may take a while for the files to reach you, but they reach you(!) and can be downloaded at a decent speed from the email server.
</P>
<P>
To be able to use this service, you have to register. This doesn't hurt and is free. Just send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:data@downloadslave.com.">data@downloadslave.com.</A> The subject must be empty and the mail shouldn't contain any text either. Shortly after, you will receive a reply, containing a password and a small documentation on how to use Downloadslave. You really shouldn't give this password away, or you might find some unordered MP3 files in your mailbox on 1st of April ;).
When you want to get some files from the Internet, take a note of the complete URL (starting with &quot;<A HREF="http://" TARGET="_top">http://</A>&quot; or &quot;<A HREF="ftp://"" TARGET="_top">ftp://&quot;</A>). You may want to use the clipboard to make this as painless and comfortable as possible. Now write an email to &quot;<A HREF="mailto:data@downloadslave.com">data@downloadslave.com</A>&quot;. The first and second line has to contain the URLs, the third the password in this form:
</P>
<P>PASS:ABCDEFGHIJ</P>
<P>
You will then receive the requested files later as attachments in your mailbox. You will also receive a small advertising mail, since Downloadslave has to cover its costs.
Unfortunately, the number of files per mail is limited to 2 (at least with YAM, see below).
</P>
<P>
But you can send several requests at once, so this is not really a handicap. A little odd is the fact that, when sending requests with YAM, the first file is always the HTML index files of the YAM homepage. This file is only 12 KBytes and so doesn't really count against the more typical several MBytes of data. But this problem is annoying because it lowers the limit of requests per mail from 3 to 2.
</P>
<P>
[Maybe downloadslave.com is just looking for the first three URLs in a mail, and finds the URL to the homepage of YAM, which is contained in every YAM mail inside the header. It can easily be removed with any text editor. --Remark of editor in chief]
</P>
<P>
You should also make sure that the files will fit into your mailbox. Most email providers offer only a limited space for emails, which in turn limits the size of the files you can request.

<P><B>DEV-Handler:</B></P>
<P>
DEV-Handler is an Amiga device driver that makes it possible to access the sectors of AmigaDOS drives with every program.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Dev-Handler.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Dev-Handler.jpg" WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
This makes the creation of an image file from CD-ROMs, ZIPs or other physical device very easy. But is also makes it easy to destroy the data structure on such media - if it is write enabled. So before using it, you should know what you want to do.
</P>
<P>
The installation is easy. Unpack the archive and copy the &quot;Device-Handler&quot; to the &quot;DEVS:&quot; directory. The file &quot;DEV&quot; should be dragged to the Workbench directory Storage/DOSDrivers, so that &quot;DEV:&quot; is not automatically mounted at boot time, a precaution which is advisable.
</P>
<P>
When you mount the drive &quot;DEV:&quot; from a shell (&quot;mount DEV:&quot;), you can use AmigaDOS commands to access the data structure on physical drives (the RAM disk and logical assign to directories like &quot;Fonts:&quot;, &quot;S:&quot; etc are not physical drives!).
</P>
<P>
So if you want to create a backup (a &quot;disk image file&quot;) of the physical partition hd0:, you just enter this command in your shell:
</P>
<P>
copy dev:hd0 Backup:Workbench.image
</P>
<P>
But make sure that the (&quot;logical&quot;) drive &quot;Backup:&quot; has enough space, since the above command will copy the entire partition &quot;HD0:&quot;, even the unused space, into the file &quot;Workbench.image&quot; on &quot;Backup:&quot;.
</P>
<P>
DEV-Handler doesn't care about differences between filesystems, you can also make images from HFS- (Macintosh), MS-DOS- or ext2fs- (Linux) filesystems.
</P>
<P>
Just as easy is writing back an image file to restore a backup. Just reverse the above command:
</P>
<P>
copy Backup:Workbench.image dev:hd0
</P>
<P>
Because we now really write to a drive, great care is needed! So make really sure that you didn't confuse hd0 with hd1 or dh0, since all data on the partition is deleted (or overwritten). Furthermore, the size of the partition must exactly match the size of the image file.
</P>
<P>
DEV-Handler also proved very useful in creating ADF files for Amiga emulations on other platforms. In the above example, replace dh0 with the appropriate floppy drive (&quot;df0&quot;, &quot;df1&quot;, etc.).
</P>
<P>
The creation of an Amiga disk from an ADF files works the same way. To write the file &quot;floppy1.adf&quot; to the disk in drive &quot;Df0:&quot;, enter:
</P>
<P>
copy floppy1.adf to dev:df0
</P>
<P>
Other interesting possibilities can be used for example with the command &quot;type&quot;
</P>
<P>
type dev:hd0 hex
</P>
<P>
...displays the data structure of the partition &quot;hd0:&quot; in hexadecimal format.
</P>
<P>
But the DEV-Handler can do even more - you can pass the device driver, the unit and some other parameters to &quot;DEV:&quot;. You should read the short English manual for more about this.

<P><B>StreAmi:</B></P>
<P>
StreAmi is a client for Internet radio station that broadcast their programs as MPEG audio streams. To listen to one of these station, you need besides StreAmi also MUI, AHI, mpega.library and an Internet connection. It's also important that the radio station uses the server format Icecast or Shoutcast.
</P>
<P>
The user interface is very simple. The main window contains only two buttons, one to open a connection to the radio server and the other one to open the preferences window of StreAmi. Above them is a text input box with a popup symbol, where you can call a pre-defined Internet radio station. The menu is just as simple.
&quot;Project/Serverlist&quot; opens the server editor (more below) and &quot;Project/Quit&quot; exits StreAmi.
What else?
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/StreAmi.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/StreAmi.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="45" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
StreAmi comes with a pre-configured server list containing 3 radio stations. This is enough for some experiments. When you select a station with the popup button and press &quot;Connect&quot;, StreAmi starts to play immediately after successful connection.
</P>
<P>
To avoid cracking or skipping music, a fast Internet connection and also a fast computer is advisable. A soundcard that is able to decode MPEG on its own wouldn't be bad, either, more so because it will play the music at a better quality.
As mentioned above, you can use the menu entry &quot;Project/Server List&quot; to call the server editor of StreAmi. Since the default configuration only contains three stations, you have limited choice. So let's change that... But how??
The documentation doesn't say anything about it, so be glad that you have me, because I figured it out. ;). Point your web browser to www.shoutcast.com or www.icecast.org. Then let it list &quot;All Channels&quot;. Now you have to be patient, because the whole list contains about 1300 stations and takes a while to load. When this is done, you may disconnect from the Internet. Now look for a station you are interested in and move your mouse over the &quot;Play&quot; button. Your browser now shows you an URL (IBrowse and Voyager show it down the bottom, AWeb on the top of the screen. It should look like this (in the red frame):
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Serverlist.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Serverlist.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="95" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
And that's all you need. Remember the URL and enter the address after &quot;server=&quot; as URL in StreAmi (in this example, this would be 195.138.40.110). As &quot;Port&quot; we enter the number after &quot;port=&quot; in the servers URL (8000 for example). Now enter the name of the Station, click on &quot;Add&quot; and you are set.
</P>
<P>
Not so good is StreAmi's behavior when the server you are trying to connect to is nonexistent or offline. It open an error requester that cannot be closed - StreAmi hangs! My Amiga didn't crash because of it, but it is annoying nevertheless.
