<H2>6. Survey: The new AmigaOne and the AmigaDE (by Stefan Czinczoll)</H2>
<P>
The Amiga Digital Environment is expected to offer more than conventional operating systems. It aims at a future for computer applications which more and more experts concede is important: the use of distributed resources within a system.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the lowest layer of the AmigaDE, the physical layer, consists of all hardware devices: harddisk storage, processor(s), sound and graphics boards, printers, etc.
</P>
<P>
In the next layer are the components which are being developed by the Tao Group: The Elate RealTime OS, the AVE (Audio Visual Environment) and the Java Runtime Environment certificated by SUN.
</P>
<P>
Additionally there are several components developed by AMIGA, such as the Amiga Object Model and a conversion of the well known Mesa 3D Graphics Libraries. All this constitutes the Amiga Foundation Layer.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore a new programming language is being developed, which can be used directly in a command line (shell), or used as scripting language for process control, and of course in the development of applications.
The temporary name of this development is &quot;Sheep&quot;. An experimental version of this language for Elate can be found on the REBOL website.
</P>
<P>
The next layer offers a real qualitative technical innovation: the AmiVerse. The AmiVerse is a digital data range, spread over a single machine or any number of computers. Under Amiverse, the user will be able to do anything imaginable inside computers: execution of applications, import/export of data objects, production and consumption of digital contents, etc.
</P>
<P>
This development, combined with the idea of the Virtual Processor in Tao's Elate, is without exaggeration a small technical revolution. AMIGA should not be afraid to start an all-out promotional strategy as soon as the system is ready and able to be demonstrated. This is one of the few aspects where the new Amiga has the edge over its bigger rivals.
</P>
<P>
Too good to be true? Well, here is the bad news: According to Eyetech the use of a G3/G4 processor is almost compulsory to be able to enjoy the AmiVerse. Other World Computing apparently has 266 MHz G3 processors available at a price of 35$ (www.macsales.com).
</P>
<P>
So, for access to the AmigaDE (and for emulation of the Classic AmigaOS) a G3/G4 board will be needed. Alternatively, it ought to be possible to host the AmigaDE on a Linux system. But this is not much of an option for all those users who have installed an expensive Blizzard/CyberstormPPC board specced below the G3, especially because there is not yet Linux support for some things e.g. for the SCSI controller of the Cyberstorm.
</P>
<P>
But for all those who were intending to buy a new computer the AmigaOne is a good choice.
</P>
<P>
