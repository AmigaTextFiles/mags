<H2>2. Hardware test report: &raquo;Elsa Microlink ISDN Internet&laquo; (by Chr. Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
Now that German Telekom has finally installed ISDN in my new apartment, I went looking for a new ISDN-TA (Terminal-Adapter, sometimes (wrongly) called an ISDN modem). After very good experiences with the Elsa Microlink 56k, it was easy to decide for an &quot;Elsa Microlink ISDN Internet&quot;. Unlike some other external adapters, this TA is almost a decoration for your desktop with its design inspired by Apple's iMac (bondi blue). Its compact size of 31x93x123mm (HeightxLengthxDepth) doesn't take up much room, either.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MicroLinkISDN.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/MicroLinkISDN.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="93" ALT="Bild"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
This external TA is available at any PC dealer [this might not be true outside of Germany -remark of translator] around the corner. But you can also buy it from almost any Amiga dealer (KDH for example). It is important to buy a version that can be connected to the serial port. Elsa also makes a similar TA with a USB interface (it is called &quot;Elsa Microlink ISDN USB&quot;). If you intend to buy from a PC dealer, you should make sure which version you buy.
</P>
<P><B>Price</B></P>
<P>
The price is somewhere between 190.- and 220.- DM (95 to 110 Euro). But don't be fooled by mail order companies who offer it for maybe 190.- and then add 50.- for postage/packing/insurance etc. Most of the big PC mail order companies do that. Better get it from an Amiga dealer. They need the money much more, anyway.
And you might need an adapter to connect the 25-pin connector of the Amiga's serial interface to the 9-pin serial port of the cable from the TA. This adapter costs between 8.- and 15.- DM (4 to 8 Euro).
</P>
<P><B>What's included?</B></P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A small manual of 50 pages describes the installation under Windows9x/NT (useless except for the AT command overview). A CD-ROM called &quot;Microlink ISDN Internet&quot; not only contains several Windows drivers, but also the documentation in PDF format. Another CD-ROM (&quot;Elsanet&quot;) contains all HTML documents, files and driver from the Elsa homepage for offline browsing. And finally there is the obligatory AOL CD-ROM, suitable only for recycling or as a coaster. The hardware side consists of the TA itself, the mains adapter, a serial cable (MiniDIN8 to DSub-9) and a cable of 3 metres length for connection to the phone line. Mind you the serial cable only has a 9-pin connector. If you want to use this TA on the built-in serial port (not recommended) or a Silversurfer/HyperCOM, you will need an adapter from 9-pin serial to 15-pin serial (see &quot;Price&quot;). The manual says that an adapter is included, but I didn't get one. Mhmm..., I had one already anyway.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

What is so special about it? I have no idea! As this is my first experience with an ISDN-TA, I will just cite the manual:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Flash-ROM-Technology
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
There is no software for upgrading the Flash ROM on the Amiga, but it is also possible by using AT commands (by the way, the command is &quot;AT$UPX&quot; - &quot;AT%V&quot; displays the currently installed version). You need a terminal program for this (e.g. Term or NComm).

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">If the standard initialization string in the TCP/IP stack (Genesis, Miami, etc.) is set to &quot;AT&amp;F&amp;D2r&quot;, the Internet Service Provider and the TA negotiate the ISDN protocol (X.75, V.120, HDLC, and whatever else there is) automatically. This is very handy if you don't want to fiddle with all those AT commands. If you are using the Genesis wizard for setting up the connection, you can just select the &quot;Standard modem&quot; and the rest takes care of itself.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">This should work with Miami in a similar way.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

Pfff?? I have no idea what this is for, but nice that you can use them, ain't it? ;).

<P>
You can access Elsa's webpages 24 hours a day. Now Elsa is running out of claims, I think :)). The support line is open Mo-Fr from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. But I haven't had to call them yet.

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">6 years!? That's almost arrogant! Is there still a need for an ISDN-TA in 6 years from now?&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">We will see! There's also a 100 days replacement warranty - so if the TA should break in the first 100 days, it is replaced with a new device.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P><B>Installation</B></P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I had connected my Amiga to an &quot;Elsa Microlink 56k basic&quot; before, and all standard Internet software was already installed, so I wouldn't want to call it an installation - not even &quot;Plug &amp; Play&quot; would describe it correctly. I just disconnected my old modem and connected the TA. Then all plugs into the appropriate sockets and here we go. The TCP/IP programs available on the Amiga have no problems with using this hardware. If it isn't listed, just pick the Generic- or Standard Modem. Only if you want to use some special feature of the TA will you have to consult the manual with the AT commands. If you want/have to configure the TA perfectly, you should get a decent Terminal program from Aminet.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P><B>Documentation:</B></P>
<P>
On the included CD-ROM &quot;MicroLink ISDN Internet&quot;, you can find documentation of the AT commands, a general introduction to ISDN and the printed manual in digital form in the directory &quot;Manual&quot;. The PDF documents can be viewed and printed with &quot;APDF&quot;. Because there is no configuration software for the Amiga, you should carefully read the AT-manual to get the most out of the TA. This manual is understandable and also suitable for beginners. But it also contains some mistakes (particularly the page references which are sometimes wrong), so watch out.
</P>
<P><B>Operation on the Amiga:</B></P>
<P>
I'm using the device on an Amiga 1200 with Blizzard 1230/4 and a Silversurfer interface card. The device driver is a quite new beta version, &quot;hyperCOM1.device 2.96beta1&quot;, which also supports the Silversurfer hardware.
</P>
<P>
Okay, the TA is connected, the computer has booted, Genesis and YAM are waiting for my commands. So I flick the (somewhat small) power switch and the Power-LED of the TA glows green. Now let's see what Genesis says. So I carefully click on &quot;Connect&quot; and start to wait. Huh? Wait? Genesis is already online!!! Now that was fast. No screeching and squeaking as with analog modems. Great!
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Genesis.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Genesis.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="75" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Now what about YAM? I was taken aback when YAM showed me my mailbox. 900 mails were waiting to be downloaded and read. And I had thought I had unsubscribed from all mailing lists. Seems like I forgot some. But who cares - we have ISDN now, don't we? ;)
YAM downloads the mails at an average speed of more than 5000 Bytes/second. Bigger mails with binary attachments even top at 7000 Bytes/second and more (my best result ever was about 7220 cps ;). And that at 64KBit/sec (without combining channels)!
</P>

<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I think about the problems I had with my analog modem: The highest possible speed with my provider was 48KBit/sec (often less than that), and it took between a half and one full minute to establish a connection, depending on the time of the day. Not to mention the weird noises my modem produced on those occasions. Now I get 64Kbit/sec, no matter what time it is. And of course the transfer runs with 64KBit/sec in &quot;both&quot; directions, up- and download.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
But you are not safe from overloaded lines or &quot;inactivity&quot; with ISDN. However, a new connection is established within seconds. The connection time can be minimized if you know the ISDN protocol (B-channel protocol) of your provider (Genesis displays it for a moment after going online). In the TA's standard configuration, it tries to establish the connection with X.75, then with V.120 and finally the HDLCP protocol. It takes less time when the TA uses the correct protocol at the very beginning. You can find information on how to reconfigure the modem accordingly in the AT-command manual, (under &quot;$IBP&quot;, page 9).
</P>
<P>
Downloading with FTP or Amster (Napster) is on average one third faster than with a 56k modem. Download rates of 7KBytes/second are common with compressed archives. Uncompressed files (especially texts) can be twice as fast thanks to hardware compression.

</P>
<P>
When surfing the Web with a browser, my slow 030 lowers the speed drastically, so there is no noticeable acceleration. But I think it's nothing new that surfing is more fun with an 060 and a graphics board.

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I was really amazed by how easy it was to use this TA on the Amiga. Amiga users looking for an external ISDN-TA should take a look at this device. The usage is no harder than with any analog modem. The design is well done, the price and the product quality are convincing. The only problem I encountered was combining channels. If you manage to get this to work, please write me (or to the AMIGA-aktuell forum). The only other thing to criticize is the tiny power switch at the back. Besides that, the &quot;Elsa Microlink ISDN Internet&quot; is a splendid piece of technology.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
