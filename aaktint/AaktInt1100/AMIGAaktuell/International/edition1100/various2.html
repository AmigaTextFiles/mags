<H3>25. October 2000: AmigaOS 3.9 announced</H3>
<P>
It was certainly surprising for many of you that Amiga Inc. announced not
only new details of the AmigaONE but also a new AmigaOS for the current
Amigas at this year's ACE 2000 in Australia. As it was with OS 3.5 the
AmigaOS 3.9 will also be developed by H&amp;P. More details will be available
very soon.

<H3>25. October 2000: We are already 5</H3>
<P>
No - not 5 people, but our company H&amp;P is already 5 years of age. Even for
us it is sometimes hard to believe that it was already 5 years ago when
Jochen Becher, J&uuml;rgen Haage and Markus Nerding said &quot;Yes&quot; at the notary to
start this business ;-) We want to thank all those people out there that
supported us during this time. It was really a pleasure for us :)

<H3>25. October 2000: ArtEffect workshop for download</H3>

ArtEffect is now available as an archive for download.<BR>
