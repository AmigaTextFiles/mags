<P>
36 Readers participated at our last competition.
</P>
<P>
Please join in again this time - you can win with just two answers.
</P>
<P><B>But now, the solution:</B></P>
<P>
Standard question: Which German Amiga Software manufacturer has recently acquired the rights to the programs STFax and Genesis?
</P>
<P>Solution: Haage &amp; Partner</P>
<P>
Master Question: The company asked for in the previous question has its headquarters in Glashuetten. But until approx. two years ago it was situated in another place. Where?
</P>
<P>
Solution: Formerly the headquarters of Haage &amp; Partner were in D 61191 Rosbach v.d.H.
</P>
<P>
Question of opinion: Amiga Vice President Petro Tyschtschenko recently founded an enterprise of his own. Do you feel that now he is in managing two companies he should withdraw from one of them?
</P>
<P><B>The result:</B></P>

<P>
One participant could not make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
Several contributors elaborated their answers:
</P>
<P>
Uwe Eichhorn has no objections to a second job for Petro Tyschtschenko: &raquo;Petro is due the &quot;privilege&quot; of creating another position for the time after sale of the last Amiga Classics or for the failure of the AMIGA-ONE project (buying-up of the sponsors of the project by Microsoft). Sorry, but I feel blue!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Ralph Moser makes a restriction: &raquo;Let him manage two companies, as long as his duties at AMIGA do not suffer.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Dirk Wachtel cannot see a problem: &raquo;You cannot be a servant of two masters (=enterprises), but in this case I assume that Petro knows very well his duties and responsibilities at AMIGA and will not be unsuccessful (hopefully!) in the future.
After all he cannot leave the drowning ship, for it is already aground in the deep sea depression of the Marians ...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Busse had a bet each way: &raquo;1, if it is true (according to his statement), that he only is a sleeping partner. 2, if he is actively engaged in this enterprise and cannot fulfil his contractual obligations to AMIGA, Inc.
</P>
<P>
Wolf Zimmer has no qualms: &raquo;Why should not Petro keep on the safe side? For six long years there were officially only lies and procrastination by AMIGA. And if our Bundeskanzler (title of German Prime Minister) is entitled to hold positions on the supervisory boards of a big Automobile Group in Niedersachsen (Lower Saxonia: country of Fed. Rep. of Germany) and a nuclear power company, because, it is said, there are no conflicts of interest, why shouldn't Petro take a punt on the future?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Fritz Trampnau votes for answer 2 and furthermore writes: &raquo;It is hard to say how the actual situation of AMIGA is to be assessed! What do we expect? Again a long convalescence in the hospital &quot;AMIGA&quot;. The &quot;patient&quot; still is in the intensive care unit. Condition: still critical.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A new cardio-pulmonary machine has been provided and a new team of doctors tries despairingly to keep the prostrate genius alive! Danger especially comes from outside: The &quot;Empire($)&quot; and its &quot;Allies&quot; of course are not interested in the least in the recovery of the invalid, because then the world would find out how simple and good computers can be - how easy they are to serve. But let's wait and see - the juggernaut will not live forever!&laquo;&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>
Dirk Neubauer has a quite cool view of the matter: &raquo;Everybody must work out for himself where and how much he wants to work. If Petro T. founds his own company, then this is his business. He carries the risks. If he believes he is not utilized fully with his job at AMIGA and could take on another burden, then he must have a reason. Maybe he just wants to have an additional support ...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Similarly judges Guido Bruns: &raquo;Everybody makes his own choices, and if Petro believes he has to do something, who of us has the right to tell him not to.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
For Denis Zwornarz the question is of no concern: &raquo;I really don't care. Or did I miss something latterly that he 'did' for the AMIGA? I remember only lots of words but few actions.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andreas Wolf views the second job as a consistent action: &raquo;Everybody knows about the attitude of Petro concerning the plans of AMIGA Inc. So it is only a logical conclusion that he is looking for an alternative.
What will happen when all the remaining old AMIGA hardware stock is used up is logical as well.&laquo;

<P>
Gernod Schomberg asks: &laquo;Is he really a manager &quot;in chief&quot; at AMIGA? He has a good track record with the Amiga. Possibly without him we would never have managed the transition from one broken company to the other. Somehow he has always held together some substantial properties which other interested parties were keen to buy.
But was he really more than an executor of the assets? Isn't he now, while more information-technicians are immigrating (in Germany), about to create a new future for himself? Quite possibly he may speak in favour of our system while following those plans!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Tacke votes for answer 2, but adds: &raquo;Well, in fact I rather
had voted at question 3 with 1.5, because, honestly, it is all the same for me, if he might stay a sleeping partner at this &quot;Power Service&quot; agency, but at AMIGA continues as managing director.&laquo;

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A clear majority has no objection to AMIGA Vice President Petro Tyschtschenko working in two companies simultaneously.
