<P><B>ACSYS</B></P>
<P>
For a long time the programmers of Unique have been working on the Turrican clone ACSYS. The game with the unusual name attracted widespread attention several times with published screenshots. This month a playable demo version has been published. I played this demo version and I was enthusiastic about it.
ACSYS is beautifully made, the game is as good as Turrican. ACSYS plays smoothly, the Hero has many special moves, just like Turrican.
</P>
<P>
The graphics are quite good and smooth. One thing ACSYS doesn't do as good as Turrican: the music. In my opinion there is no better soundtrack than Chris H&uuml;lsbeck´'s Turrican soundtrack. But the music is not the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately it is not quite certain when ACSYS will be published. Since the developers want to be sure that the game will be bought there have to be at least 500 orders from customers who are prepared to pay 59 DM (approx. 30 Euro) for
the game. So let us hope that there will be enough, it surely would be a bonus for the Amiga market.

<H3>Comparison of Exodus and Earth 2140 (by Robert Schwandner)</H3>
<P>
<B>Exodus - The Last War</B>
</P>
<P>
I had already played the first demo and I noticed the outstanding intelligence (?) of the opponents and of my units. After an attack by the opponents is repulsed, my units move after them up to the range of fire of the next opponent units or the tower of defence. In the new demo there are some new units, e.g. a bridgebuilder, but when it is built it is impossible to dismantle or destroy it. The game is made with care and flair but sometimes they made it too good.
</P>
<P>
Colorful graphics might be good (a matter of opinion), but sometimes it is difficult to distinguish your own units from the opponent's in a battle.
</P>
<P>
In my opinion the scenery it too colorful. Sometimes the mouse handling changes, which is not so good, too.
</P>
<P><B>Earth 2140</B></P>
<P>
After playing the 4 demo levels, which are not difficult, I can sum up my reactions:
The opponents in Exodus attack, but those in Earth 2140 just wait. In one level with 3 HQs, it was easy to destroy them or take them over. The fog was, in theory, better than in Napalm. After leaving explored ground, what you can see is limited there. You cannot see any new opponent units.
One thing is curious, you can come under attack from units out of sight and your own units shoot back without seeing the opponent. How can one handle strategy under those circumstances?
</P>
<P>
The graphics are quite good - when you have get used to green units on a green background.
</P>
<P>
The graphic effects of explosions, laser and rocket shots are better than in Napalm, but for this game you wont need a graphics board. Going by the number of colors the game could run in 8 bit. Napalm runs on my Amiga in NTSC highres interlaced without any problems. BUT, I forgot something. This game is originally a Windoze game, this may be the reason.

<P>
If there are no changes in the full version I don´'t see any reason to buy a copy. Although I like this genre I´'m not prepared to waste my money. I would prefer to wait for the definitive best real time strategy game.
</P>
<P>
Come on, Napalm 2.
