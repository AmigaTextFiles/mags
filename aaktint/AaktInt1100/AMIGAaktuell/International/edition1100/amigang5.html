<H2>5. Petro Tyschtschenko retires</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Dear Friends, Colleagues and Fellow Amigans,</B></P>
<P>
It is with a heavy heart that I am sad to announce my coming retirement
from the Amiga community. As you all undoubtedly know, I have been a loyal
promoter of the Amiga platform for nearly twenty years since it was first
broadly introduced by Commodore in the early 1980s. Later through the
difficult years with Commodore and Escom I worked tirelessly with many of
you to 'Keep The Dream Alive.' Now as the new Millennium has dawned, it is
time for some of us older Amigans to pass the torch on to those who still
have the vigor to take Amiga onward.
</P>
<P>
With these fond memories foremost in my mind, the time has nevertheless
come for me to fade from the scene. Effective at the end of this year we
will close all operations and offices in Germany. By then I expect our
stock of finished goods will be nearly gone. I will continue to finalize
the details of the closure through the end of March next year. I will also
continue to your efforts in whatever way I can, consistent with my
retirement. I hope all of you can find it in your hearts to wish me well.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time please address your questions and concerns to Bill McEwen
and his staff in America. I remain confident in their commitment to
realize the continued aspirations of Amigans everywhere.
</P>
