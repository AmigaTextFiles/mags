<H2>2. Operating System? - Who gives a rat's! (by Dirk Wenk)</H2>
<P>
Most web users will reply with these words or similar if you ask them about different operating systems and why they never give them a try.
</P>
<P>
Well, in a way I can understand those people.
</P>
<P>
What does anyone need for the web? A browser, which is able to display any page, an e-mail program and something for chatting. All available under Windblows, MacOS or Linux.
</P>
<P>
The browsers of other operating systems are not quite in the same league - unfortunately this applies to our Amiga, too.
</P>
<P>
For most people a Dreamcast would do the job! Console, keyboard and mouse costing less than 500 DM (appr. 250 Euro). But the software is anything but appropriate for surfing (I'm thinking of the 1.0 browser, the 2.0 is said to be better).
</P>
<P>
There remains only a PC, Mac or a computer with Linux installed. (Linux? Because there are quite good browsers for this OS.)
</P>
<P>
The operating system makes a difference! Anyone surfing with an Amiga will notice a difference compared to the Win PC - you do not have full functionality and you hit web sites which you cannot read with their installations of Javascript &amp; Cie. OK, on your 060 you can surf faster and more comfortably than on a 500MHz Intel crutch.
</P>
<P>
The new Amiga might just come to the rescue - if the new software is stunning enough, and can be installed on a Dreamcast, PSX2, X-Box (he he he) or a Game Cube, and lets you surf etc. without gazing grudgingly upon the possibilities of the big PCs!
</P>
<P>
And there seem to be enough games there for those idle moments...;)
</P>
<P><B>And the future?</B></P>
<P>
The trend will be &quot;Mobile Computing&quot;! No one will want to have a computer on or under the table anymore, where a processor tinkers along, eats electric power, and replaces the radiator in the room!
</P>
<P>
In a future not too far away we will all carry a mobile webpad which will get us on the web anywhere and anytime. We won't need a big desktop PC anymore, because this little gadget can do everything!
</P>
<P>
The latest programs, games and tools will be pulled off the net. Of course we'll need fast access - unfortunately we are on the wrong tack at the moment. More and more flatrates die away ... That much is still in the future of the internet in Germany ... :-\
</P>
<P>
But that's the future, and right now you have no choice but to install Linux on your Amiga to be able to surf reasonably. Luckily I have another Amiga on the network, otherwise disaster would not be far away ;)
</P>
<P>
What do you think about all that? What will the computers of the future look like? More about that as well in my next article ;)
