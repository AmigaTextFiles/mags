<H2>1. First new Executive Update from AMIGA's president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;September 28, 2000</B></P>
<H3>Executive Update</H3>
<P>
Greetings to one and all.
</P>
<P>
I know it has been a long time since I last had the chance to write to all of you.
</P>
<P>
It has been very, very busy, and we have seen some great successes, and
some disappointments.I have not been asleep, and to the contrary I have
not been getting much sleep of late. There is so much activity, and so
little time that I have been spending a great deal of time in other areas
and not keeping everyone up to date.
</P>
<P>
To my Friends in Italy, I apologize that I was not able to attend the show.
It was a real disappointment for me personally, as I wanted to greet each
and every one of you. The reason was not because we are broke, or out of
money as the rumors would state.
</P>
<P>
Simply, there were two companies in California that I have been working
with, and they requested a meeting that occurred over the same period of
time. With working with these OEM's we will be able to add several
million more Amigans, and the discussions went well and are progressing
quickly, these meetings were in addition to what is mentioned in point 3
below.
</P>
<P><B>Here we go:</B></P>
<H3>1. The SDK for Amiga DE</H3>
<P>
This has been very exciting, and we are really pleased with the number of
applications and the number developers using the product to create some
great products.
</P>
<P>
The next version of the Software Development Kit will be out in the next
couple of weeks. In addition to the Linux version there is now a version
available for Windows. That's correct you are now able to develop for the
new Amiga on either Linux, or Windows.
</P>
<P>
It will feature a new raft of multimedia (Mesa, the SSEYO Koan Audio
Engine, streaming) as well better development tools, a richer AVE and
enhanced performance.
</P>
<H3>2. Amiga OS 3.5 and beyond</H3>
<P>
We are continuing taking a very hard look at the current Amiga and how we
can best move the platform forward. There are discussions on going for
some new opportunities and we will be able to share some announcements in
the very near future.
</P>
<H3>3. Amiga DE business opportunities</H3>
<P>
Wow, this is an area that is absolutely exploding. For developers this is
going to be great news. Not only will the applications you are working on
be used by your Amiga family members, but with the deals that are either
executed or in motion there will be millions more consumers joining the
Amiga family.
</P>
<P>
Now many of you began to speculate on the Meternet announcement. Meternet
is offering a great product, and they are going to be making it available
to the Amiga community, but it is not the AmigaOne.
</P>
<H3>4. The AmigaOne</H3>
<P>
We have listened to a great many of you with comments, suggestions,
business ideas and technical ideas. Dean Brown has been a huge help,
especially that he is now here in Snoqualmie with the other members of the
team.
</P>
<P>
Because of this input we have begun negotiations for a brand new design.
Most of the details have been worked out, and I hope to have the finished
announcement ready by the middle of October. It is my firm belief that you
will all be very pleased and excited.
</P>
<H3>5. Dealers/Distributors, and our friends in the Press:</H3>
<P>
The well of information for all of you has been too dry, and inconsistent.
To better provide information to each and every one of you.
</P>
<P>
Amiga has created two new mailing lists. Please go to:
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.amigadev.net/index.php?sid=&amp;subpage=home&amp;function=showmaillists" TARGET="_top">http://www.amigadev.net/index.php?sid=&amp;subpage=home&amp;function=showmaillists</A>
or to <A HREF="http://www.amigadev.com">www.amigadev.com</A> and select mailing lists on the right hand side of
the screen. Select either press or dealer, and fill out your information.
We will begin weekly feeds to these lists to better support our press and
dealers.
</P>
<P>
I know that many of you will read that this letter says nothing, and that
there is nothing happening.
</P>
<P>
Well you are very wrong. We are meeting directly with the heads of some of
the largest computer and consumer electronics companies in the world, and
not only do they see the value in what we are offering but they see where
the Amiga community, you, is the real value.
</P>
<P>
Now we still have a ways to go, but we are moving very fast, and I know
that you will all be very proud of Amiga as we continue to make things
happen.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge for Amiga right now is to stay focused on our core
strengths, and not make the mistakes of those who have walked before us.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga opportunity is huge, and sometimes overwhelming. There are so
many conflicting reports, and I have not done a very good job of being
able to communicate to all of you as well as I would like to.
</P>
<P>
We are getting much closer every day, and everyone of you are a major part
of the Amiga Family's success.
</P>
<P>
