<H2>7.2. New PD games in Aminet - tests (by Malte Mende)</H2>
<H3>Persons in History</H3>
<P>
Everybody thinks it is easiest for a programmer to create a Tetris or PacMan clone. But even easier is a quiz, because this does not need any artificial intelligence, graphics or sounds.
</P>
<P>
This seems to have been the approach of the honorable Mr. Lee Hesselden. In this simple game you have to guess which invention was made by which inventor in what year. This soon gets boring, whether you know the answer or not. For those eager for knowledge there is a small database of inventors and inventions, but this really is small and only in English.
Concerning graphics there is not much to say, and you must do without sound.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore the whole thing runs on an interlaced screen. Your eyes will gratefully cheer when you click upon the 'Quit' button ;-)
Unless you have a flickerfixer ...

<H3>Detris</H3>
<P>
This looks like one of the best Tetris variations for the Amiga. There are, contrary to other clones, many options that can be adjusted - bigger and smaller blocks than in the original game, you can change the size of the playfield and adjust the difficulty.
The difficulty increases during the game (not standard in Tetris clones ...).
</P>
<P>
Another feature only a few clones show: You may play in the (hated by me) B mode, where blocks are in place before the start which have to be deleted as well. You can select how many rows are filled in before, and how many blocks are to be placed in each row.
</P>
<P>
The graphic conversion succeeds quite well, nicely coloured and completely adjustable according to the space you want to occupy on the WB screen. There is no sound, but why not hope for future improvements ;-)
</P>
<P>
For me it is the best Tetris clone existing for the Amiga, only sound and a two-player mode are missing. In every other respect it is just perfect. Download it!

<H3>Bruce Lee</H3>
<P>
Bruce Lee is an old C64 game, now ported to the Amiga. The aim of the game is to collect Amiga balls in jump'n'run levels, while you are walloping a fat sumo wrestler (or getting walloped - it depends ...). This is not really an intelligent gaming idea, and the fun gets lost somewhere, too.
There is a 2 - 4 players mode, which can be quite funny. After all, if you are simply clobbering each other it could become THE party gag of the season. ;-)
</P>
<P>
Graphics and the sound stick closely to the prototype, that means C64 quality.
</P>
<P>
The game is not really good, but anyone who wants to switch off the brain for a while should download it.

<H3>WBsteroids</H3>
<P>
Hey, had there been an Oscar for the best graphics in a WB game, WBsteroids would have won it easily. This little asteroids game for the Workbench puts to rest the old accusation that WB games can't have good graphics.
</P>
<P>
Well, okay, the graphics are not made up from typical WB elements, but it all runs in a system-friendly manner and is freely scalable. All right, scalable in part, because with me the system crashed when trying to decrease the window size ...
</P>
<P>
Everybody knows the principle of the Asteroid game, you have to shoot down asteroids, which get smaller with every hit, until they disappear completely in the depths of space. So you get points and finally you can enter your name into the hiscore list, a dream since childhood for all of us.
</P>
<P>
The graphics consist of &quot;simple&quot; vectors, offering the game a cool feeling. At explosions many little dots fly through space in the direction of the hitting shot. Looks really good! The controls work in the well known space manner (there are no friction forces, you do not stop by yourself), quite complicated, but you get used to it ...
</P>
<P>
There is (as an exception) even sound, you hear a few nice explosion and shot samples and a cool announcement when the game starts.
</P>
<P>
You see, the presentation is absolutely a hit.
</P>
<P>
The game itself is quite motivating, too, but after a longer run it gets a bit monotonous. Several extras, like super-bombs and multi-shots don't do much to reawaken interest.
</P>
<P>
Still, I am sure this is one of the best WB games, the download is absolutely worth the effort. Shouldn't be missing in any collection!
</P>
<P>
Finally: You need a fast computer, with my 030/50 it is quite jerky in the higher levels.

<H3>Schlachtfeld2 (Battlefield2)</H3>
<P>
In a far away future the armies of several colonies fight for resources. Those fights take place on the planet Sonorhc. Not an extraordinary story, but an extraordinary(ily good) game. Schlachtfeld2 looks like the best strategic game based on rounds to be found on the PD market.
</P>
<P>
During battles armoured vehicles and airforces are engaged, supported by maintenance and refuelling units. Every unit can move and fight independently, but ammunition is not unlimited and has to be reloaded. This takes some time.
</P>
<P>
Every unit has its own weaponry, which differentiates in range and power.
</P>
<P>
After hitting an enemy there is a list of exactly what was damaged. A feature of this game is that there are several ways to destroy a tank. The cockpit may be destroyed rendering the unit unusable, or the fuel tank exploded, thereby killing the whole unit. But how a unit is destroyed happens more or less at random.
By the detonation of an armoured car nearby units may be damaged.
</P>
<P>
If you lose a tank you must buy one (or more) new ones. For this purpose you have at the beginning of the battle a certain budget on hand. You should budget carefully with this.

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Even if this game graphically cannot compete with commercial varieties of this genre - it is clearly arranged and the display is easy to understand, but quite unpretentious - the sound is absolutely convincing.

Altogether the game is one of the few where a registration really is well worth it if you find yourself playing it more than just once. Every hobby-general ought to download this game, it really is rewarding!

<H3>BubbleStones</H3>
<P>
After watching 4 to 6 parts of Bust-a-Move being released for different gaming consoles, a resourceful programmer thought over the principle of the game and created a version for Amiga. Not that it is all new, but I must confess the result is quite pleasing.
</P>
<P>
The principle of the game: You have to join at least 3 balls of the same colour. At the upper border of the playfield there are already several balls, and you have to shoot more up there. The shooting angle can freely be selected, the starting position always is the middle of the lower border. If the ball hits the left or right border, it bounces according to the well known rule 'angle of incidence = angle of reflection'.
The level is finished when no more balls are left on the playfield. The longer it takes, the less points you receive. If it takes too long you will receive negative points. This makes it hard to get on the hiscores.
</P>
<P>
The technical conversion has come out quite well, the graphics are - for a game of skill - good, the jolly sound effects contribute to the playing fun, only some music is missing. For the controls you must fish around for your joystick again. Shooting the correct angle is not easy.
</P>
<P>
By the way, the instructions are completely in French. Zut, alors ...
