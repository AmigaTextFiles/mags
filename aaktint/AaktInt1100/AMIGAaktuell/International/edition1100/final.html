<H1>Final thoughts</H1>
<P><B>One more year to wait?</B></P>
<P>
This is the impression conveyed by the announcements about the Amiga during the last weeks, because therein they speak of &quot;Release of products for the final customer in 3rd quarter 2001&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Maybe not everybody has fully understood this: This concerns the stand-alone PowerPC computer, but not the AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
What I mean is this: There is no guarantee that the new Amiga operating system will be released as late as mid/end 2001 in a final version for customers.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who intends to buy an x86-computer or a set-top box will, as I understand it, be able to use the AmigaDE in the first half of the year. But it will take a completely different effort to produce extension boards or a computer based on PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
For an x86, heaps of hardware components are on hand, which usually can be assembled in any configuration. However a PowerPC computer must first be developed, if you do not want to depend on the Apple computers, which cannot be called budget-priced.
</P>
<P>
Because the components on the market are all devised for the x86-architecture, this might lead to major problems with adaptation and therefore to delays in the release, which will not please PowerPC fans. Possibly this is also the reason why you do not hear much any more about the IBM PowerPC boards, which some time ago frequently appeared in the computer media.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga- PowerPC-Balance&laquo; is most revealing, too: In the last years at least six PowerPC extensions for the current Amiga models were announced by several manufacturers, but just one has made it to the market: PowerUp by Phase 5.
</P>
<P>
Therefore I'm not fully confident that the products planned by Eyetech really will be released. Even if they are, there arises one very important question: Will they be able to use the AmigaDE better than a real&laquo; computer, whether it is based on a PowerPC or an x86?
</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I don't believe so - rather the contrary. But let's wait and see and hope to be surprised. Because ahead of the AmigaDE an update - certainly the very last one - of the Classic Amiga OS is to be released. According to announcements on Amiga Future you will be able to get AmigaOS 3.9 at the Amiga Trade Fair in Koeln [Cologne, Germany] planned in December by Haage &amp; Partner.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I wonder where they got this assurance from. After all we know all too well about the possibilities of delays in software development and furthermore not long ago they talked about a free of charge (first of all bugfixed) update (&raquo;BoingBag 2&laquo;). So we'll have to wait and see if the features of the OS 3.9 really will make up for its price.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

<P>
But nevertheless, the last weeks have shown us: We are on the move...

<P>
See you next month.
