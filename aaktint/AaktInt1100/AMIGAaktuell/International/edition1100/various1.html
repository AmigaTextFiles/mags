<H2>1. Report of Amiga Users Meeting in Goettingen/Germany (by Andreas Volkmann)</H2>
<P>
Basically we all were quite content with the users meeting. The goals we had set for ourselves were met except for the expected surge of registrations.
</P>
<P>
The first guest appeared already at about 10.30. The Network connection was established on Saturday in a very short time, so visitors could quickly perceive the advantages of a dedicated line. Because we had several network boards, we were able to connect computers to the net, even if owners hadn't any network experience.
There was much interest in the installation and servicing of Linux on the Amiga. Unfortunately all did not go smoothly: the connection of the X-Surf (Cross-Surf) to computers running Linux and Apple systems did not work for the whole meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed in final discussion about this Amiga Users Meeting of Goettingen that we would hold another meeting like this next year.
