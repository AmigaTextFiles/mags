<H2>4. Software test report: Multi function tool &raquo;Easys&laquo; (by Robert Schwandner)</H2>
<P>
I've been using Easys, or Marina as it was called in the beginning, for two years now. During all this time I have never had any problems in connection with other programs.
</P>
<P>
The installation took about 20 minutes on my 060 system - very long time for an Amiga installation - because Easys is not just one single program but an extensive system add-on. There were no problems during the installation and it's done in clear steps. The only thing which you should do is read the informative texts on Easys. There's no need for any special knowledge.
Most of the installation can be done by Easys automatically.
You should have at least 20MB of empty space on your harddisk.
</P>
<P>
If you're testing Marina (free on Aminet) don't get frustrated. I was also deterred by the installation but Easys has been improved markedly in this respect.
</P>
<P>
I'll use this report to explain the parts of Easys which I use most frequently. You can find a complete list of features and brief explanations at

</P>

Basically, Easys is a clever compilation of extensive ARexx programs and several tools. The most important (and visible) parts are the toolbar and the vastly enhanced Workbench menu bar. These two things are the most important links to Easys's functions and can be used immediately after the installation.
Besides quick access to the system prefs and the most important programs there are functions which really improve some Workbench functions.
</P>
<P>
As far as I know there's no other program which uses system references for all Amiga functions. For example, changing the language via &quot;Locale&quot; immediately makes every program use the chosen language.
</P>
<P>
With *EasyArc* you can comfortably pack and unpack the most common archive formats (lha, zip, dms, arj, gzip, lzx).
</P>
<P>
The *EasyFiler* is a file manager which has been completely integrated into the Workbench environmemt making other file managers unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Using *EasyView* it's possible to choose a viewer for every file format. If you enter the configuration of programs such as an email client, browser, or archive lister then Easys is a very good central-viewer.
</P>
<P>
*DDconv* also comes along and it's an easy-to-use conversion and manipulating tool for several files (graphics, sound, etc.)
</P>
<P>
With *EasySave* you can give Easys functions to all applications which offer an ARexx port.
</P>
<P>
One thing which I really like is that you can put a path for files into the WBStartup without sacrificing much memory.
</P>
<P>
There have been some minor problems when including new applications but these problems could be solved faster than with any other software that I know.
</P>
