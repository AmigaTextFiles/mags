<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<H3>Time-Lapse to Presence</H3>
<P>
What do autumn and spring have in common?
Correct: Clocks are adjusted for daylight saving time. All except my biological clock, which needs a bit of a nudge from the radio, TV or the internet.
</P>
<P>
Failing that, quite often on a Monday morning on my way to work I glimpse a clock in the Metro station and cannot believe what I see. And if I have only gulped a quick cup of coffee (brewed without aloha) I am insufferable. This &quot;chronologic&quot; confrontation leads to a full day of crossness.
</P>
<P>
Prompting the thought: Why should I have to battle life's little hassles when a piece of silicon could take care of them?! My passport is outdated ... confound it, why did my computer not remind me?! No more coffee in the can ... who expects from me at 6 a.m. to distinguish between the dawn and the black shadow in the bowl?! My shoes are not shone ... must I bother about everything?!
</P>
<P>
This list could be carried on endlessly, but I must not bore our highly esteemed readers or depress myself with all those forgotten things, when I could dare a look at the computer market.
</P>
<P>
Computers are getting smaller, less expensive and more portable. So-called PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) are the latest thing. These small wizards and hecklers (?!) simply are ingenious. You can send e-mails with them, write letters, jot down a note, save dates and, and, and ...
</P>
<P>
This is just what I have wanted for a long time, but I couldn't get one with a Boing-ball on it. And if you're that fussy that you can't stand the bugs of operating systems other than the AmigaOS you have a hard time on this planet. After all, you're quite a rare creature!
</P>
<P>
Am I stuck with a dead platform? Well no, AmigaOS 3.5 is quite new. And at Xmas AOS 3.9 is expected ... but there is no PDA in the Boing-bag. In spite of 15 years of Amiga history...
</P>
<P>
So only the good old scratch pad and the scheduler remain to remind you of the smaller and bigger events of life. But with this old technology, now and then you will need the nerve to shamelessly lie in the face of associates, when they worriedly ask why you are on the job so early.
</P>
<P>
My current answer: &quot;Aaaahhhh yeeaa, I had a special case to complete and wanted to enjoy the peace and quiet of morning in the office.&quot;
</P>
<P>
While emailing AMIGA with my little request: &quot;PLEASE SOLVE MY BIG PROBLEM REALLY FAST!!&quot;
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosper...
