<H2>5. Review: Bubble Heroes</H2>
<P>
Approximately two years ago the first report about &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; appeared. Initially everybody was enthusiastic about the new game, but later on it everything went quiet around this title and even I did not believe that it would be released. But then Crystal Interactive Software took the initiative and arranged with the developers of Arcadia Software to distribute the game. And so it was in my mail box this month....
</P>
<P>
&quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; comes in a typical CD cover with sparse instructions. This might not necessarily be the case for the final version, because I received a test version exclusively made
for the SEAL Amiga Mass. Possibly this is a one-off.
</P>
<P>
Before the game can be started installation is necessary. This is
can be done quite fast manually, unless you are doing a complete installation.
</P>
<P>
You can save the hassle by using the standard Commodore Installer - quite easy and afterwards you find a stylish &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; drawer with icon and everything on your harddisk. Let's start!
</P>
<P>
After double-clicking the &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; icon you have to select
the device for the CD sound output. This ought to be the atapi.device with the relevant unit for most users. After that the game starts with some beautiful intro sequences, which appear surprisingly smooth and colorful. Then you enter the main menu.
</P>
<P>
Here you may select different options, e.g. two-player-mode or configuration of the joystick/joypad. Several settings for the music are possible, too. Once you select &quot;Start&quot;, you have to choose between story mode or championship mode. For the test I selected story mode.
</P>
<P>
Lush animated pictures tell the game's story, which goes like this:
</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">A long time ago there was a planet named Radya, which was ruled by Queen Adora and her three sisters. Suddenly four islands appeared in the sky, which were run by the evil Gonzul, who wanted to dominate Radya. The Adora sisters were locked up on those islands, and the player must save them.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
After that the game starts immediately.
</P>
<P>
The game itself may be likened to good old BreakOut, but &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; offers much better graphics and the environment is completely different. In &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; you shoot with different coloured round objects at similar ones on the playfield. Every time three same colored objects are together they self-destruct. You have to hurry to destroy all objects, because they move downwards and must not touch ground. As soon as all objects are destroyed you automatically enter the next level.
</P>
<P>
Result: Even if the game idea of &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; is quite old, it
is a complete success. The game graphically is sumptuous and may be hard to surpass. In an environment with CD sound and animated in-between-sequences, every game is fun. &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot; can really be recommended and it has held even me for hours in front of the screen.
The only item I would criticize is the price, at DM 89.- (appr.
EURO 45.-) set a bit high.
