<H2>4. Second new Executive Update from AMIGA's president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;October 21, 2000 - Executive Update</B></P>
<P><B>Dear Amiga Family:</B></P>
<P>
I am writing this to you as I am flying back from a wonderful two days in
Melbourne Australia. It was indeed a great delight and pleasure to meet
with all of the wonderful members of the Amiga Family downunder, and I
look forward to the next opportunity of coming down to visit.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I especially want to thank all of the dealers, developers and end users who&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">attended the seminars and the hundreds of you who joined at the dinner.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Amiga truly is a global family, and to many an unknown phenomena. It is the
Amiga Family who has kept this amazing system alive and growing.
</P>
<P>
I would like to take a moment and recognize the efforts of two people
especially who made my stay in Australia a delight, and educational as
well. Jeff Rose, of Unitech the d'Amiga Distributor for Australia and
Basil Flinter the Secretary of the Amiga Down Under Group or A.D.U.G. I
want to thank them both for taking the extra time to help me truly
understand what Australia and New Zealand mean to Amiga, and what Amiga
can do to help our Family downunder. I can say that on the next trip, I
will take the time to visit New Zealand, and say hello.
</P>
<P>
There are many exciting things happening with Amiga, and I wanted to tell
everyone, what the attendees of ACE 2000 learned.
</P>
<P><B>Alrighty then, here we go:</B></P>
<P><B>AmigaOS 3.9</B></P>
<P>
Shipping this Christmas 2000 an upgrade for the AmigaOS! Version 3.9 of the
AmigaOS will be shipping, and ready for your holiday season. AmigaOS 3.9 is
being developed in concert with Haage and Partner GmbH, and a new web site
that will include a feature list, and other bits of information will be
available shortly. OS 3.9 will be available for under $40.00. Watch the
site for more details. In the meantime, here's a screen shot.
</P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">While Amiga is still a Benevolent Dictatorship, and not a democracy or even&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">a republic, we do listen to you, the community, and strive to create&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">products that you would enjoy using, and even (dare I say) purchasing.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">It is because of the community that we are pleased to announce the first in&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">a series of new hardware that has been designed by Amiga, and soon to be&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">manufactured by Amiga OEM partners.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The first in the AmigaONE series of products are the AmigaONE PPC 1200, and
AmigaONE PPC 4000 cards from Eyetech. Available to developers in December
this year, these new products are designed specifically for the Amiga
Community.
</P>
<P>
We also are announcing another partner bPlan GmbH who is also creating a
new AmigaONE PPC based desktop computer. More details will emerge shortly
about bPlan and the products that they will be offering.
</P>
<P>
Please visit the AmigaONE web site to learn more.

<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I would also like to announce new versions of the Amiga SDK.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
AmigaSDK version 1.1 will begin shipping on October 24, 2000. In addition
to an upgrade for the Linux version, we are please to announce the Windows
version of the Amiga SDK.
</P>
<P>
Now I made a mistake in the September 28 Executive Update. Amiga SDK 1.1
does not include the sound, UI, or 3D pieces. These will be found in
version 1.2, will be out shortly. I am sorry for the error, but know that
any purchaser of an Amiga SDK will receive free updates, and upgrades for
12 months from the date of purchase.
</P>
<P><B>Possible Amiga Community Investment Opportunity:</B></P>
<P>
Another announcement made in Melbourne was the possibility of a
Registration A filing for Amiga. Since the announcements of the Amiga,
Incorporated plan and strategy we have continually received questions, and
offers of investing in Amiga.
</P>
<P>
We at Amiga have been trying to find ways to give something back for all of
your efforts, and continued faith in what we are doing. We are
investigating a method where we can offer 10% of Amiga to the community in
a Registration A filing.
</P>
<P>
Now as with any investment there is risk associated, and before anyone
should invest we will of course encourage people to read the plan,
prospectus, and risks.
</P>
<P>
We are investigating this in earnest, but before we continue down this path
much further, we wanted to see what the community thought. We have
established an e-mail address of <A HREF="mailto:investor@amiga.com">investor@amiga.com</A> where members of the
Amiga community can send us a message with their interest. We are looking
for no less than $250.00 per investment. If you are interested please send
an e-mail message along with the dollar amount that you would be interested
in investing.
</P>
<P>
We have not decided on whether or not we are going to do this, but to date
we have investigated many opportunities and this looks to be a great
option.
</P>
<P>
Now each country has its own rules about Registration A filings, so you
would want to check with local authorities to learn what rules may apply
to each of you.
</P>
<P><B>Closing:</B></P>
<P>
It has been an amazing 10 months since we started Amiga Incorporated. The
community has seen the delivery of the Amiga SDK, an upgrade, and an
upgrade to the AmigaOS, and now the announcement of three PPC based
AmigaONE products.
</P>
<P>
Well, we have a long ways to go, and many more battles to fight, but I am
confident that with the community with us, and the continuing enhancements
to the product line that there is a long and exciting future for Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Again thanks to Greg, and Michael, and the thousands of other Amigans
downunder who made ACE 2000 such a great event.
</P>
<P>
To the user group members around the world, it is time to start calling the
others who have drifted away, and let them know what is happening, and that
they can be part of continuing the legacy that is Amiga.
</P>
