<H2>3. CD-ROM test report: &raquo;Digital Make Up&laquo; (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P>
634 MB Makeup for the Amiga
</P>
<P>
Even though you might think that with AmigaOS 3.0, 3.1 or even 3.5 you have a complete and for most purposes a suitable operating system (as the advertising suggests), sooner or later you start to want more. To do certain jobs more effectively; because you have just purchased a new piece of hardware; or just because you want more colors and diversity on the Workbench.
</P>
<P>
This new CD-ROM from APC &amp; TCP [1] promises to fulfil all these wishes for 29,95 DM (~15 Euro). Called &quot;Digital Make Up&quot; it is not meant solely for female Amiga users. The publisher says it is meant to be a wardrobe for the Workbench. And a well filled wardrobe it is, containing about 634 MB of data.
</P>
<H3>1. System requirements</H3>
<P>
Before we start looking inside the drawers, everyone interested should get themselves an Amiga with at least a 68020 processor, 2 MB Chip-RAM on board, and of course a hard disk and a CD-ROM drive. The operating system must be at least version 2.05.
For more comfortable working, the publisher recommends a 68040 processor, yes even a PPC CPU, 4 MB of Fast-RAM, the AGA chipset or a graphics board, as well as a sound card and AmigaOS 3.5
</P>
<H3>2. The CD-ROM-Surface</H3>
<P>
... is made of poly-carbonate and a silvery layer of aluminum. :) [*]<BR>
On the Workbench, the CD-ROM presents itself in a very cleaned-up AmigaOS 3.5-style.
</P>

<P>
The &quot;Info&quot; icon tells a few things about the intentions of the creators and gives a very rough overview of the categories in German as well as in English. If you decide to try the icon plus loudspeaker: Be warned! My computer was promptly and reproducibly visited by the Guru. If you take a look at the belonging script (which is hidden by using blanks), you see that it seems to try to play some anims and show some pictures through VT (ViewTek). Since the computer crashes when running VT, this seems to hint that the VT version included can't cope with CyberGFX. But this does not really fit with the recommendation of a graphics board. And there are surely newer anim-players than VT from the year 1994...
</P>
<P>
The &quot;Quickstart&quot; icon creates some temporary assigns for certain directories on the CD to integrate it into the AmigaOS that is running. This makes sense if you have no other tools installed than the ones used on the CD for displaying texts, animations or playing sounds. As expected, the icon &quot;Quickout&quot; removes these assigns. There is no guide to the contents of the CD.
</P>
<P>
But that is not really a problem, since the data has been organized in a quite logical way and so you usually find quickly what you are looking for. A useful tool for browsing would be a file manager.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiOpusList.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiOpusList.jpg" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
If you don't have one, you find the GPL version of Directory Opus 4.14 included, and that takes you directly to the contents.
</P>
<H3>3. CD-ROM-Contents</H3>
<P>
So let's take a little walk through the directories of the CD.
</P>
<P>
The drawer &quot;Workbench Tools&quot;, 155 MB big, contains not only virus scanners, archivers, degraders, converters, boot-tools... but also an OS3.5 drawer with the &quot;BoingBag_1&quot; update and other programs related to OS3.5.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiOS35.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiOS35.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="64" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The 57 MB of the &quot;Tools&quot; directory is filled with many new and old programs, from aNapster to ToolManager to Zoom; in any case mostly useful programs.
</P>
<P>
Blankers, commodities, Datatypes and libraries are waiting inside &quot;Workbench Add On&quot; (47 MB). As well, it contains the aforementioned GPL-DOpus 4.14 and some patches and upgrades for several programs like AWeb 3.3, PFS3, Photogenics, Protracker 4 and Wordworth 7.01.
</P>
<P>
How about a quick game? &quot;Workbench Games&quot; contains 4 MB of system-friendly games that can be played on the Workbench.
</P>
<P>
In &quot;System Tools&quot; (8 MB), you can find such pearls as KingCON, Scout, SnoopDOS, SCSIMounter and VBRControl. Although SnoopDOS and AmiCDFS2 appear twice, there aren't too many other duplicates.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiSysTools.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiSysTools.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="42" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Bootpic and background fans will enjoy &quot;GrafX&quot;. You could spend several days looking through 183 MB of data. And for the next few years, you can a new bootpic each day... But don't open the &quot;Bootpictures&quot; directory from the Workbench, or your standard Amiga will run out of Chip RAM and therefore out of breath because of the innumerable (okay, that's a lie, there are 552) info files. The computer is certain to freeze. You should only troll this directory with a file manager.
Of course, this directory contains the obligatory SciFi pictures.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiGrafX.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiGrafX.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="52" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Besides many icons in NewIcon and MagicWB style, the drawer &quot;Icons&quot; (with 19 MB) also contains the NewIcon system including the update to version 4.6. In my opinion, the best icon system beside GlowIcons.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;Hardware&quot; drawer does not contain a couple of squashed cards (as you might expect), but 32 MB of software in the form of hardware drivers - ranging from printers to sound, scanner, graphics drivers and drivers for digital cameras.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiHardware.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiHardware.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="86" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Noisemakers, Audiophiles and OctaMED fans get a lot of food in the 61 MB &quot;Sounds&quot; directory. But the quality is very mixed. It contains everything from plain fare to fast food to inedible.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/DigiSounds.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DigiSounds.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="42" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The directory &quot;Fun&quot;, luckily only one MB big, holds a lot of superfluous gimmickry, like Tamagotchis.
</P>
<P>
If you add up all these MBytes, you will surely miss some of the CD's capacity. Those missing MB are hiding inside drawers not visible from Workbench, like C:, L:, Libs: ...
</P>
<H3>4. Result</H3>
<P>
This well filled CD-ROM contains a lot of useful system expansion that can make work with the AmigaOS more comfortable and pleasant. Unfortunately, you are mostly left on your own with this huge amount of data. For novice users, some sort of guide would be a good idea (the &quot;professional&quot; will already have the most important tools). If you still don't have access to the Internet and no Aminet CDs, this CD-ROM is recommendable in spite of the odd tiny weak spots here and there, even though the price of 29,95 DM seems a little much for an uncommented data collection.
