<H2>5. Software test report: MPEG player &raquo;Frogger&laquo; v1.6 (by Klaus Moddemann)</H2>
<P>
You can find the Frogger archive (about 866 KByte) on Aminet in gfx/show. Installing it is pretty simple: just unpack the archive, copy frog.library to LIBS: and copy Frogger's directory anywhere it suits your system. Done.
</P>
<P>
System requirements: Frogger basically runs on any Amiga (and also on Linux systems) and requires at least 4 (better 8) MByte of RAM.
</P>
<P>
Additionally you need some programs which can be found on Aminet or on the AmiNET CD-ROMs. For sound you have to install AHI version v4 or better. Unfortunately, there's a mistake in the installer script: in line 1927 there's a command which the installer doesn't know. You can simply remove this line and line 2066. After this modification there shouldn't be any problems.
As well, AHI Frogger makes use of CGX V3 or better.
</P>
<P>
Finally you should get for yourself the ppc.library v46+ from Aminet (if you own a PPC), the mpega.library and some nice MPEG movies.
</P>
<P>
Features: according to the documentation Frogger is able to play MPEG videos of layer 1/2, Audio MPEGs of layer 1/2/3, video sequences from PSX CD-ROMs and video CDs.
</P>
<P>
Frogger can be launched either from Workbench or from CLI - but both ways are equally long winded. When starting from CLI you have to enter a long list of parameters (which have to be set as Tooltypes, too).
You have to specify the MPEG file, sound and picture preferences and you have to (de)activate certain functions.
</P>
<P>
If you click on the icon a small window containing a frog opens on the desktop showing that Frogger has been launched. From then on you control Frogger through a WB menu bar. There are options such as prefs (doesn't work yet), Audio (enable/disable) and an extra menu for PSX CD-ROMs.
Of course, you can also load movie files or exit the program using the menu bar. If you have chosen an MPEG title a window opens on the WB showing the film. In the lower part of the window there are two gadgets for starting and stopping and for loading other files.
Unfortunately, the loading function doesn't work yet. There's a file requester but instead of playing the new movie the old one continues.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the program quits when the film ends. Or, optionally, the program crashes. Probably faulty MPEGs or a bug in AHI should be blamed for that. Conclusion: you should not run any data sensitive programs in the background.
</P>
<P>
Now let's have a look at the program's performance: I'm working with an A4000/040-40 with 64 MBytes of RAM and Cybervision 64 but even with this configuration it's not much fun playing MPEGs. The maximum frame rate that I could achieve was 12.48 fps - the sound reminded me of a whistle. Frogger can be run on any Amiga but do you really want to do that? I suggest an 060 as minimum configuration and sound board as well. Otherwise you'll end up with a nice dia show instead of an MPEG movie.
</P>
<P>
Just one comment on the documentation: It's written in English and partially in Polish and seems to be complete. I just got the impression that the coder cheated with the ToDO list a little bit. ;-)
