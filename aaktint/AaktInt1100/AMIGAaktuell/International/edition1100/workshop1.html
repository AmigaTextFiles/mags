<H2>1. Workshop: Slotting an Amiga into a PC tower (by Klaus Moddemann)</H2>
<P>
Hands up everyone who knows this feeling: You own a desktop A4000 and you keep getting the urge to put all your gear into a nice big tower.
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">I thought about buying a tower from Mikronik or RBM more than once but then decided that DEM 600 was too much for a bigger case and some more slots which I didn't really need.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Last summer I was working for a machine building company and it dawned on me: why not build a tower myself, or adapt a PC tower? So I trotted off and purchased an AT-Bigtower. How hard can this be?
</P>
<P>
Whoa there...just one more thing. Before strapping on this particular bungee harness, read the small print:
</P>
<P>
1. I'm not responsible (nor the translator) for any damage that might occur when you move your Amiga into a tower.
</P>
<P>
2. You'll need parts of your old casing.
</P>
<P>
3. The tower should have enough space to mount the main board about 2 inches above the ground plate. Otherwise you won't be able to screw on your boards (the original German was even more ambiguous - note of the translator) or use your mouse port.
</P>
<P>
4. The switch for the power supply should be next to the 3.5&quot; slots because otherwise the upper 5.25&quot; slot cannot be used.
</P>
<P>
5. The tower should already have an appropriate back for a standard PC power supply unless you have access to a CNC milling cutter, in which case you are only limited by your imagination.
</P>
<P>
If you have all that sussed, pay attention cos now it gets tricky:
</P>
<P>
First to go are all superfluous parts from the tower such as the old mountings for boards. Appropriate tools will come in handy.
</P>
<P>
Then put a piece of U steel into a vice and put the desktop casing on top and secure with another clamp. Detach the part for the power supply and the drive mountings.
</P>
<P>
What I didn't do - but found I should have done - is remove a part of the upright front part up to the point where the mounting for the daughter boards is screwed on. If ya don't, the 3.5&quot; cage cannot be mounted.
</P>
<P>
Now the first &quot;try-on&quot;: I put the old 4000 casing into the tower to see how it fit and to mark the parts that had to be removed from the back. Then saw/grind/drill to make room for the 4000 casing and the new power supply because you'll be lucky if the holes on the casing are positioned correctly to mount the power supply and the casing.
When you have done this, you should get out your rasp and deburr all rough edges or you might shed more blood sweat and tears than are absolutely necessary, or as the author delicately puts it, suffer severe wounds.
</P>
<P>
Now you can position the 4000 casing in the tower and secure it with a couple of clamps. You are now ready to fasten it securely.
</P>
<P>
Screws or welds? Screws have the drawback that they protrude and can inflict more of the severe wounds mentioned above every time you have to open the tower up to add new cards or reseat old ones. Welds on the other hand have to be done accurately or the rest of the computer won't fit. You have to use low voltage and do short tacks or the sheet steel will warp, which looks pretty amateurish and just adds to the problems of getting things to fit. At the same time, some say you should have a fine water spray playing on the sheet steel so that welding splashes don't burn holes. The choice is clear.....
</P>
<P>
You may have to adapt the back plate for a new power supply. The drawing gives the positions to drill the required holes. The measures refer to the edges of the power supply so they are the absolute values I needed. You have to subtract 410mm from the x values and 60mm from the y values to get the measures of the corresponding edges of the power supply.
</P>
<P>
Find the correct positions inside the tower and add the corresponding values in x and y (measured values from the casing's ground to the power supply's edges).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Tower.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Tower.jpg" WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="96" ALT="drawing"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Now, if you need to adapt the back plate, cut a steel sheet that covers the whole back except where the cover is screwed on and then mark the areas which have to be removed and the drillings.
For areas that are rectangular you should first of all drill 8mm holes at the edges and then remove the rest with a hacksaw.
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to use your old power supply you should simply cut off the appropriate part from your desktop casing and screw/weld it on the back of the tower.
Deburr the steel sheet and then fasten it to the tower's back.
</P>
<P>
Now you should clean the tower thoroughly, and enamel the parts that might rust.
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to use a PC-AT power supply as I did, read on carefully! You might think you can find the correct pins by measuring but oh no....5V don't always equal 5V!!! I made the same mistake and nearly toasted my Amiga 4000. The best thing that you can do is open the new power supply and look at the notations on the circuit board. The old power supply's assignments are:

Connect all the cables then you can test your system.

<P><B>Thanks to:</B></P>
<P>
Christian Becker, you urged me to do it myself...
</P>
<P>
Hans-Joerg Kueper for the CNC program, it fits perfectly...
Oskar Sterzenbach for your leniency...
</P>
<P>
And thanks to everybody who I didn't mention but helped me to make this project successful (I know - sounds stupid).
