<P><B>Game's description:</B></P>
<P>
Warcraft II is a realtime strategy game in a fantasy genre where orcs and
humans fight against each other. The player may choose for which party he's
going to lead war.
</P>
<P>
Playing the game is similar for each party: as in other realtime strategy
games is important to build a store first. In 'Warcraft' for this purpose
there are sawmills, farms and churches which all have different functions.
</P>
<P>
In order to erect buildings you nevertheless need several raw materials:
gold, wood and oil. The first two of the ones mentioned can be collected
in mines and forests by simple workers. Furthermore these workers set up
your buildings but one worker can't perform two actions at the same time.
Oil can be found in higher levels and has to be raised by oil rigs and
has to transported to your headquarters by ships.
</P>
<P>
When enough buildings have been erected you can start producing several
different units which have different features and weapons.
</P>
<P>
With these units you can explore the surroundings (black areas are filled)
and, of course, attack the opponents. In the following battles you hit the
opponents with the weapons, until one of the fighters loses his energy.
</P>
<P>
You control everything with a task bar at the border of the screen and
you can't only order movements or attacks but also complex things such
as &quot;patroling&quot; and &quot;hold position&quot; giving the whole game an additional
strategic aspect.
</P>
<P>
A special feature that is unique in &quot;Warcraft&quot; is the so called &quot;Fog of
War&quot; that prevents looking at non visible places. Clearly: a player can
only see movements of the enemy where he has own units that can see the
enemy. Otherwise territory that you already explored is veiled by grey
fog.
</P>
<P>
Graphics and music are pretty good. If you'd like to get an more detailed
impression of the graphics should download the some screenshots from the
AAkt homepage.
</P>
<P><B>Game's speed:</B></P>
<P>
Even without a graphics board the game is suitably fluid. The scrolling
is jerking a little bit, but better than in 'Napalm'. As a conclusion I
can say that 'Warcraft II' can be played very well.
</P>
<P><B>Results:</B></P>
<P>
If you like realtime strategy games you'll be really pleased with
'Warcraft II'. Due to the fact that the game can be played via network
you can join a group with Fusion.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for buying is that you can still purchase the Mac version
in stores because it's on a hybrid CD-ROM. Just look around and you'll
find it.

<H2>Return to Zork</H2>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><PRE>
Name of the game: Return to Zork
Manufacturer    : Infocom
Requirements    : 4MB
Available at    : ?

Basis of testing: ( ) full version      ( ) demo     (X) other: Mac magazine
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>Introduction:</B></P>
<P>
If you can still remember the time when a game impressed simply by its
depth not by its graphics then you probably also remember the firm
Infocom that coded text adventures and among these the Zork series.
"Return to Zork" finally marked the transition to the multimedia age. The
game was given a pompous (for that time) get-up.
</P>
<P><B>Game's description:</B></P>
<P>
The player starts the game at the "Vulture Pass" in the "Valley of the
Sparrows" from where you go to the city "Shanbar" directly. Here you
can get the neccessary equipment for the future adventurous journey into
the underground empires of Zork and you can talk to some obscure persons
that live inthe city: amongst them there's a unmarried teacher, a soak
and the mayor.
You can influence the conversations by showing boredom, indifference or
even hostility. Depending on your mood you can get different information
which you need for further adventures.
</P>
<P>
The whole game is played by mouse. You can use it to move forward or
backward and to turn around and you can drag and drop items. Dragging
and dropping use several menues depending on the context giving you
different options.
</P>
<P>
Nice backdrops and digitized characters give a good graphical impression.
During conversations the player has the joy (?) of video sequences
that limit your interaction, of course.
</P>
<P>
In comparison to the graphics the sound doesn't satisfy and in the article
in the magazine it's describes as &quot;lift music&quot;. Furthermore it criticizes
the strange riddles and the monotonous gameplay.
</P>
<P><B>Game's speed:</B></P>
<P>
A 68030 is probably enough because the system requirements are said to be
a LC or better and the 68030 should be sufficient to play the game. Solely
the video sequences might need some more power.
</P>
<P><B>Results:</B></P>
<P>
&quot;Return to Zork&quot; probably won't earn much enthusiasm especially because
the only positive aspect are the graphics that nowadays are no real
reason for buying. But if you find it anywhere cheaply then it might be
worth purchasing because it comes from the cult company Infocom.
