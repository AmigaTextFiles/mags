<H2>1. AMIGA-Praesident Bill McEwen talks to the users</H2>
<H3>&raquo;EXECUTIVE UPDATE</H3>
<H3>March 10, 2000</H3>
<P>
<B>Dear Friends:</B>
</P><P>
With all of the continuing rumors out there, one would think that we were
gone, or just spending the money that we raised on homes in Hawaii, or
doing nothing.
</P><P>
I can assure you that this is not the case.  As mentioned in the previous
update, if you do not read it here do not believe it.
</P><P>
This months letter is going to be a long one, and I apologize in advance
for the length.  There is a lot of information here so take your time.
</P><P>
Recently I received an e-mail message that brought to my attention a sad
reality.
</P><P>
When Gateway purchased Amiga in 1997 they made many promises, and in fact
there were 6 different product announcements during their tenure.  I was
involved with two of them, QNX, and Linux.
</P><P>
While I believed that we were going to deliver on the two product versions
that I was involved in, they did not materialize, and it has hurt many of
you.  The decisions to change or alter either of these announcements was
not mine, but I was a part of the team that was involved in both.  For this
I am very sorry.
</P><P>
It is because of the reasons mentioned above that I promised not to say
anything or announce anything until it was done, and ready.
</P><P>
I know that this is difficult, especially with the number of great people
and Amiga companies who are feeling the continued strain, but I did not
want to have us all go through any more false starts, and undelivered
dreams.
</P><P>
April 1, 2000 is the date, and St. Louis is the place.  This is the first
opportunity for ``your'' Amiga company to present, demonstrate, speak, and
see the first product to come out of Amiga - The new Developer System.  In
fact one lucky show attendee will win one of these systems.
</P><P>
With all of the above said; Another month, and a great deal of work has
been completed.  Many of you believe nothing is happening, I can assure you
that a great deal has been occurring.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Amiga - ``So the World May KnowTM''.</U></B>
</P><P>
There have been some great new hires, many new partnerships and great
progress as we are moving forward.  There is more information about them
mentioned below.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Partnerships</U></B>
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Tao-Group</B>
</P><P>
The first of course was the announcement with Tao-Group which has been
moving along great.  In St. Louis we will be showing the first round of the
Amiga/Tao system.  There is a great deal of work to be done, but we are far
enough along to launch the new developer system for Tao at the show.
</P><P>
<B>Haage & Partner</B>
</P><P>
We have entered into a long term relationship with H&P that will provide
API's and a path towards to the future OS.  This includes new updated
versions of Storm IDE.  They have also committed to porting all of their
software to the new platform.
</P><P>
We are also excited to work with H&P on a new version of the WarpOS that
will allow the new Amiga to run on PPC accelerator cards.  This means that
an Amiga that has a PPC card running WarpOS will be able to run the new
Amiga on that card!  That's right.  The new Amiga running on the current
A1200s!
</P><P>
More on H&P will become public as we continue to move forward and work
through the testing programs.
</P><P>
We are very excited about this relationship.
</P><P>
<B>Hyperion</B>
</P><P>
Hyperion and Amiga have entered into an agreement for the porting of the
existing and new games to the new Amiga.  This along with the great work
that Ben and his team have done in working on a new 3D gaming engine for
the new Amiga.  They have been working very closely with the Amiga
development team and Tao-Group to make the development of games for the
Amiga a cut above the rest.  We are very pleased to be have them as members
of the new team.
</P><P>
<B>Epic Marketing</B>
</P><P>
Thomas Steiding has been a great supporter from the beginning.  Epic has
announced that not only will they be making their games available on the
new system, but that they have secured the rights for many new games.  More
on Epic with a follow on announcement later.
</P><P>
There are many more partnerships that will be revealed in St. Louis with
even more exciting news.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>E-Mails</B>
</P><P>
Where to start.  I continue to receive hundreds of e-mails everyday, and
while I am not the only one on the team who seems to be living on e-mail,
we have not been able to answer as many as we would like.
</P><P>
We are listening, and working on many of your comments.  Here are some of
your concerns and what we have been doing to help:
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Phase 5 and their recent changes.</B>
</P><P>
We have been in contact with Mr. Thomas Dellert, and Mr. Stefan Domeyer,
and we are working with both DCE, and Met@box to provide solutions for the
Amiga market and we expect some great news soon.  I can say that the
conversations have been going very well, and we look forward to working
towards an exciting future with both of these companies.
</P><P>
One of the key benefits with the relationships that we have been able to
strike with both of these firms is their long term commitment to Amiga.
</P><P>
According to our initial conversations, and project plans we are working to
ensure that the new Amiga will run on both of the PPC boards supplied by
these companies.
</P><P>
We will be providing more detail in product announcements from both firms.
</P><P>
</P><P>
Dealer and distributors have been contacting us about their current
situations and future plans.
</P><P>
In response to the many requests we have created the Amiga Dealer Network,
or ``A D N''.  Randy Hughes our VP of Sales (more about him later) sent out
an e-mail message to over 300 dealers, and the response has been fantastic.
 Many dealers are ready to begin carrying the Amiga again, and more are
very excited about the future.  The A D N is a way for us to better
communicate our plans, hear concerns, and work together to create a
stronger Amiga.  As I am sure that you will see there are great things to
come from the A D N.
</P><P>
Remember that we plan on being able to run the New OS on PPC boards.  Does
your machine support that option?
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Developers and the future development plans.</U></B>
</P><P>
Training sessions at Tao-Group have been continuing for some months now,
and we have a better relationship today than when we started, and we are
more convinced than ever that our decision was the right one.  There will
be opportunity in St. Louis for others to see the Tao-System at work, and
we look forward to seeing all of you there.
</P><P>
We also will be having a developer meeting in St. Louis on March 31st at
7:00pm.  This is a developer only meeting, and we will be giving
information about the hardware, software tools, and the developer support
program.  We know that there is going to great interest in this seminar to
plan ahead and get there early as space is limited.
</P><P>
Please check the St. Louis show site, and the Amiga sites for more
information.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Communication with the Amiga Community.</U></B>
</P><P>
We have contracted with Equinox Design to create the new ``Amiga World''
newsletter.  This will be available for free to all of the Amiga community.
Initially this will be made available via the Internet from our new
website and then (if demand merits) we will make a printed version.  This
is not in anyway in competition with the existing Amiga publications that
currently are in print.  This instead is targeted as a newsletter designed
as a vehicle to help the community communicate better together. The Editor
of Amiga World is Fletcher Haug, the former Editor and Publisher of the
Amiga Informer.  The first edition should be available within the first two
weeks of April.
</P><P>
There are no advertisements, and we are using this as another method to get
information out to all of you, and to help the publications that we have
today.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>More Communications with the Amiga Community.</B>

<B>New Faces on the Team</B>
</P><P>
There are many new people at Amiga, and we are excited about the team that
we are continuing to build.  Below you will find some specific detail on
certain team members, here you will find the names and descriptions of the
folks that I get to work the most closely with.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Randall P. Hughes - VP Sales and Strategic Business Development</U></B>
</P><P>
Randy comes to us after being the VP of Sales at a very exciting Java
technologies company ThinWeb.  Randy and I worked together when he was my
primary contact at QNX.  He is a very skilled person with backgrounds in
Banking, and technology.  Randy understands the Amiga, and what the future
brings.  He has had business dealings with some of the strongest technology
companies in the world.  He was the person that QNX selected to open their
first office in California.  I know that you will enjoy meeting him in St.
Louis.
</P><P>
Now the official comments that will be going up on the web site later;
</P><P>
Mr Hughes comes to Amiga directly >from a Java based start up where he
headed the sales and alliances function >from inception to its filing for
IPO on the NASDAQ exchange.
</P><P>
Randy was initiated to the Amiga community as the lead manager responsible
for the relationship with Amiga during his tenure at QNX where he headed
the expansion to Silicon Valley and into Southern California.
</P><P>
Randy was first and foremost a financier from his days at notable Canadian
financial institutions, namely the Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank.
</P><P>
Randy was educated at the University of Ottawa, Canada and at Marlborough
College in England.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Vincent P. Pfeifer - VP of Operations</U></B>
</P><P>
Vince and I worked together for several years at ConnectSoft.  Vince has an
incredible ability to deliver products.  I have seen him time and again
walk into extremely difficult situations with very hard headed engineers
and stupid marketing people, and deliver amazing products.  I am very
pleased that he has agreed to join us.
</P><P>
Here is his official web site description;
</P><P>
Vince Pfeifer has 14 years experience in the computer industry with the
last 12 spent in the software area.  Vince joins us from GraphOn
Corporation where, as Vice President of Product Development and General
Manager of GraphOn's Seattle based operations, he oversaw all Engineering
resources for GraphOn's multiple development sites.  During his tenure at
GraphOn, sales tripled while product offerings doubled.  Additionally,
Vince helped oversee the merger that made GraphOn a publicly traded company
whose Market Capitalization quadrupled in under a year.
</P><P>
Vince has hands-on experience building and managing software development
operations as well as product management organizations.  Vince has
experience with both startup organizations (ConnectSoft, Exodus
Technologies, GraphOn) as well as more established companies (Symantec).
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Why I joined Amiga, by Vincent P. Pfeifer</B>
</P><P>
Other than the belief that Bill McEwen could sell ice cubes to Eskimos, I
joined Amiga to take on the challenge of turning a company's name and image
that has become somewhat dated here in the United States into a top level,
respected company in the computer industry.  As I am coming off a
successful venture in helping turn GraphOn into a publicly traded company
with record revenues from the position of Vice President of Product
Development, I was ready for a new set of responsibilities in more areas
than Product Management and Engineering.
</P><P>
Amiga offers a challenge that I look forward to: build a company from the
bottom up with the benefit of having name recognition and some technology
already in place.
</P><P>
It is an opportunity to do something that I have wanted to do since my
early days at 5th Generation when I sat on the Tech Support phones and
listened to average users try to use relatively complicated software. I
know that it sounds like a religious crusade, but I want to make computers
easier for the masses, and with my position at Amiga, I have an opportunity
to help influence that vision significantly.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Gary Peake - Director of Developer Relations and Support</B>
</P><P>
My favorite man from Texas.  Gary has already put thousands of hours of his
life to support the Amiga, and the community worldwide.  Now he has joined
our team in delivering his years of experience and affection for the Amiga
in supporting the efforts of the Amiga community.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Tarah Mallo - Reception and Office</B>
</P><P>
Tarah is our first line of communication to the outside world.  She has
been working with the development team gathering information and support.
As well as helping me to get organized.  I will state for the record that
the pictures of the original office were taken ``before'' she joined.  Say
hello to Tarah the next time you call.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Kari Erickson - Executive Administration</B>
</P><P>
Kari is the person who will keep my life and travel plans in order.  She is
who you will get to speak to first before getting me, or any other member
of the executive team.  Kari joins us after leaving one of the very
prestigious law firms here in the Seattle area, and I am sure that you can
already feel her pain in having to deal with me on a day to day basis.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Susan Sutton - Director of Finance and Human Resources</B>
</P><P>
Susan is going to take over the collection of funds, and the paying of
bills.  She is also the person who gets to deal with all of the employee
complaints about Fleecy.  Just kidding there are more complaints about me,
than there are Fleecy.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Gordon Stone - Director of Information Services and Information Technologies</B>
</P><P>
We refer to Gordon as the network man.  Gordon got his start in computing
by upgrading Amiga memory for recording studios in Oregon.  He has since
moved onto operating numerous systems, and is versed in all that is
connectivity.  Gordon actually will start in two weeks, but we wanted to
introduce him now.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Operations in Germany - New Members on our team</U></B>
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Markus Grohmann - Order processing and EDP</B>
</P><P>
Markus already has a family history with Amiga, as his brother used to work
with us in Braunschweig.  We look forward to working with Markus.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Barbara Nitzsche - Executive Assistant to Petro</B>
</P><P>
With the addition of Barbara to our team in Germany we will be able to have
Petro out more.  Next time you call Langen say hello to Barbara and welcome
her to Amiga.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Members of the Development Team</U></B>
</P><P>
<B>Dean Brown</B> - Dean founded DKB weeks after the first A1000 came out and then
spent the next 15 years designing and producing all manner of add ons,
expansion cards and accelerators for the whole range of Amiga computers. He
brings a deep understanding of the spirit and reality of the Amiga
hardware, along with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of current and future
projects. He will use this to help Amiga and its partners create multiple
hardware platforms for the future.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Dave Taylor</B> - Dave is another scouser, from Liverpool, UK, although he
supports the wrong football team. He has spent the last ten years designing
and implementing distributed manufacturing, control, and eCommerce systems
for small, medium, and large companies across the globe, on Mainframe, Unix
and Windows architectures. The last 3 years have seen him concentrating on
distributed systems, databases, and n tier commercial systems. He brings
commercial world experience, eCommerce expertise and formal methods with a
refreshing new look on architecture to the company, and was also brave
enough to try snowboarding with Wouter and myself.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Wouter van Oortmerssen</B> - Wouter is a tall, dutch, quake master currently
completing his doctorate at Southampton University. He has been an Amigan
since the early 1990's and is most well known for the excellent Amiga E
language and compiler that grew from a research project into a professional
system. He is bringing a fresh look at language, conversation and
interaction in the new Amiverse.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Andreas Kleinert</B> - Andreas has worked for the last few years producing
public domain, shareware, and commercial applications for the Amiga, PC and
UNIX markets. For the Amiga market, Andreas concentrated on various
graphics and datatype systems before taking up the challenge of lead
developer for the SuperBase database product line. His deep knowledge of
data storage, retrieval and indexing is core to creating a self describing
and multi dimensional amiverse.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Trond Werner Hansen</B> - Some people are leg men, others are face men. Trond
is most definitely a face man - INTERFACE man 8-) Over the last seven years
he has moved from small programs to enhance workbench, through completely
reimplementing layers.library as SuperLayers, to developing a NG Amiga
workbench system. With configurability and simplicity being central
features for the Amiverse, Trond will be helping to redefine presentation
and participation in digital worlds.

<B><U>More information.</U></B>
</P><P>
We have spending a great deal of time on infrastructure and getting ready
for the next wave.
</P><P>
<B><U>New Building!</U></B>
</P><P>
One of the first problems was in the area of Real Estate, we currently are
in 600 feet with us bulging out the walls, and being located outside of a
car wash has its benefits, but it is still rather annoying with all of the
car stereos going at the same time outside your front door.
</P><P>
We are in the process of moving to our new world headquarters in
Snoqualmie, Washington.  The new address will be:
</P><P>
Amiga Incorporated<BR>
34935 SE Douglas Street<BR>
Suite 210<BR>
Snoqualmie, WA  98065<BR>
USA<BR>
Telephone number  +001 425.396.5660<BR>
Facsimile number +001 425.396.6551<BR>
</P><P>
We officially open the doors and are up and running on March 15th, 2000.
However we will begin moving equipment, phones, servers, etc on Monday
March 13th, 2000.  This means that it may be more difficult to get in touch
with over the next few days.  We apologize in advance for any hardship this
may cause.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>New Web Site!</U></B>
</P><P>
This is one of the number one items on the list, and the largest number of
``comments'' that we receive >from the community.
</P><P>
We have been in process building a new web site for some weeks.  The
difficulty has been server location and time.  We have now addressed both
of these issues and we plan to have a new site up in the next couple of
weeks.
</P><P>
A web site is a constant work in progress, so we look forward to your
comments, and will continue to try and enhance the experience.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B><U>Final thoughts.</U></B>
</P><P>
This letter does not cover all of the activities that are and continue to
take place.  There is so much more happening that I could spend days
writing and still not keep up with it all.
</P><P>
We are extremely busy here, and could not be having more fun.  The company
and the people who have contacted us to support what we are doing have been
in many cases overwhelming.  We have several more partnerships that we are
going to be announcing in St. Louis, and we hope to see as many of you
there as possible.
</P><P>
I recently asked a long time Amigan, and a member of the select team that
worked with Jay directly the reason that Jay started this venture.  I have
heard many ideas as to what Jay ``really'' wanted to do, and many e-mails
inform me that they know what Jay had planned all along.  While I never had
the chance of either meeting, or speaking with Jay I thought I would ask.
</P><P>
Simply stated ``Jay wanted to build the greatest home computing experience
ever, for under 500.00''.  I can tell you that his dream still lives with
every member of this company, and we will deliver on his dream.
</P><P>
I thank each and every one of you for your continued support, and look
forward to the future.
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>Keeping the faith,</B>
