<H2>6. Some hardware and software problems and their solution (by Uwe Mann)</H2>
<P>
</P>
&#187;Uwe's unsolved()  solved(x)  Amiga puzzles<BR>
</P><P>
<B>1) Connection problems with 56K modem</B><BR>
</P><P>
At first I had a Suprafaxx modem 28.8. Then I got a US Robotics 56k Fax<BR>
modem and was quite satisfied with it.<BR>
</P><P>
Starting with Dec 99 all of a sudden problems with the connections arose,
because I didn't receiv more than 300 characters per second (cps) !!!!!
According to the Miami display I had a  40, 42, 44.4 and once even a 49 K
login but in effect no fast connection. Previously I had 2000 to 5000 cps.
I tested all sorts of things and discovered, that in the whole it was
tolerable only with a 33K login (appr. 2000-3000 cps). With all faster
connections it effectively was slower than with the 33K login.
Consequently I handed the modem to "Mediamarkt" for repair.<BR>
</P><P>
It took 6 weeks !!! (Returned to manufacturer.) In the meantime I again
used the 28.8 modem, which was nearly as fast as the 56 K one.<BR>
</P><P>
The Robotics was trashed and I was asked to pick up a new one at<BR>
"Mediamarkt" (and for this they needed 6 weeks!!!!). As usual, they could
not offer the same type and now I have an Acer 56K. (But this one does
not display the connection speed as the Robotics did.) And I had the
same problem!<BR>
</P><P>
Then I had the proper notion. For Christmas we had treated ourselves
with a new (cordless) telephon, the original T Sinus 45 (really good).
I unplugged it from the Telcom line outlet and look at that: it works
like a charm !!!! (up to 6000 cps)<BR>
</P><P>
I mailed my (ex)problem to Olaf Krafft and this is his answer:
(Olaf is member of the TeleCom or the like)<BR>
</P><P>
<kbd>
For the 56K transmission not only different frequencies but as well
different voltage levels are used on the telephon line. At login both
terminals measure the conductors and according to the quality of the
line data rates of 33.6 K to 56 K may be reached. If you connect an
additional equipment in parallel you change the impedance of the line
and this may be the reason for the misbehaviour.<BR>
</P><P>
As a solution an AWADO (Automatische Wand-Anschluss-Dose = Automatic
wall connection socket for TAE system used in Germany) may be useful.
It may be installed as the very first terminal socket and only one of
the connected devices is put through.<BR>
</P><P>
But a simple home exchange is not much more expensive and ought to work
as well. The cheapest solution would be a switch to turn off the Sinus
and the best the change to ISDN :-) There are quite reasonable priced
offers, e.g. the PowerDragon from Hagenuk sold by Conrad for appr.
50 DM.</kbd><BR>
</P><P>
But I discovered another solution. The modem itself has on its backside
a socket for a telephon. Well, in the "T-Punkt" shop they don't have a
cable with two Western plugs. But Conrad offers it really cheap. I
connected the Sinus to the modem and finally everything works without
difficulties, I don't have to pull a plug or have to make any changes
at the telephon socket.<BR>
</P><P>
</P><P>
<B>2) Problems with restore of Diavolo backup files</B><BR>
</P><P>
I made backups with Diavolo and saved them as files. If I wanted to
restore several directories out of the backup Diavolo gurued. Not in
every case, but in 80% of my trials. This did not happen, if I wrote
back single files. The same problem arose, when I had connected the HD to
the A1200 with Blizzard IV. At that time I had not recognized it, because
I didn't have that "big" harddisks and made my backups on floppy disks.
I puzzled around for more than a year, what means, as long as I have the
A4000. Out of a new update of Diavolo I learned the e-mail address of M.
Wenngatz and he advised me as follows:<BR>
</P><P>
<kbd>
The reason is the block size.<BR>
</P><P>
Try to encrease the MaxTransfer for one &lt;f&gt; with help of HDToolBox.
In most cases this helps.</kbd><BR>
</P><P>
I had to play around a bit and because I run the PFS 4.2 I had to
decrease for one &lt;F&gt;. With my configuration now the correct setting is
MaxTransfer: 0x00FFFFFC. I never had thought of this, because anything
else on my Amiga seemed to work all right.
</P><P>
</P><P>
2.1    I burned the backup files onto CD<BR>
</P><P>
With an IDE CDROM drive connected to the internal IDE interface I could
not restore the backups directly from the CD. At first I had to transfer
the backup files to the harddisk.<BR>
</P><P>
With an Overdrive CDROM drive the procedure now works from the CD.<BR>
</P><P>
After I had aquired an A4000 with SCSI ROM drive it worked there directly
>from CD, too. Additionally there I had connected a faster IDE CDROM drive.
Oddly now Diavolo works with an Atapi drive! Even, if the SCSI CDROM drive
is not connected any more! It is completely sufficient, if a SCSI CDROM
drive is mounted. But not, if only the Atapi CDROM drive is installed.<BR>
