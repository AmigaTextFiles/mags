Look, there's a dead fish in the water ...
</P>
<P>
You've got to watch, you don't fall ..... well, you should know the rest.
Currently here are interesting days for the computer world.
</P>
<P>
First, Intel announces a currently not available breakthrough through the 1 GHz wall: But AMD was quicker. Then
AMIGA introduces the sensation of the year, which could be called an early Easter egg. Another some days later
(in this rush you could easily think it's just hours), the new world suprises us with a possible decline of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
The stocks reacted hard and showed, how quickly a bubble can be destroyed. Or has it just been a soap-opera for some years?
In the end the long emotional pain of the Amiga-world was the deathblow for monopolists?
</P>
<P>
Of course, the one or the other of you might think, that this arguments are either very naive or at least exaggerated.
But me, the writer, is all ready, and all of us could gain from a pat on the back. The crew of Amiga really earned our
up-looking thumb.
</P>
<P>
Those of you, who looked into various magazines during the last weeks, might have got the conclusion, that the best is
still coming. The wise decision, to make the new AmigaOS extremely scalable, destroys the market power of the unique
hard- and software manufacturer. Soon, any user (who wants) can get AmigaOS on his favorite platform.
Continouing hardware-shortage, which was present on the Amiga market during the last years, will never ever exist anymore.
Those, who dislike x86 put a G4 resp. Power4 computer on their desk. Those, who think, that this is still too slow, can
run the new AmigaOS on a Sparc cluster.
</P>
<P>
Beautiful, new Amiga world ... damned, where's the problem?! Right ... I knew it ....
</P>
<P>
The vision of the last few Heckler-articles seems to become true, soon. Amiga here ... Amiga there ... Amiga everywhere.
Hopefully Fleecy, Bill or daddy Petro don't come into the same situation as Bill Boy is know. And hopefully I can still
by my Premium bottle within a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosper .... and a real Cheers to St. Louis !!

PS: Because no one has been interested in my favorite supermarket-bottle I virtually (in my mind) bought any bottle within
the whole republic (Remark of the Editor: Federal Repulic of Germany). And the brand will be my secret ...
See!
