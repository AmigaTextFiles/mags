many features like an electronic notepad or statistic functions, which e.g. log the daily computer run time. (Supports MUI)&laquo;

<P>
Andre Schenk gave his program Kniffel for the competition to us
</P>
<BR>
&raquo;Kniffel might be one of the favorite dice game. There are various ports, but none of them could satisfy my wishes.
<P>
My parents like this game so much, that I decided to give them a Kniffel program as a present I wrote myself, shortly
before christmas 1993.
</P>
<P>
After the program has proven its worth in &quot;daily use&quot; I would like to give it to others. When programming the
game I did it without much useless rubbish as playing against computer opponents or sound support, but attached great
value on stability and following the guidelines of Commodore. How much I was successful in this matter you have to find
out yourself.
</P>
<P>
The program was completely developped in &quot;Amiga Oberon&quot;.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Furthermore Thomas Hasemann gave a 3x-CD-ROM-drive (SCSI) from NEC incl. two caddies to us.
</P>
<P>
Our thanks goes to all donators!
