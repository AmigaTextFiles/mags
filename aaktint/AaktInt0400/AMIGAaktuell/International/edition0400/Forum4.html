<H2>4. How to write an article for &quot;Amiga aktuell International&quot;? (by Thorsten Schoelzel)</H2>
<P>
&#187;I am sorry to say it, but the contributions by readers have diminished
rapidly, one reason for this could be the stagnation of the Amiga
market. Unfortunately the Amiga market has not much to offer any more,
it really is a pity! But in spite of that the Amiga market includes
something very valuable, and this is an online magazine with the the
name of "AmigaAktuell", which in my opinion is well worth to be kept
alive, I don't think I am wrong!<BR>
</P><P>
Perhaps it did not come to your mind, but it is up to you to take a share
to keep it that way. In our little market there certainly is a lot to
report about. But even more important is to really do it!<BR>
</P><P>
Certainly I'm not a superb editor, but I enjoy participating in somewhat
and in this special case in the "AmigaAktuell". I'd appreciate it very
much, if someone might follow my example and write one or another article
for "AmigaAktuell".<BR>
</P><P>
Send your article to Carsten Schroeder &lt;<A HREF="mailto:aakt@gmx.de">aakt@gmx.de</A>.<BR>
</P><P>
And now to the essential! You use a program, which you know very well.<BR>
Why not write an article about it? <BR>
</P><P>
Grab a text program and off you go. I use the editor &quote;EditPad&quot;, which
belongs to the AmigaOS3.5 or the internal editor of the mailer &quot;YAM&quot;,
which has advantages compared to EditPad.<BR>
</P><P>
At first explain what kind of program it is altogether, just in three
to five lines. Something what I'll let appear in a software test right
in the title is for instance, that it is a special version, e.g. a
060 version. A little example with help of YAM:<BR>
</P><P>
   YAM v2.0 (060-Version) <BR>
</P><P>
This is the title, which has an advantage for the user. I hope you will
follow this line.<BR>
</P><P>
Next you discuss the installation procedure, if difficulties occured
or not.<BR>
</P><P>
Then you give the special informations about the program you tested,
what features it has and in which way they appear in the use, because
exactly this is important. The user wants to know, what the program will
offer him and not, if it can be installed easyly or not. This chapter
ought to go into details and be furnished with what is known as
&quot;screenshots&quot;. If you want to know, which programs are suited resp.
which may be used for this purpose please contact me via e-mail:
</P><P>
       Thorsten Sch&ouml;lzel (amiga-freak@t-online.de).<BR>
</P><P>
Finally you might list further details as homepages, e-mail addresses,
expectations of future developements and additional facts concerning
the program.<BR>
</P><P>
With this your first report for the &quot;AmigaAktuell&quot; is ready. Take care
to deliver your article early or at the latest in the middle of the
month. Of course you may send it at the end of a month to Carsten, but
please bear in mind, that in this case you you run the risk, that in the
worst case &quot;AmigaAktuell&quot; is released a few days late or that your
contribution cannot appear in the &quot;AmigaAktuell&quot; of the current month.<BR>
</P><P>
I sincerely hope I could motivate many of you to give a share in one of the next editions of &quot;AmigaAktuell&quot;.<BR>
</P><P>
A little hint from me, at some articles it might be helpful to have
a background music running, which you particularly enjoy :-)<BR>
