<H2>2. Introduction of a person: Animation drawer Eric Schwartz (by Oliver Tacke)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;You often hear that NASA still uses Amigas, that in some movies the special effects are made
with Amigas, etc. But you seldom hear about the rather unknown, nonetheless very talented
people still using Amigas. And Eric W. Schwartz is one of them, there is no doubt.
</P>
<P>
In the late eighties, Eric read in a magazine about the Amiga and its fantastic graphic
capabilities, in which he was interested, and so 1988 he bought his first Amiga 500.
</P>
<P>
At this time, he already had an C64 and was, of course, impressed by the possibilities
the Amiga offered. He was especially fascinated by the graphic and sound features.
</P>
<P>
After Eric dicovered the program &quot;Moviesetter&quot; by GoldDisk, he created his first cartoon
movies like &quot;Stealthy Maneuver&quot; and &quot;How to run into a wall&quot;. He made these on the
aforementioned Amiga 500 with one megabyte memory and a second floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
Later, when Eric was on the College, he got an Amiga 2000 and equipped it with 3 MB RAM.
On this computer, he created the (more commonly known) works like &quot;The Anti Lemming Demo&quot;
and the first &quot;Flip the Frog&quot; clip. He was very proud of the latter, because it was (despite
the limit of 3MB) almost four minutes long.
</P>
<P>
And while we are at frogs: the comic intro in the game &quot;SuperFrog&quot; was made by no one
else that Eric.
</P>
<P>
But also some drawings by Eric, commenting the development of the Amiga, should be
well known, for example the legendary &quot;The Survivor&quot;.
</P>
<P>
But the best known characters created by Eric should be Amy and Sabrina, whose
life-story is regulary continued in comic strips on the Internet, and of course,
the Amiga can't be left out there. It started at a Computer fair, where Sabrina is
looking for an Internet provider; went on with several relationship problems of Amy,
on to Sabrinas little sister and pain-in-the-neck Tabitha - well drawn, funny, worth watching!
</P>
<P>
Erics current system is an Amiga 4000T with a Cyberstorm PPC, Cybervision 64,
VLab Motion, Multiport-card, and even more. Exemplary, it runs OS 3.5. For his
drawings, he mostly uses Personal Paint and Photogenics.
</P>
<P>
And what does Eric think about the new Amiga owners Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss and
does he think that finally something good will happen? I will just let him answer himself:
</P>
<P>
&quot;It's difficult to say for certain. I admit, I was more excited when Jim Collas
and Gateway were running things, and the new Amiga OS would have had a Linux
core. I felt that would have been the best hope to bring the Amiga platform
out of obscurity and make it a strong alternative choice to Windows or
Macintosh. I'm not as confident with Bill McEwen's and Fleecy Moss's new
Amiga plans, but I am willing to see what they come up with. It's definitely
better than what little Gateway had planned after Jim Collas left.&quot;
</P>
