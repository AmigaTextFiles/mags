<H2>1. As Commodore did it once: AMIGA sponsors Soccer team (by Markus Tillmann)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Whatever Commodore could do, Amiga can do it better!
</P>
<P>
Since quite a while my head hums with the thought, if it might not be
possible to combine both my most favourite hobbies, Amiga and soccer,
with each other.
</P>
<P>
As the coach of an F-youth soccer group in a club from Moenchengladbach
you permanently are looking for people, which may assist the team in any
way, be it when organizing a tournament, be it for buying new training
clothes.
</P>
<P>
And thus the idea jumped to my mind: Why not just ask Petro Tyschtschenko,
if he might not be ready to lend us a hand at the purchase of new suits by
providing some money for this purpose? After all there once was a very
prominent team, I admit at that time carrying the Commodore sign, making
publicity for the Amiga, of course it was none less than FC Bavaria Munich.
</P>
<P>
So I sent (at first with small hope) an e-mail to Petro Tyschtschenko and
I have to confess, that everything worked out better, than I had dreamed
off.
</P>
<P>
Without any delay I received an answer and with this the signal of interest.
After a few formalities we received our suits marked with "powered by
AMIGA" !!!
</P>
<P>

<A HREF="img/Sponsoring3.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Sponsoring3.jpg" WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Not that I just am delighted personally and enjoy showing off the suit as
often as possible, the team itself is enthusiastic about the new sports
wear and brought home three victories in three games in the recent
games round!
</P>
<P>
But even outside of the team the suits caused sensations at several people
and stirred up questions e.g. &quot;Amiga? Ist it still alive? What in the world
are they doing right now?&quot; Consequently there is no question about Amiga's
success!
</P>
<P>
I wish to express my wholehearted gratitude in the name of the team
of the DJK/VFL Giesenkirchen, of their parents and of further sports
assistants to Amiga and especially to Petro Tyschtschenko! Because today
it cannot be taken as granted and as a simple matter to find sponsors,
who assist children and juveniles to realize their hobbies and visions -
that Amiga did it, shows for me the high rating of this company and I
sincerely hope, that Amiga itself will go from good to better - hopefully
they will reach a position on the market like at that time they were
sponsoring Bavaria Munich.
