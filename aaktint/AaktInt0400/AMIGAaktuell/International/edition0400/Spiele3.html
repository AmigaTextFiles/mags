<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P><B>Hello, dear readers!</B></P>
<P>
Welcome to a new edition of your AMIGA aktuell International games section. Putting the news apart this one is quite
thin again. I wanted to present some new games to you, but I haven't gotten any, though I asked for them.
</P>
<P>
This saves me some work and results in less publicity for the companies. A possible reason could be, that there were no more interest
in tests of AMIGA aktuell. could be due to the fact, that I always tested 'honestly', which is not the usual way on the
Amiga. So, if a game looks and plays like on an A500 in 1988 I evaluate it that way. Even if I am sorry for the developers
and I know very well how much work it is to write a game, which just gets 40%, I am not willing to bring people to the
wrong track as it was done by a certain magazine, which (fortunately) doesn't exist any longer. So I can say, that approx.
80% of the games, which are released for the Amiga are not state of the art. I think, this is due to the fact that
mostly they are written by hobby programmers, which mostly cannot write in the same quality as professional programmers
of a company. Most games have more a lack of good graphics than of good programming. Well, now I am far away from the
beginning, but it is important to get mentioned, because nearly any Amiga medium shirks this. But unfortunately this is
the reality.
</P>
<P>
So you cannot read any reviews in this games section - but it is not my fault - but you can read a preview of the
new jump 'n' run game Ali Baba, which also suffers the previously mentioned aspects.
</P>
<P>
The games from the 'Aminet' section as well as the 'HD-Installer'secion are cancelled for this month. Heiko Garrelts
is still busy studying and I haven't got anything from Ingo Schmitz. Bit it is much more pleasing, that Andreas Koch
was quite active and tested two games for the Mac corner. There are also no informations about new games of the Aminet,
because the Aminet is down for approx. 3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Well, despite of this negative preface I wish you much fun with this edition of the AMIGA aktuell International games
section and, in advance, have a happy easter!
</P>
<P><B>Yours,</B></P>
