<H2>3. News from the CD&sup3;&sup2; alliance</H2>
<P><B>CD&sup3;&sup2;-Allianz (<A HREF="http://home.t-online.de/home/amiga-freak" TARGET="_top">http://home.t-online.de/home/amiga-freak</A>) informiert:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;Help forum for CD&sup3;&sup2; users made available!
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately there are little places for users of the CD&sup3;&sup2;, if you need help. This is what the CD&sup3;&sup2; alliance
is for and created help a forum on their CD&sup3;&sup2; corner.
</P>
<P>
If you have got problems with the CD&sup3;&sup2;, CD&sup3;&sup2; games or hardware or if you are looking for something or
you want to sell something, this is the right place. Use it, because it is the only &quot;CD&sup3;&sup2; only&quot; forum,
we do not know about any other.
</P>
<P>
The help forum is also for CD&sup3;&sup2; users of other countries, because there are many English users, who use
a CD&sup3;&sup2; and they will also need help.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that we would be very happy, if you supported our work by making a link from your homepage to the
CD&sup3;&sup2; corner, because WE do not leave the CD&sup3;&sup2; alone!&lauqo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;CD&sup3;&sup2; alliance presents the CD&sup3;&sup2; developer kit
</P>
<P>
For those software programmers of ree will there is the &quot;CD&sup3;&sup2; developer kit&quot; for download on the
developer site of the CD&sup3;&sup2; corner. Our thanks goes to Amiga, Corp. who gave us the permission.
</P>
<P>
We hope very much, that you use the chance and download the developer kit. Because now the software programmers have the
chance to make their software bootable on the CD&sup3;&sup2; resp. to port their software to the CD&sup3;&sup2;.
</P>
<P>
The developer site is expected to be completed in April, so you will find a manual how to make you own game bootable for
the CD&sup3;&sup2;.
</P>
<P>
Hotlist entry for the CD&sup3;&sup2; possible, now
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the CD&sup3;&sup2; corner could not be put into the hotlist of the web browsers since the latest update in
February. This has changed with the latest update.
</P>
<P><B>We are looking urgent for an English translator!</B></P>
<P>
More than ever the CD&sup3;&sup2; is looking for people with knowledge of the English language.
</P>
<P>
The CD&sup3;&sup2; zone (<A HREF="http://www.amigaemulation.com/cd32">www.amigaemulation.com/cd32</A>) offers an updated
FAQ about the CD&sup3;&sup2; called &quot;CD&sup3;&sup2; FAQ 2000&quot;. Now, the CD&sup3;&sup2; zone wants to have the
FAQ translated into other languages, including German.
</P>
<P>
The CD&sup3;&sup2; alliance would like to do that. But we work on other projects and so we do not have the ressources to
care about the FAQ. This is why we are looking for one person or more persons, who could do this for us.&laquo;
