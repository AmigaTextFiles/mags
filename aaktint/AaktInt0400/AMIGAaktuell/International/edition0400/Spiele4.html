<LI> Amiga Format cancelled
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The edition of April 2000 of the English Amiga magazine Amiga Format, which has many readers in Germany, too, is the
last edition. The Amiga Format now exists since 10 years and has been note for its independence and knowledge. In my
opinion the loss of this high quality is very painful for the Amiga community. The only bright spot is:  Ben Vost
said in a pres release that Amiga Format will be the first magazine reporting about the real return of Amiga technology.

<LI> Simon the Sorcerer II will be released
</LI>

<P>
Epic Marketing announced, that the Amiga version of Simon the Sorcerer II is currently in the beta test phase.
The final version will be released in late April. Let's wait and see.

<LI> Heretic II is nearly ready
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Hyperion Software has nearly finalized Heretic II. If all goes well, the final game will be released within the next
days. Then Heretic II would be the most lavish 3D shooter ever made for the Amiga. In addition Heretic II will make
complete use of the PowerPC as well as 3D extensions as present.

<LI> Zool 3
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Those of you, who kept an eye on the Gremlin website might noticed, that suddenly the Amiga returned on it.
Some days later there was the first announcement. Gremlin works on Zool 3, the successor the the well known
jump 'n' run from 1993. Zool offers a 2D mode (68k) as well as a 3D mode for PowerPC Amigas alone. The game
comes in a disk version as well as on CD-ROM. There will also be a DVD version, but at this point for PCs only.
According to A. Foolsday of Gremlin Software Zool 3 will be revolutionary for the computer game world, because the
player can merge with the game events thank to the also shipped cyberPACK(tm). So the user of the cyberPACK(tm) and
of the Internet can merge with it at any time. The Amiga version will be released approximately 1 year later, which
will be on April 1, 2001, because the cyberPACK(tm) hardware has to be developped for Zorro3.

</UL>
<P>
As already speculated during the last months Hyperion Software got another licence for a 3D shooter. This time
they licenced Sin from Activision Inc. The game is based on the Quake 2 engine from ID Software, as Heretic II is.
This is why Hyperion expects to release the game late 2nd quarter of 2000. The Amiga version requires a PowerPC and
supports Warp3D as well as the OpenGL implementation of Hyperion Software.
