<H2>7. Proposal for the connection of an old with a new Amiga (by Detlef Baranski)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;In the following there are several statements, ideas and proposals, about
which I'd like to learn your opinions concerning their usability and their
possibility of realisation.<BR>
</P><P>
The platform Amiga/DraCo basing upon the 68xxx processor is more or less
history by now. New hardware is imminent and existing harware like PCs off
the market already have come to stay in the graphics sector due to their
clearly higher working speed. The new owners of Amiga also will introduce
a new operating system. Thus an Amiga/Draco user of long standing is now or
later forced to make up his mind about changing to another system. Lots
of users already have switched over or work on different platforms. But
why do some still use the old 68k computer? Because over the years they
became used to the handling of it and of the old applications and with the
change of programs  theyd'd have to throw over board all of their experiences.
The extreme case is the DraCo with Movieshop - most users do not wish to be
without it - but the speed of recent hardware baits.<BR>
</P><P>
IMHO the new owners of Amiga are aware of problems involved and try to
achieve a floating transfer to the new system with help of a 68k emulation
to make the old valuable software run on new machines. But a combination
of software/hardware like Vlab-Motion and Movieshop then are left aside.<BR>
</P><P>
However the solution could be as follows:<BR>
</P><P>
A software/harware combination merging the old one with the new world -
similar to Siamese. The connection of Amiga/DraCo with a PC resp. the NG
hardware! Those attempts ar not really new - similar solutions were tried
with the PC/AT board for the Amiga 2000 or the Siamese system - but they
were not completed. An example being well appraised among professionals
might be the combination of DraCo and PC. The deficiency of the DraCo is
an up-to-date graphical resolution for Movieshop, because the graphics board
only has a bandwidth of 130 MHz. If instead of the graphics board a hardware
adaptor could be inserted into the DraCo slot, which deviates the graphics
to a PC and displays it there and additionally makes calculations and render
jobs possible on the faster hardware, this certainly would be a solution
welcomed by many users of digital video. It might be th association of the
best parts out of two worlds. And even more possibilities can be imagined ...<BR>
</P><P>
The questions arise, if there is sufficient demand and if there is a
manufacturer to jump on the bandwagon?<BR>
</P><P>
And what are the technical possibilities and how are they to be realized?
Zorro-2 to PCI bridge, Fast Ethernet, virtual RAM memory mirrored into
the PC ...?<BR>
</P><P>
In a way it is up to Amiga Inc. to supply this possibility for us ;-)<BR>
</P><P>
Please give me your oppinion.<BR>
