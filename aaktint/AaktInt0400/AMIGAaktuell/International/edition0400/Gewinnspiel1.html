<H1>AMIGA aktuell International competition </H1>
<H2>1. Results of the last competition</H2>
<P>
The syntax of the standard question of the last competition might have been a bit unprecise. But even explaining the
meaning in an AMIGA aktuell Special it seems to be due to this misfortune that the participation went down to a record
level of 13 readers.
</P>
<P>
Well, I promiss to do better in the future and hope to ask the questions without discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
Remember: Even, if you do no know the answer of the master question, you participate on the competition, if you answer the
remaining two questions.
</P>
<P><B>But now, the solution:</B></P>

<P>
One participant was unable to give a prediction.

<P>
Some participants commented the question of opinion (of course, these statements were made before the latest announcements
of AMIGA, so they are not up-to-date in some manners):

<P><B>Christian Aichinger means:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;Any Amiga users are optimists (?), this is why I answered with answer 2, even if I don't really believe in it...
and if so, this would just be an Intel-compatible with a slightly changed version of Elate and some compilers/debuggers
etc.
</P>
<P>
As I have learned, they wont to cooperate with H&amp;P (...note Hewlett Packard...) due to the software emulator and
additional they want to talk with manufacturers, who can provide the hardware (or what soever) (I think, that the name
&quot;BoXeR&quot; was mentioned), because both companies (By the way, when was the BoXeR announced? This wasn before
the PPC boards of P5, wasn't it...???) are known for their &quot;reliability&quot; I don't think, that they won't add
one part for the new developer machines. And a surprise from some other company...mmmh... that's a good one (I just say
Transmeta and ATI and Corel and...)
</P>
<P>
As you might notice, I don't find out what's what... meanwhile this &quot;soap-opera&quot; becomes much too complicated. ;-)
Now, I'll play a bit of Gloom...&laquo;

&raquo;The earlier the &quot; AMIGA developer system&quot; is available the better! But that, what we Amiga fans want
and what is then really offered is quite a difference! So let's wait and see - as always!
Anyway, who is supposed to enjoy the new AMIGA (operating system), which runs only on PPC according to Bill McEwen?
DCE just made the &quot;BVision&quot; available - and no sight of Blzzard 603(+), Cyberstorm PPC and G3/G4!
Because &quot;AMIGA&quot; has no plans in offering hardware - who's going to make it?!
Do they want the AMIGA fans to make the hardware themselves? And who has the money to buy e.g. a CyberstormPPC? It will
surely cost about 1,500 DEM (approx. 765.31 Euros)! So, now it's about saving money to buy the new AMIGA when/if it comes!&laquo;

The latest AMIGA announcements is also mentioned at the end of this edition.
