<H2>1. Experience Report: Amiga-emulator-package &quot;AmigaForever&quot; (by K.-H.Bader)</H2>
<P>
Because my old Multisync died, I bought a new 17&quot;-monitor. Due to an
article by Denis Nikolic from Amiga aktuell Januar 2001, I bought the
Amiga4ever-CD.
</P>
<P>
Cloantos Amiga4Ever run on my system with a PC Celeron 600 - 128MB RAM.
There are two Harddrives with 10GB and 13GB. Now I want to talk about my
earlier experiences.
</P>
<P>
Installation of AmigaOS3.1 was easy from CloantoCD. Only there were
problems with OS3.5 and OS3.9 when installing from the CD's. I transferred
these versions via nullmodem-cable from amiga to pc. In my opinion for
OS3.9 you need at least 128MB RAM, it makes no sense below that level.
</P>
<P>
For the transfer via nullmodem there is a program called &quot;AmigaExplorer&quot; on
the CD. Both computers have to use the same Baud-rate and the same
port-number, e.x. 57600 baud and unit 1 (amiga) com 1 (pc). Well, first I
run WinUAE on Window ME. ME in fact means &quot;more errors&quot;, as there was no
way to establish a internet-connection. Via newsgroups and mailinglists I
was told that even with Win98 the amiga-emulation can connect to internet.
</P>
<P>
So I tried to install Win98 in addition to Window ME. To realize that there
is a tool called &quot;Boot-Manager&quot;, but after reading to docs, I did not want
to install it. After checking my BIOS I realized how to make it: in my BIOS
I can set the boot-drive.
</P>
<P>
First, I removed my WinME-drive from the system and installed Win98 on the
other harddrive. After that I reconnected the first drive again. Now I can
select via BIOS whether to boot from Win98 od WinME.
</P>
<P>
At the PC-side, the is a boot-menu, where to set different settings for
amiga-emulation. I use WinUAE with OS3.9 and KickROM 3.1. Fellow can
emulate older amiga-versions. It is possible with the delivered Kick-ROMs
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.04, 2.1 and 3.0.
</P>
<P>
The BSD-Socket-Library is emulated, that means, I go with the PC online and
can access internet through the emulation. E.x. with YAM, AWebII or
MicroDot2. There is no need for Miami or Genesis.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/amiga4ever1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/amiga4ever1.jpg" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Following some programs I tested more or less.
Naturally, all programs are registered.
</P>
<H3>Text-programs</H3>
<P>
I am writing this text with GoldED 4 Pro and everything runs good, beside
the shortcuts that I cannot translate. For those, I use the
pulldown-menues. I tested FinalWriter and Wordworth just in short. Therefor
I cannot write anythong special about these programs. It will follow with
the next articles. The organizer runs too.
</P>
<H3>Graphics</H3>
<P>
PPaint comes with the Amiga4ever-CD and there are no problems with it.
ArtEffect runs good and even faster as on my A1200. PicManager works after
different tries.
</P>
<H3>Internet</H3>
<P>
In this place the first problems occured. As written above, the
BSD-socket-library has to be emulated and that won't work with WinME, but
with Win98. I will not test it with Win95 :) After my first experiences it
is good to start YAM as being online. In this case the program searches for
BSD-socket-library - it is not available yet and the computer shows
Win98-desktop with the Connection-Wizard. There you must connect to
internet. After the connecting is established, you can go back to emulation
and YAM starts to work. To disconnect, just switch to Win98-desktop using
ALT-TAB, close connection and return to amiga-emulation.
</P>
<P>
AWebII, the version from OS3.9-CD works well. Most problems were with
MicroDot2. This program did not start. Not with my amiga-copies. After
installing it runs more or less often. I don't know where the problem is.
But of course I found a solution: after copying the program into
WBStartup-drawer without its own drawer (that means MicroDot, Data,
MicroDot.prefs, Icons and CM), it runs! After quitting the program it
cannot be started again ! So I use it via WBStartup.

<H3>Games</H3>
<P>
My wife loves to play BackGammon. It runs partially, but one should disable
the sound in preferences otherwise the games cannot be closed and the only
thing that helps is ALT-F4.
</P>
<P>
My favorite Tetris &quot;2000AD&quot; works either. It is played via Joystick. No
special events with it, but perhaps I should just another
screen-resolution. At the moment I use &quot;uaegfx 800x600&quot;.
</P>
<P>
HBMonopoly works well, apart shortcuts. But it works.
</P>
<P>
With my Bowling-game &quot;KingPin&quot; are some problems left. The Demo runs, but
not the Full-Version. But even for that I found a solution: it works, if
the display-configuration of WinUAE ist set to &quot;full-screen&quot; !
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/amiga4ever3.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/amiga4ever3.jpg" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
For all tests I used WinUAE-version from Amiga4Ever-CD, but there are newer
version available, I have not tested yet.
</P>
<P>
Well, thats for today. If someone can give me hints, just mail me ! Even
question will be anwered happily. See you with the next article...
