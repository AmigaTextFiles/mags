<H2>3. Haage &amp; Partner announces &raquo;ArtEffect Plugins Collection&laquo;</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Press release</B></P>
<P>
Highlights of the effects are Glow and DarkGlow (which lets objects glow),
solar, neon and alien (which alienate images), classics like PageCurl, (which
curls a corner of an image), as well as OilPainting, which transforms every
picture or scan into a perfect oil painting. Thanks to the many user-definable
settings, the effects offer countless combinations.
</P>
<P>
For post-processing scanned images and pictures, there are fast, high-quality
filters, such as SmartMedian, which removes distortions within pictures
without making the image unsharp, as well as many blurs such as Average
Blur, Gaussian Blur, Smart Blur and Softener. Of special interest is the highly
optimised version of the &quot;Unsharp Mask&quot;, a sharpening technique which leaves
nothing left to be desired.
</P>
<P>
The PostScript PlugIn offers complete PostScript-output, which is very well
suited for direct printing to a PostScript-Level-2 printer. In addition, EPS-files
can be created, which are well suited for use in other programs such as
PageStream.
</P>
<P>
A new novel feature is the frames-effects, which can give all images a picture
frame. Dull images are now a thing of the past, because with these effects
anyone can make a real piece of art from any picture.
