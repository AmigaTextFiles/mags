<P><B>Amiga Arena Full Version!</B></P>
<P>
With permission of Stefan Berge the Amiga Arena makes
possible the full version of &quot;FileCutter&quot;. &quot;FileCutter&quot;
permits to break down files of any length in as many parts
as you like. By this for instance now you can transfer a file
of e.g. 4MB, which cannot be packed any further, distributed
to 5 diskettes (720 KB).
</P>
<P>
With the latest version this even works with files which have been
split with the NortonCommander on a PC.
</P>
<P>
For instance you can pack a huge directory with the LHA packer and
cut down the created file with help of the 'FileCutter' in parts
of the size of the disk space. These file sections use the disk
space optimally and a problem-free transport of the file with
diskettes is possible.
</P>
<P>
Another example is for instance a huge animation, which otherwise
only on mass-storage devices like removable harddisks or MO drives
could be given away.
</P>
<P>
With the 'FileCutter' now you can split this file in disk-sized
parts and transfer it.
</P>
<P>
Thank goes to Andreas Magerl, who dedicated the full version!&laquo;

<P><B>Amiga Arena Full Version</B></P>
<P>
With permission of Carsten Magerkurth and Andreas Magerl the
Amiga Arena facilitates the release of Offensive COLOURS!
Offensive COLOURS is the exciting synthesis of Tetris and Breakout.
You control a little space-ship in the center of the screen;
coloured blocks grow from the borders of the screen against you.
To stop them, you are armed with a coloured disk, which you can
shoot upon the blocks.
</P>
<P>
If the colour of the disk and the block shot at match, the number
of your bonus points increases and the block disappears. If not,
the disk is reflected to you and the colour of the block and the
disk are interchanged. The new colour of the disk possibly permits
the elimination of another block.
</P>
<P>
If your disk hits a row of equal coloured blocks, the whole row
disappears. The first block gives a standard score, every consecutive
one gives twice the number. The game ends, when the blocks have
reached you.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena Full Version!</B></P>
<P>
With permission of Wayne Ashworth the action game &quot;Renegarde&quot;
is ready for download. (This is a freeware game!) &quot;Renegarde&quot;
is an &quot;Alien Breed&quot; clone for 2 players!
Enjoyment with the game and the successful design speak for
themselves.

<P><B>Amiga Arena Special Price Action!</B></P>
<P>
In cooperation with Andre Beer the Amiga Arena offers a special
price for GeoWorld!
GeoWorld is the only geographical program for the Amiga which is
in development!
For additional informations please visit the GeoWorld homepage -
<A HREF="http://GeoWorld.AmigaSoft.de" TARGET="_top">http://GeoWorld.AmigaSoft.de</A>
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - GeoWorld Appeal!</B></P>
<P>
GeoWorld is one of the very few programs, which stand out against
the usual Amiga software.
</P>
<P>
The developers compiled wideranging information and data, to make
GeoWorld as extensive as possible. Nevertheless such a program
&quot;lives&quot; by the topicality of its data base. To make updates
possible in shorter periods and to continue to offer an all-round
program, the developers need your assistance.
</P>
<P><B>Following tasks are at your disposal!</B></P>
<P>
Extending the acquisition of data on countries which is already under way.
A team would be nice to tidy up the information data at GeoWorld:
rework the available source texts (scanned pages from dictionaries,
HTML/text files from the Internet, partly in English)
and to create a new set of the relevant texts (for instance the
description of natural environment of a country).
</P>
<P>
Of course a full version free of charge will be made available to anyone
helping with the project. Additional remunerations - meaning turnover share -
is possible with extensive cooperation, but don't expect any miracles ...
</P>
<P>
If you are interested please mail to Andre Beer - <A HREF="mailto:AndreBeer@addcom.de">AndreBeer@addcom.de</A>
</P>
<P><B>Postscript from Amiga Arena:</B></P>
<P>
Certainly many will ask why all this fuss?
Sources of information are all over the Internet and in many
programs for the PC as well! But I am one of those Amiga users who
are &quot;Amiga only&quot; and I believe there is a value, in itself, that those
programs continue to be developed!
Furthermore I am very fond of using information sources on the Amiga!
Therefore I must ask you to assist programs like AmiAtlas and GeoWorld
with your feedback.

Arena makes possible the release of &quot;Tautrix&quot;!
&quot;Tautrix&quot; is a puzzle game similar to Tetris!
</P>
<P><B>Short Description</B></P>
<P>
Blocks must be deposited on the play-ground in coloured order as far
as possible without spaces!
If a square block (4x4) forms, this disapears from the play-ground
and you have more room.
</P>
<P>
But because only the square block disappears, it is not easy to move
around the protruding parts!&laquo;
