<H1>Final Words</H1>
<P>
What we need is a Signal (by Carsten Schr&ouml;der)
</P>
<P>
Middle/end of September in Cologne (Germany) an Amiga Fair will be held,
I am sorry to say that actually it is a (small) Amiga section on
a (big) Macintosh event. A few days after this announcement Amiga Plus,
the only Amiga magazine in the German language that you can buy
in shops, discloses that in future it will only be available via subscription.
</P>
<P>
These two incidents unfortunately strike to the root, that as time slips by
the Amiga market has slid down where the Atari has been scraping along for
some time - at the rim of absolute insignificance.
</P>
<P>
In the hope of an Amiga successor we used to  boast of the important
strategic advantage of a quite large number of users, developers and
distributors - this could have promoted the distribution of a new Amiga
substantially. But practically overnight there is nothing left
of this:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> The number of users is, as we must recognize, not even big enough to
  distribute a periodical profitably in shops or to organize an independent
  Amiga show.
</LI>
<BR><LI> There appear nearly no new programs or software versions, and even
  those few cannot compete with the programs on other operating
  systems - just look at the Amiga WWW browsers and wordprocessors,
  which limp miles behind their PC competitors - and the
  distance increases.
</LI>
<BR><LI> A wide area network of Amiga-specialized distributors is more or less
  non existent any more - at this time at most 20 percent
  of users can find a distributor in the neighbourhood.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
My point: The efficient infrastructure advantage, which AMIGA in the past had
over its competitors, for instance Be and QNX, is fading away. It obviously lies in
the hands of the enterprise to establish an Amiga successor in the market
and install the necessary structures, for example, distribution.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the recent Amiga leadership is not completely blameless
for this calamity. Certainly, the decline of Amiga mostly happened before
the year 2000 - but it rather has sped up in the last one-and-a-half
years. The finger must point to the still not clear strategy
and the, it must be stated without any exaggeration, completely
unacceptable information policy of AMIGA. And right here is the key for
a possible improvement in the future. At the upcoming Cologne fair AMIGA
must put it on the line:
</P>
<P>
Public relations must be on full bore. The company must say
what strategies they follow and when those AmigaDE versions with
these features for that operating system will be marketed. It must be
made clear that development of desktop versions of the AmigaDE is in
progress and that the software is more than a multimedia extension for
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
On this message the compamy will be assessed. Should the course of
AMIGA in the future not show a clear line or should announcements or
schedules released in Cologne not be followed, then the company has -
sorry, but rightly - forfeited its reputation - apart from the fact,
that for Amiga in this case probably there will be no rescue at all.
</P>
<P><B>With this until next month,</B></P>
<P>
yours
