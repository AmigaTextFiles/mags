<H2>2. The AMIGA-aktuell-International List of Wishes (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
Only two readers have, after my appeal in the &quot;Final Thoughts&quot; of the
last edition, informed me about their wants and wishes for articles.
Either the dear readers really are a bit lazy about writing or completely
content with everything AMIGA aktuell International offers them ;).
</P>

<P><B>&raquo;Hallo Christian,</B></P>
<P>
followed your appeal and  write here a few remarks. At first I must
express that I appreciate AA very much, and that you should continue
as you do right now. The AA easy to read and is not overtechnical.
In fact there sure is something for everybody. The competition questions
can be solved by anybody.
</P>
<P>
As themes I would propose these examples: Phoning via Internet with the
Amiga, the Euro on the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Best regards,<BR>

<P><B>&raquo;Hi!</B></P>
<P>
A short comment concerning constructive criticism: I haven't any! If
you little or no e-mail on this topic, you can assume that the magazine is
good as it is, or that the readers do not know what could be improved. When
the participation in the FDCharts is so low, then the reason
is probably that this means work for a reader to look for games, to
test and evaluate them. This he must do, if he isn't busy trying
knockout PD software anyway in his free time. I rather consider the section
&quot;Little helpers for everyday Amiga usage&quot; as more my style.
</P>
<P>
Of course I cannot understand people fussing about the sections or sending
insults to you.
</P>
<P>
You want to know my must-have article? Hum, just one jumps
to mind: Finally I have succeeded in getting Socks5 with Genesis running, and at the
same time the server I route my DOS-machine through the Amiga onto the Internet.
Unfortunately I have no idea how to configure that device so's the
firewall is running. Right now it is still open, like minisockd from the Aminet,
without security protocols. An article about the topic &quot;How
to configure socks5 in a sensible way&quot; would really be great for me. But
it is a quite specialist subject.
</P>
<P><B>Oops, now I'm getting long-winded. :)</B></P>
<P><B>Regards, Kai&laquo;</B></P>
<P>
First of all, thank you for your e-mails and the nice compliments. The
topics you raise will certainly be interesting to other readers. If
there is someone with experience in Internet phoning, Euro on the
Amiga or Socks5 configuration ... come on, hit the keys and let's have
it ;)! We at AMIGA aktuell are also looking for authors who could
write something about the various PCI extensions from DCE (G-Rex) and Matay
(Prometheus). And some time ago a reader expressed the wish to read a
direct comparison between Opus Magellan, EASys and Scalos. The topic
of networking (Ethernet, Router, Hubs, Switches, TCP/IP, ADSL and more) is
way up there in readers' top top lists of wishes.
</P>
<P>
We have considered that it might be a good idea to publish this list
of wishes regularly in AMIGA aktuell (International). Every reader would be
invited to inform us about his wishes for articles. I would be ready to collect
this list of wants and wishes and publish it in the Forum.
</P>
<P>
But this would depend upon the resonance of the reader (that means, of
you, who is reading, and only reading, these lines ;)). If we receive only readers'
requests, but no appropriate articles, the compilation of a list of
wishes would be unnecessary, as you will understand.
