<H2>4. Statement of Haage &amp; Partner to ArtEffect PPC</H2>
<P><B>Haage &amp; Partner (<A HREF="http://www.haage-partner.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.haage-partner.de</A>) informs:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;Why is there no PPC-version of ArtEffect or its Plugins?
</P>
<P>
If we compile the plugins for the PowerPC, the speed-improvement for versions 3
and 4 is minimal, and virtually non-existent. This is, for the most part, due to
the internal structure of AE, which consistently uses the OS for its virtual
memory management. This leads to the prevalent context-switches between PPC- and
68k-CPU's on the Phase5-boards, eliminating any possible speed-increases.
</P>
<P>
A translation of AE (considering that the OS runs almost exclusively on the
68k), would virtually mean programming it from scratch. This wouldn't make
sense, because it would run at full speed on &quot;normal&quot; PPC-systems (without a
68k-CPU). We've been waiting for such a system for three years, but naturally
had no way of knowing about it in advance. Our suspicions were confirmed, and
this statement can be found in the product AmigaWriter. Here we went through a
great deal of trouble to create a special Phase5-PPC optimised version. This
resulted in a speed-increase of 5 to 30% with some functions. This a far away
from the expected 5 to 10-fold speed increase (5-fold because of the 5x higher
tact rate of the PPC, and doubling speed through the superior techniques of the
CPU).
</P>
<P>
Other programmers can readily testify to this fact. However, there are
exceptions; such as when a program is divided into ideal modules, and can
perform the pure calculations on the PPC as long as possible without having to
switch to the 68k. Examples of this are Tornado3D and Wildfire, which actually
achieve a 5 to 10-fold speed increase with the PPC.
</P>
<P>
In the past we have often contemplated whether we should publish this viewpoint
or not. We chose not to, as we wouldn't endanger the market any further, since
for publishers and retailers it has been a declining venture for a long time.
We've been hoping for the release of &quot;real&quot; PPC-boards for the Amiga (we had
known of at least half a dozen such projects). It's surprising that hardly
anyone wondered why we didn't publish a PPC-version of our programs, when we
mentioned in the StormC advertisements that only a new compilation would be
needed for it. Had we been under pressure from the Amiga community, we probably
would have made this statement earlier, but since no-one asked...
