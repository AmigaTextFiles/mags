<H2>4. Review: Cheatmania</H2>
<P>
Cheatmania is a hot one for the gamblers (and not only for them).  If you cannot
afford to go to Las Vegas or you could but are just simply afraid to go the
casino because you lose (who knows, maybe you could win), then it is time to
check your gambler's abilities playing this game.
</P>
<P>
Cheatmania is, next to Monster Mind or the upcoming Poker Challenge, one of the
simple, in theory, games created by Stylon Crew. This team consists of sceners.
Program/Code was made by Twystor, nice, 256 coloured graphics was made by
members of Scoopex, TRSI, Kefrens and by individuals like Made and Hotshot.
Everything has been given nice atmospheric sounds composed by XTD and Odie.
Great mix, isn't it? But what is the game?
</P>
<P>
Cheatmania is a &quot;simulator&quot; of a one-armed bandit (I guess you call it that in
English too) made in a horror style. During your trip your car breaks down. It's
raining, a storm is brewing, and only flashes of lightning reveal the
surroundings. Between the lightning you notice the castle and decide to go in
there. Happens to me all the time.
</P>

<P>
Our one-armed bandit is quite unusual.  On the wheels, instead of traditional
fruits like plums, cherries, bananas, apples or other cute pictures to give
different prizes, we have spiders, beasts, skulls, pentagrams or
Jack'o'Lanterns. There are four wheels instead of the usual three (or five or
six if you're Australian), so there is more variation, at the cost of a lower
probability of winning (ditto if you're Australian). Basically you have to get
three or four of the same symbol to line up on the wheels.
</P>
<P>
Very important is the bet.  Make it bigger (up to $10) and get a bigger
probability of winning and also of trying your luck and skills in one of the
many bonus games.
</P>
<P>
Yes! Cheatmania is not just pulling a handle to have another spin, it is also
playing bonus games like shooting at the bugs, catching symbols, guessing where
the crystal is and so on. The sort of games depends on the bet. For $3 you get
Beast Mode, $5 triggers Skull Mode, at $7 Cash Mode kicks in and for the maximum
$10 bet Jackpot Mode. Each mode offers special games.
</P>

<P>
This is not all.  When you win sometimes you can multiply the prize up to six
times. Here you have to show how good your speed is. If you get multiply by six
you also win the chance to play in another bonus game. A special bonus game is
also available after achieving the number of the devil - 666.
</P>
<P>
To sum up, there are 11 games.  Each has many variations depending on the
symbols that show on the wheels. Add to this 6 special bonuses and you have to
admit that Cheatmania makes playing a one-armed bandit a little more interesting
and stops the player getting bored.
</P>
<P>
But there's more.  The author thought that playing for play money can sometimes
feel pointless, so Cheatmania lets you spend the money you win. For $50, buy the
chance to practise one of the many bonus games. For $150 enter the gallery and
buy one of the many pictures. These pictures, like all the graphics in the game,
are made in a horror style and I liked them. There are about 40 of them. As well
as getting to look at them, the pictures are saved to disk by way of a prize.
They are saved as an IFFs so you can add them to your collection. For me it is
great idea! You know what you are playing for.
</P>

<P>
As you can see playing Cheatmania is not only based on luck but also on your own
abilities like speed and similar. It makes you take a chance and in all this
there is some purpose (the pictures).
</P>
<P>
Cheatmania is a very nice game.  It is a perfect example of how a simple game
can be made interesting with great audio-visual effects. Cheatmania requires AGA
Chipset, at least 1.7MB of Chip Ram and about 3MB of Fast Ram. Before starting
the game you have to define a path where the pictures will be saved. Cheatmania
can be obtained from the author or from Aminet. It is freeware.
