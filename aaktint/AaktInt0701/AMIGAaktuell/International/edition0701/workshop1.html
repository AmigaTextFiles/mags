<H2>1. Workshop: Virtual Network Computing - part 3 (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P><B>The master of remote control - part 3</B></P>
<P><B>A Telnet daemon on the Amiga</B></P>
<H3>1. One more server</H3>
<P>
In the article on VNCS on the last issue of Amiga aktuell, the
Amiga was acting as a server, making its screen output available
over an Intranet or even worldwide through the Internet, if
desired.
</P>
<P>
This required an Amiga well equipped with RAM and processing
power. But as you will learn now, a much more modest
configuration can be remote-controlled via TCP/IP, even if it is
a little more inconvenient for an Amiga user who is used to
intuitive mouse control.
</P>
<P>
We are talking about the old and honored telnet. Clients for
controlling other computers can be found in vast amounts on the
Aminet and are usable without much installation. Let's see if
this is also true for telnet daemons...
</P>
<H3>2. System requirements</H3>
<P>
The program package of our choice will be  &quot;Telnetd 2.0&quot; [1] from
Peter Simons and Steve Holland. The requirements are quite
humble. All you need is an Amiga with a TCP/IP stack. Telnetd was
written for use with AmiTCP, but, as you will see, it also works
well with Miami.
</P>
<H3>3. Installation</H3>
<P>
After unarchiving the file extracted either from Aminet or the
Aminet CD-ROM No. 15, you'll find several subdirectories.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/telnet_dir.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/telnet_dir.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="83" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
All files from the directories  &quot;c&quot;, &quot;devs&quot; and &quot;s&quot; have to be
copied to the corresponding directories on the system partitions.
Then move the directory &quot;serv&quot; into the Miami drawer and the
manual anywhere you want.
That's all.
</P>
<H3>4. Miami configuration</H3>
<H4>4.1 InetD</H4>
<P>
Start up Miami, go to the database section and select the entry
InetD. Add the following: service &quot;telnet&quot;, socket &quot;stream&quot;,
protocol &quot;TCP&quot; and &quot;nowait&quot;, the user will be &quot;root&quot;, the server
is  &quot;Miami:/serv/telnetd&quot; and the name can be left blank.
</P>

<P>
4.2 Users
The user to login later is configured in the same database module
in the section &quot;users&quot;. Probably there are already some existing
users from earlier configurations. All potential users who want
access through telnet will need a password and a shell,
because the complete telnet access is handled in this shell.
The user in our example will be called &quot;uwep&quot;. He gets a password
and under 'Shell' the entry &quot;*NewShell * from s:remote-startup&quot;.
This is to make sure that the output of the Shell will be sent to
the remote computer.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/telnet_miami2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/telnet_miami2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="38" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
This completes the configuration. Save it under a telling name.
Now it is time to go online.
</P>
<H3>5. Using the server</H3>
<P>
From now on, all users defined in Miami can log into the Amiga
and manipulate it as they wish. Of course, we are going to test
that right now. Almost every operating system includes a telnet
client. Under Linux, you can evoke telnet by entering &quot;telnet
hostname&quot; or &quot;telnet IP address&quot; into a shell. Of course you have
to give the correct hostname or IP address of the Amiga we
prepared earlier. The Amiga in this example can be reached under
the name &quot;amiga.xwing.de&quot; or the IP  &quot;192.168.0.2&quot;.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/telnet_linux.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/telnet_linux.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="62" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Under Windows, you can use the MS-DOS prompt to start telnet. The
syntax is the same as under Linux. You will then be requested to
enter a username and the password. If this information was
correct, you will find yourself in a Shell on the Amiga.
You can check the logon on the Amiga itself, because Miami keeps
an entry in its Log window.
</P>

<H3>6. Security</H3>
<P>
As easy as installation and usage of a telnet daemon may be, you
should be aware that all information is transferred unencrypted
over telnet. This includes passwords and other valuable data.
This might be acceptable for use in an Intranet, but if you want
to control the Amiga over an Internet connection, this is a
serious security issue. In these cases, SSH is a safer method,
since it encrypts the transferred information.
</P>
<P>
You should also never forget that the Amiga is a single user
operating system.
</P>
<P>
Every user who is logged in via telnet or another service can do
serious harm to your system. This can be helped by using the
MultiUser-Filessystem [2] from Geert Uytterhoeven, but this takes
some effort.
