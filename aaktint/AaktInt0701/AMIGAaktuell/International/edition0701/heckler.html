<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>The pane barrier</B></P>
<P>
In the morning the world is still comprehensible. Something like this I
once read somewhere, and for the most part it is correct. When
the morning sun is shining brightly from the sky, it doesn't bother
me too much when once again the coffee-cream has run out. Until the not so well
cleaned window panes make me a bit toey: they dull the unclouded
zest for the sunshine. Jumping to a decision: The windows must be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
A situation we meet every day. There is something annoying, so we have
to settle it somehow. At least, as long as no-one puts a spoke in our
wheels (and for instance hides the window cleaner somewhere!?).
</P>
<P>
But recently I'm troubled by a suspiciously high number of things. From
every direction. The necessary change in technical and social aspects
grinds in all the joints.
</P>
<P>
I'll leave it open if this has to do with the fact that lately Dennis
Tito made a little trip to the ISS or that I viewed once too often
the movie &quot;Mission to Mars&quot;.
</P>
<P>
My anxiety grows. Am I or the rest of mankind missing something? A
change of scene happens (theoretically) quite fast. And the old ways
have to change.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War, big hopes were stirred up. It seemed
that a big knot had come loose. The possibility seemed to
be there at last to be able to care for the important problems
of mankind. From the political change, social and the technical ones
would follow.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of that I am dissatisfied. Not only that in some regions
of earth again wars are imminent or already raging, the environmental
pollution jauntily proceeds and famine and grief of whole peoples
depress the conscience of mankind. In this country the atmosphere
has become different, too. When at first people lamented their fate and
got their scoldings from politics and economics, now the the politics
and economics wail and cannot understand why their messages are not
received.
</P>
<P>
The press discloses to me that this is a global phenomenon. And
apparently no-one knows the way out of this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
My individual advice to mankind: We have a gigantic dirty
window pane before our very eyes. It is time to clean it properly. Maybe
then we all will see a beautiful sunrise and stop fretting that we
forgot to buy coffee-cream again.
</P>
<P>
If now someone asks, how all this relates to the Amiga .... no idea.
Perhaps it will occur to me by the next heckling. I'm ready to listen
to your advice!!
