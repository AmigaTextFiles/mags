<P><B>Airsoft Softwair (<A HREF="http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de</A>) informs:</B></P>
<P><B>&raquo;CD32 Games Install Kit v4.4NG released</B></P>
<P>
Here's a new update for owners of the &quot;The Best of Airsoft Softwair Gold
Edition&quot; CD-ROM. Version 4.4 NG of the Install Kit supports much more games now
(182 in total). I also made some minor optimizations and bug fixes. To download
this update please use the program &quot;Updater&quot; which is contained on the CD-ROM,
or click here. This version of the CD32 Games Install Kit is only available for
owners of the CD-ROM. The last public, shareware version is 3.9.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;CD32 Games Install Kit v4.41NG released</B></P>
<P>
A heavy bug was fixed in this release. Please download and install it if you're
using version 4.4!&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;Install Kit for Windows</B></P>
<P>
As some emulation sites already posted this news, here's the &quot;official&quot; :-)
annoucement for the Windows version of my CD32 Games Install Kit: It will work
in connection with WinUAE and it will be available quite soon. The compatibility
is very high because every game uses custom patches (just like in the Amiga
version). Additionally you won't have to install the game, you can run it right
from the CD although in some cases some files have to be copied (which need to
be patched). CD audio support is not supported yet but will be added for sure
later. The first version of the CD32 Games Install Kit 4.5 (Win32 1.0) can be
expected in one week. But currently it will be only available for owners of the
&quot;The Best Of Airsoft Softwair Gold Edition&quot; CD-ROM, so order it now :-). Some
Screenshoots are available on Airsoft-Software-Homepage.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;Ordering via RegNet (accepts credit cards!) now possible!</B></P>
<P>
As there were a lot of people voting for this option in the poll, I finally
signed up at RegNet. This means for you that it's now possible to order my
programs with credit card. Currently only the &quot;The Best Of Airsoft Softwair Gold
Edition&quot; CD-ROM can be ordered via RegNet but I will add the other Shareware
programs soon. Click here to order a copy of the &quot;The Best Of Airsoft Softwair
Gold Edition&quot; CD-ROM with your credit card now! From people outside Europe it
might also be interesting that RegNet does also accept checks and money orders
which I don't accept (I accept only euro checks!). Additionally it is also
possible to order by phone (1-800-WWW2REG).&laquo;
