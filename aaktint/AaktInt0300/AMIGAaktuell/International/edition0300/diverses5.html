<BR><LI> Michaela Pruess informs: &raquo;After the last Amiga oriented search engine closed with the shutdown of AmigaCrawler
there is a REAL search engine with own database online.
<P>
  On <A HREF="http://amiga.ac" TARGET="_top">http://amiga.ac</A> every Amiga user can report his pages in the web (and also
  any other Amiga page, he knows). After a few days thousands of pages were reported and scanned, so the search functions
  are open since today (14 days earlier as planned). The data pool is still incomplete, but with each new hour it grows,
  what shows, that a search engine is not only wanted, but really required.&laquo;
