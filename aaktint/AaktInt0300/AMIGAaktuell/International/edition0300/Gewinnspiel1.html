Some participants wrote their opinion in detail:
</P>
<P>
Holger Jeromin expects negative consequences, &raquo;this depends especially, if the G4 boards of P5 can be built by
anyone else.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kurtz write: &raquo;In my opinion the insolvency of Phase 5 will have extremely negative consequences for the Amiga.
We can only hope, that the development of the G4 boards is done by another company, if Phase 5 really should go into bankrupcy.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Sascha van Wahnem means:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;A long time ago phase 5 sold its Amiga products to DCE. It is very likely, that this was to make some money with a
dead branch and to delay the insolvency. But you should not give phase 5 too little importance. During the years Phase 5
built an image, which has been standing for power and innovation. You have also to consider, that phase 5 built the first
3D graphics boards for the Amiga and especially the PPC generation (CPU and graphics boards) were not existant on the
Amiga without phase 5 and we would still use the 68k-structure.&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Even, if phase 5 was present in the Mac market and it is very likely that this led to their death. The name phase 5
equals Blizzard and Cyberstorm. For the outstanding user this might be deterancing.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
<B>Hendrik Stahl expects little negative consequences:</B>
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I always thought, that phase 5 was not really an honest company. The hardware, that was announced by P5 mostly came
with a big delay, which might be handled, but the fine explanations the pre-subscribers got from them, were just
embarrassing! This is why I don't think, that the death of P5 is a really big loss for the Amiga, in the contrary!
It COULD have positive consequences, if one or the other honest company does the development of the G4 boards. Because
then, we can expect a more punctual appearance of the hardware, I think...&laquo;
</P>
<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
The insolvency of Phase 5 is evaluated negative by most people. But there are some people, who do not expect any negative
consequences for the Amiga market. However, it would be positive, if DCE succeeded in developping the G4 boards announced
by Phase 5.
