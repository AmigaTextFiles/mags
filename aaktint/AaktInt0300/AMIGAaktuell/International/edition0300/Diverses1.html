<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Thomas Dellert:&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">For sure existing hardware will be produced at first. There
are a lot of preorders. Since Permedia II chips have been announced by TI, we probable will be able to produce only a number
of 1200 BVision or CV-PPC boards. Hence we are thinking about a Permedia III board for Amiga. This might be mounted upon the
existing BVision or CV-PPC platform. Frank Mariak will develop the software for us. With the entire amount of technical
know-how of Phase5 we now have a powerful package at our disposal. In any case there will be activities relating PPC. For the
time being as a dual CPU resolution only.&nbsp;</TD></TR>

&raquo;Phase 5's Application for Insolvency - Several Questions - 02/15/2000
</P>
<P>
Several questions were raised by Phase5 digital products' application for insolvency, which we have sent by Fax to the
provisional receiver, Mrs. Angelika Amend on February 10., 2000.
</P>
<P>
At first the questions we have submitted:
</P>
<P>
Many users have sent in devices (CPU boards, etc.) to Phase 5 for repair. Some of these under terms of guarantee, but some
also liable for costs. What can those users do to get their boards back as soon as possible (repaired or not)?
</P>
<P>
Subject: Prepaiments for preordered G3/G4 boards.<BR>
If we are informed properly, prepayments were made against the background that those payments will be effected to an account
in trust. Such a statement was made by Phase 5 in the media back then to make sure that the customers would get back their
money, if those boards would be never released (whatever the reason). Was the money of those customers actualy effected to
an account in trust, or are those payments possibly part of the insolvency procedure?
</P>
<P>
We have heard from several sources Phase 5 would consist of two companies. One a Ltd. (associates are not known by me) and
the other one an association of common law between Wolf Dietrich and Gerald Karda. This brings up a question, which of these
companies has made the application for insolvency. Unfortuantly, one could not find out the form of the association from the
letter on which the recieved press release was written.
</P>
<P>
How will a user come to know if the insolvency proceedings have been disclosed, so that potentially aggrieved people are able
to log on their rights?
</P>
<P>
Answer from 15.02.2000
</P>
<P>
Today we recieved the following answers, which we mirror here word by word:

Insolvency proceedings for Phase 5 digital products
</P>
<P>
Dear Mrs. Petra Struck,
</P>
<P>
in response to your writing from 02/10/2000.
</P>
<P>
At present the users only can wait and see, if insolvency proceedings will be disclosed. Because the suspended business
activities there are currently no repairs made etc. The users should solely denounce thier pretensions with the signatory.
Up to now the signatory does not know about an account in trust.
</P>
<P>
Insolvency proceedings are pending only for the acquirements of the association of common law, existing of Wolf Dietrich and
Gerald Carda. The users are creditors of the association, so they will be informed about the disclosure of insolvency
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely yours
</P>
