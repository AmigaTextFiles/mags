Big brother and there's no end
</P>
<P>
Oops... these are exciting times. Old stuff goes and new stuff comes.
</P>
<P>
The nice, colourul pictures on the CeBIT show, where the targets of the IT-branch are.
</P>
<P>
There they tell the usual phrases (&quot;Buy, people buy, there will not be much left, soon !!&quot;) and in a yarning
atmosphere we are introduced into the new Internet age.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce-branch tells us, that soon we are going to buy our cucumbers on the Internet only, because they were
much fresher and erect there. The Internet-wine is much tastier and easier degistible than the one from the supermarket.
And I have always wanted a nice raffia skirt from the Carribean...
</P>
<P>
Wonderful times are coming. If ... well, if the warnings about a new monster named &quot;Echelon&quot; became not louder
and louder.
</P>
<P>
In brief, Echelon is a gigant listening-machine of the American NSA (National Security Agency). If you are interested
the common search engines show you a lot of informations in this matter. On this place details would be boring. But
this should make some people listen:
</P>
<P>
The (German) Bundesamt fuer Sicherheit in der Informationstechnologie (Federal office for security in information technology)
warned about the fact, that the common surfer is much too careless about his privae data, a short time ago in a press
release. Even the favorized PGP (Pretty Good Pricacy) got a bad evaluation. Too easy to manipulate and too easy for
powerful decoding machines. So, if we conclude it should be at least a 128bit code.
</P>
<P>
With all the euphoric feelings in the Internet branch, on thing becomes very clear:
Previously neglected dangers of the global communication and the continous accessability, which is a possible continous
control through third parties, become more and more clear to the public during the last months.
</P>
<P>
What's this all about the Amiga?
</P>
<P>
We are at the starting point of a new kind of computer technology. This will be controlled no longer primarily by the
hardware but by intelligent software concepts. This could become a new market of the new Amiga. From the game box to
the HiTech-Data-Security-System.
</P>
<P>
Also, the alternatives Linux and Windows can only react with the evolving computer technology on the problems of data
security. So the cards are shuffled again.
</P>
<P>
Never before the chances for a big comeback of the Amiga were so good as they are today. Maybe, there will be sausage friers
with the Amiga operating system in computer centres of big companies. An alternative for data, which require special
a security handling is also possible.
</P>
<P>
We are still waiting for answers from Reading and Langen (sorry Fleecy and Bill ... this is just closer to Munich) ;-)
</P>
<P>
We are going to present us to TAO and Amiga Inc. ..... the clock is ticking and other ones are making your money. So,
LET'S GO to the future.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time I enjoy the time (quite conservative) with a botle of good supermarket-wine. If you are interested,
I tell you the brand .... without PGP&nbsp;;-)
</P>
