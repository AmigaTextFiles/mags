<H1>Amiga PowerPC</H1>
<H2>1. Development of the announced full text translator software warpTrans cancelled</H2>
<P><B>Andreas Wendorf informs:</B></P>
<P><B>&raquo;Press release</B></P>
<P><B>Hello to all Amigans!</B></P>
<P>
After a long winter rest, we of Warp9 report back.
There was much trouble in our team, so our project were in danger.
</P>
<P>
The warpTrans project (translation software) and the wARPgATe (news &amp; information
page about warpOS &amp; warp3D) have to be mentioned for example. A long time we had not the courage to release the
results of our survey. But, it is our opnion, that it is important to make it clear and to bring light into the darkness.
First of all, we want to introduce our warpTrans project in brief, again.
After a complete translator database (English-German) with a gigantic vocabulary and grammar section was given to us,
a Dutch team of programmers got the job from us. The first professional translation program for the Amiga was wanted
to exist. We got a number of innovative ideas, which have be realized mostly.
</P>
<P>
The voice recognition was one of the most important parts, the team was able to port with lots of work. Because such a program
requires much computing power, we set the requirements on a high level, which was accepted from the users. Many of the
feedback (just 70 mails) said, that the technical requirements were too high. Even, if the program was made public in various
press releases, in any Amiga news pages and there were even articles in the Amiga press there were just 70 eMails and 2
lousy advanced orders. This led to the complete demotivation of our programmers and made us to not complete the program.
It is a pity, but we canno invest one more Deutschmark into the project. Many would have liked to see a really useable
software on the PPC-Amiga. But it should not have been. We didn't expect that - we cannot say more about this.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore we want to apologize for the delay of the re-opening of wARPgATe. Due to reasons of time it was impossible.
It would not be wise to make further promisses. But we want to assure you, that this page is not dead. And it will
definitely updated in spring.
</P>
<P>
We ask all warpOS&amp;3D developers to send us informations and news on a regular basis.
(E-Mail an <A HREF="mailto:news@w-9.de">news@w-9.de</A>). The new design of wARPgATE has been completed at this point of
time. So it goes on.
</P>
<P>
A regular watch on our Internet page (<A HREF="http://www.w-9.de">www.w-9.de</A>) cannot be wrong.
