For you and for all of us

Some days ago I got this eMail of Thorsten Schoelzel:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I have a suggestion of improvement for Amiga aktuell (International). Can't you introduce a section, which is about
szene-demos?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
I get these and similar requests again and again and I have to refuse it again and again with these words:
&raquo;Up to now, no one has been found to do this job.&laquo; Because that is the problem - there are many suggestions
of improvement for AMIGA aktuell International. But unfortunately there are no people, who want and are able to do the job.
</P>
<P>
AMIGA aktuell (International) is a magazine, which exists due to the help of its readers. As you might know, the editors
do not make any money, but invest their time in the project - for you and all of you - &quot;just for fun&quot;.
</P>
<P>
To come to the point: Unfortunately I had to find out during the last months, that the participation for our magazine
stagnates, in some parts - e.g. the hardware - and software tests - it decreases. Of course, I know, that the
motivation is not the best in those difficult Amiga times, but I would expect a better commitment - and I think, I can
expect it.
</P>
<P>
A magazin with a few dozen readers the current participation might be alright, but for a magazine like AMIGA aktuell (International)
with more  than 800 direct subscribers, this is a bit poor, I think.
</P>
<P>
Maybe, one or the other needs a god communication platform. For this purpose I think about installing a public mailing list,
which is for anything about AMIGA aktuell (International), either suggestions or ideas, questions, news etc. Please write
me, how you think about the idea - write to <A HREF="mailto:aakt@gmx.de">aakt@gmx.de</A> .
</P>
<P><B>See you, next month,</B></P>
<P>
yours,
