<H1>16. HD-Installer: Reviews</H1>
<P>
<P>
We start this section with the 2 games of the Bitmap Brothers, Gods and The Chaos Engine (AGA)
</P>
<P>
Gods:
</P>
<P>
The main thing in the action adventure is to complete the levels through fighting and to solve a more or less difficult job
like switching switches in the correct order. There are various HD-Installers for this game. I use the WHDGods-Installer,
which uses WHDLoad, because the other one (JST-based) installer does not work on my system. But due to the WHDLoad emulations
of JST you can use JST for this installer anyway. After the easy installation the game can be started directly. Regarding
the speed: on a 030-system the speed is approximately the same as on the 500 or a bit faster, on my PPC-board (040/25)
the game is slower (!) as on the 500, approximately about the half (!!!). If you set the Tool types to NOCACHE, the game
speeds up a bit, but not much. On 060-systems the speed is approximately the same as on 030-systems. A positive aspect to
mention is that the game can quit using any hotkey (Tool types). Apart from this it is identical with the &quot;common&quot;
disk version.

The Chaos Engine (AGA):
</P>
<P>
This game is an action game with puzzle elements, tool. The main target in this game is to destroy the so called
Chaos Engine.

For this game I use the JST-Installer. The installation is easy with this game, too, if you installed JST correctly.
If the 2 disks have been put to hard disk the game can easily be started. The speed is fine on 030-systems as well as on
060-systems, but on the Blizzard-PPC the game is just unplayable !! Imagine a 500 with 30 programs running at the same
time :-). But honestly, the game cannot played even with the caches switched off using the NOCACHE option. But this is
only true for the Blizzard-PPC, on other boards the speed is alright. This game can also be quit using a hotkey.
The HighScore list is saved, too.
