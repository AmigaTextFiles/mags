<H2>4. Impulse for Discussion: 68060 Processor (by Thorsten Schoelzel)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;First a question to all of you: who at all does use one?
An additional question is, why programmers transfer their software to this processor really weak.
</P>
<P>
I for myself gladly boast the ownership of a Blizzard1260/50MHz and I was quite proud when I bought this a few years ago.
The competent press releases highly praised especially this processor resp. board, but I cannot see why, when I play a game
of Quake.
</P>
<P>
The Blizzard1260 is furnished with the 68060 processor from Motorola with an internal FPU and an MMU. You may compare the
power of such an Amiga with a 586 PC.
</P>
<P>
Why isn't it possible to get Quake running on fullscreen with a decent speed? What do you need a 060 processor for, it
might be much better to take the cheaper Blizzard1240/40, mightn't it? I really am stirred up, that I already have a fast
processor but still miss the relevant software.
</P>
<P>It does not mean just to change a few statements in a program, it takes quite a lot more. Some demos in the scene show
the power in such a processor, it ought to be possible to transform it generally.
</P>
<P>
Because several among you will ask, why I do not change to PPC, let me explain the following. The Amiga is dead and only may
be saved by Amiga Incorporated. Therefore it would be a waste of money, if I'd spend it for improvements of my classic Amiga
(with are a few exceptions).
</P>
<P>
Certainly, a system with PPC turboboard & PPC graphics board would not be bad, but what for? Just to say I have a PPC? No,
fellows, my money is to good for this, and beside of that my system is completely sufficient for me, even if I miss some
items, which can be found at PPC, before all reasonable MPEG, Quicktime & AVI players.
</P>
<P>
The best example may be AmiPEG, which only runs in AGA mode,
but an MPEG movie is played in near full screen with true speed.
What a significance would have a further developement of this
player for the Amiga 68k series (Sound & FullScreen picture)!
But I like especially a newcomer named "Frogger". It would be
desirable, that the programmer might assist existing sound boards,
then, I am sure, you could listen to the sound of a MPEG movie,
the assistance of the MPEGit modul might be advisable. I'd be
glad, if in the near future they would attend to it.
</P>
<P>
There are so many points I might lay hold of to discuss about, because fully developed software for the Amiga is a complete
miss.
</P>
<P>
It is a pity, that no changes are in sight and the Amiga will pursue its way downwards.
