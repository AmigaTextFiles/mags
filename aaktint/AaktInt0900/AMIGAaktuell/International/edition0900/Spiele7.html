<H3>Mahjongg Tiles</H3>
<P>
It's approx. a year ago, when I understood how to play Mahjongg/Shanghaii. Since then I'm playing this really
hard game...
</P>
<P>
I bet, that every human being (except me, of course) is able to play this game. But for those of you, who have
the same intellect as I (don't take this personally ;-)) I explain it to you:
</P>
<P>
The playing field is a number of small stones, which have approx. the size of Domino stones and have different
motives. These stones are put onto one heap. Now you have to find the pairs, which is like the game Memory
(just that you can see the pictures). The found pair might be removed. Your goal is to find all pairs. But you are not
allowed to remove any stone. There must not be stones on both sides of the stone (as I understood it...).
It sounds easy, but it is really difficult. You can believe it!
</P>
<P>
Well, this program is a Workbench version of the game.
</P>
<P>
This is also its biggest problem. Because it uses the palette of
the WB screen. And then I can hardly see the motives of the stones. Fortunatly there are other picture sets and you can
also easily create own sets, but it's not the hit...
Maybe, this is due to my Amiga, I'm not sure about it.
</P>
<P>
The sound is also held easy...to avoid saying: There isn't any...
</P>
<P>
But it is fun, and it is funny. Those who are looking for a better alternative, should try the game &quot;Tiles&quot;.
This has a (bit) nicer graphics.
</P>

<H3>WormWars</H3>
<P>
This is one of those games, where you think &quot;Oooh, what piece of junk is that???&quot; in the beginning.
But after I understood the idea of the game, I somehow got addicted to it...
</P>
<P>
Well: You control a worm (such as in any Snake game) and you have to collect a number of characters (also like in any
Snake) to enter the next level. You win, if you have got the most points.
</P>
<P>
But life isn't easy due to these two things:
</P>
<P>
1. You have got an opponent (what means &quot;one&quot;? Up to three. Depending on fun (and people) they can also be
controlled by humans.). If you touch the track the opponent worm leaves behind, you loose energy points.
</P>
<P>
2. There are some walls, where you might also loose energy.
</P>
<P>
In addition there are lots of extras like e.g. extra energy, bombs (blast away the track you leave behind), track eaters
and so on.
</P>
<P>
If you got used to the game, it is funny. But those of you, who like nice graphics and fine sound, is wrong in this game.</P>
<P>
For the creative people, there is also a level editor.
