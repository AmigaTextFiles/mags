&raquo;Ruksun Software Technologies Joins Forces with Amiga
</P>
<P>
Snoqualmie, WA, August 22,2000 - Amiga Inc. is pleased to announce that it
has reached an agreement with Ruksun Software Technologies to bring its

award winning IMAP Force and Messenger Force.
</P>
<P>
Messenger Force is Ruksun's Instant Messaging client that is device
agnostic and works on all the popular hand held devices powered by Windows
CE, Psion devices using the EPOC OS and Palm hand-helds that run the Palm
OS. A soon-to-be-released version will allow Instant Messaging via cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
Messenger Force, like other popular instant messaging clients, allows for
devices to be notified when other contact list are online such that they
may communicate in real time via Instant Messages. Messenger Force is a
small footprint, comprehensive messaging product that supports
authenticated user logon, auto notification, contact list management,
status management, and access permission, as well as asynchronous and real
time messages and notifications.
</P>

IMAP Force will be the first email client for Amiga that will support the
IMAP4 protocol for online access to mail. IMAP Force is designed to allow
mobile users to quickly and selectively browse through their messages
without having to download either the large message or large attachments.
IMAP Force allows users to send mail messages via SMTP, and supports
Quoted Printable encoding and non-ASCII text in headers. IMAP Force
includes POP3 functionality allowing users to access their POP3 accounts
and to perform simple mail operations.

really exciting to be able to include their great skills and great
products in the Amiga Family,&quot; said Bill McEwen, President/CEO of Amiga,

Force and IMAP Force to Amiga. We are equally happy to see our platform
validated by a partner who has distinguished itself on other platforms. We
know that Ruksun, like our other partners, will enjoy the binary
compatibility value proposition of Amiga and continue to innovate rather
than rewriting existing applications.&quot;
