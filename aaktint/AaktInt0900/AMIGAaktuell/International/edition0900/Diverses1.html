<H2>1. Haage &amp; Partner announces StormC v4</H2>

<P>
The new dimension of programming
</P>
<P>
Dolgesheim, August 28, 2000. Last Sunday, in the sub-division of the company HAAGE&amp;PARTNER Computer GmbH in Dolgesheim,
the new StormC developers package was presented for the first time in a select circle. During the yearly summer
festival, a lot was discussed about the past and the future. Among the many guests were employees of the company
Hyperion (Heretic II, ...) and ESCENA (PowerPC-Boards), who showed enthusiasm after the presentation <BR>

</P>
<P>
The most important feature of the new developers system is the step forwards towards the new AmigaOS. At the moment
everything still runs on the Classic Amiga, and that is how it will be presented, but everything was developed
anew with easy portability in mind.
</P>
<P>
A big step towards more up-to-date system has been made through the decision to support the
GNU-Compilerin a modified version. The current Storm-Compiler is not less professional, but not easy to port to other systems.<BR>
The new StormGCC is very compatible to the StormC compiler, supports known preprocessor symbols (for instance __FUNC__),
writes in 68K as well as in PPC the Amiga Hunk-Format in object files and creates the same debug file format as StormC. The PowerPC
version of StormGCC supports the PowerOpen/WarpOS conventions.
</P>
<P>
In the new StormC the network capabilities are of very high importance. StormC now can be used by a programming team
working on one project, without problems. An important utility in this respect is
CVS Concurrent Versions System. With the aid of CVS multiple developers can work
on one project or source code at the same time, and link their changes in a controlled fashion. StormC shows in
the project version number and status of the files, and color marks files that might give problems.
</P>
<P>
The network capabilities are rounded off by the now distributed
Make. In a network, multiple computers can be used simultaneously
to compile a project. StormC finds free computers automatically, and moves compiling jobs to those. A Make Logfile
keeps track of various compiler commands, error messages, and allows for an exact error diagnosis in complex projects.
</P>
<P>
Further novelties can be found in the project management and the editor. With the aid of the global search the
entire project or all projects, including hierarchical projects can be searched with full
text search including AmigaDOS patterns. It is possible,
by double clicking the search result, to go directly to the relevant position in the source code.
</P>
<P>
The user can now create his own sections, and decide what kind of files should be put there, and how they should
be edited, shown or compiled. Sections can be sorted alphabetically and colored in different colors A helpmeet
gives extensive Online Help to StormC, GCC, AmigaOS Includes and Autodocs. A bubble-help provides basic help when required.
</P>
<P>
The new editor now also colorizes CVS-conflicts, installer- and AmigaGuide-commands according to new dictionaries.
When typing the name of known system functions, the appropriate prototype
is shown, which makes further input of parameters for these functions much
easier. The double-click on a file path (for instance in an include command) loads the file in a new . Furthermore
the keyboard layout is freely configurable.
</P>
<P>
A new addition is a program for documentation. With StormDOC
one creates ToDo-lists, bug reports, and program documentation. It keeps
track of all actions of the user, knows the various destination groups and circumstances of the list, who can all
also be configured as search criteria.
</P>
<P>
The new debugger cooperates on 68K- and PPC WarpOS programs with the StormCompiler and StormGCC. The debugging
is now no longer limited to one program - Tasks and Shared
Libraries can now also be edited step by step. When Enforcer-hits
occur, the debugger immediately shows the position of the source of evil in the source code.
</P>
<P>
All in all, StormC 4 is fully revamped and greatly enhanced tool, that will once again speed up software-development
on the Amiga, and will create it more professionally.
</P>

<P><B>Opinions</B></P>
<P>
Steffen H&auml;user of Hyperion, responsible for the conversion of Sxx for the Amiga, said about the new compiler:
&quot;The combination of the gcc code generator with StormC's advantages of the debugger, the comfortable IDE,
the MixedBinaries and the possibility to create Shared Libraries in an easy way looks like a very nice compiler
system.<BR>
The distributed-make facility to reduce compilation time and the integration of CVS into the IDE are very welcome.
We are looking forward to employing the new StormC in future projects. Adaptions of a first project from gcc to
the new StormC worked flawlessly. Support for Elate VP Code in a future version will also be very interesting to
us.&quot;
</P>
<P><B>Availability</B></P>
<P>
The price of StormC 4 will be around 500,- DM (approx. 255.10 Euros). Customers of older versions of StormC can get an update for the
price of only 198,- DM. However, the finished product will first be available in October 2000.
