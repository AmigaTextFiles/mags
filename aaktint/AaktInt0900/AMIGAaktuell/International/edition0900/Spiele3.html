<P><B>Hello, dear readers!</B></P>
<P>
In front of you is the September edition of the AMIGA aktuell International game section. After this &quot;nice&quot; summer
here in Germany we return to the real life. This also influences the games section - this month there has been more to
report than the month before. Very interesting is the news from Crystal Software to cancel all Classic-Amiga games.
Just have a look into the release list - there you can see how many games have been cancelled...
</P>
<P>
This month there are reviews and to new introductions: On one hand Pictris and on the other hand the Amiga Game Guide
CD-ROM (remark of the translator: the Amiga Game Guide CD-ROM is available in German only. So it is not included in AMIGA
aktuell International.). Both products are from APC&amp;TCP. In addition to that there the PD tests from Malte Mende. But my small job for
the PD section is cancelled due to technical reasons. But usually you get informed about the latest Aminet releases earlier
than at the end of the month in this games section.
</P>
<P>
Of course, we are still looking for someone taking over the Mac corner, since Andreas Koch cannot continue with it. Please
contact me! I am also always open for the creation of new section. But please consider, that they should not appear only
once, but on a regular base. Those, who just want to write an article, can do this, of course. Just send me an eMail.
</P>
<P>
Now, something internal: Last month I listed the news of the month before (July) instead of the news of August in the
emulator news. It seems, that no one but me noticed... This would be another plus for my &quot;20 readers theory&quot;
I mentioned some months ago. But I don't mind!
</P>
<P>
Have fun with this AMIGA aktuell International games section and it would be nice, if you sent some feedback!
</P>
<P><B>Yours,</B></P>
