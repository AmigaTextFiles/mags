Snoqualmie, WA, August 21, 2000 - Amiga (<A HREF="http://www.amiga.com">www.amiga.com</A>) has announced today
an agreement with Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ: RHAT), the leader in open source
internet infrastructure, to provide high performance multimedia for the
Linux platform. The agreement gives the Redhat.com community access to
Amiga's Software Developer Kit. Bill McEwen, Amiga President/CEO, said
that the company selected Red Hat because of its leadership and abilities
to assist in the development of the new Amiga.
</P>
<P>
&quot;The Amiga community has already created significant content including
games and exciting Java applications with the Amiga SDK. With the response
that we received from the members of the Red Hat team, they clearly
understand what the Amiga has meant to the development of personal
computer as we know it today. And more important, they are eager to
provide support and add significantly to the solid foundation we have been
developing,&quot; McEwen said.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We're excited to be working with Amiga,&quot; said Paul McNamara, VP of
Products and Platforms at Red Hat. &quot;With a multimedia consumer layer
available with Red Hat as the foundation, new markets and new users will
be able to take advantage of Linux and the software available on
Redhat.com.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;The strategic relationship and partnership with the Tao Group in Reading,
England (<A HREF="http://www.tao-group.com">www.tao-group.com</A>) that we announced at the beginning of this
year, added to this support from Red Hat, gives the New Amiga a very
exciting and real story,&quot; McEwen added.
</P>
<P>
The new Amiga SDK is the embodiment of the Amiga multimedia computing
experience. With tools, support, and exciting new applications already in
development for the new Amiga, developers can quickly begin creating
games, multimedia applications, and can use Java for even more
opportunities. With the purchase of the SDK a developer will receive free
updates for the next 12 months, and the scout level of Amiga's support
program.&laquo;
