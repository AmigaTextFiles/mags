<H2>1. The fall of Commodore from my point of view - part 11 (by Rainer Benda)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;In the last days, Christoph G&uuml;licher and Mick Hohmann turned up to work and they kept the faith for a long time. They took the trouble to front an Amiga club meeting in Marl and defend the &quot;Walker&quot;. I felt I had to show them that A.T. was on the wrong track but this was interpreted as an &quot;act of revenge&quot; at first. They said I'd speak ill of anything that came from A.T. because I had had to leave A.T. as a &quot;spurned&quot; person.
</P>
<P>
I disagreed but was too tired to talk them round. When A.T. and Escom finally went under Christoph told me that I had been right, that the management had treated them badly and good ideas were ignored. They said they could see why I thought A.T. was heading for the abyss. Gilles Bourdin, who went back to France from his job at A.T. to work for a bank, said much the same.
</P>
<P>
I started hearing a very loud deathwatch beetle on the day that Petro phoned me in Langen and told me that I should stop bagging him on the net if I valued my relationship with A.T. or A.I. This was at a time when Amiga users were desperate to believe that the new management would make the Amiga successful again (omigod, Amigans still think this way...)
</P>
<P>
I thought my opinions were based pretty squarely on experience, but after that conversation I held my tongue because I thought it would be better for the Amiga....
</P>
<P>
I learned after I left that Petro got another manager (Stefan Domeyer, who later became the boss of PIOS and now Met@box). As far as I know they didn't get along and Domeyer left Amiga Tech. and launched the &quot;PIOS One&quot; project with Dave Haynie, Doc Peter and others. This was not a success, as you may know.
Peter moved to Hildesheim but told me he didn't enjoy it because he felt that he was blamed (unfairly, he felt) for the failure of &quot;Pios One&quot;...
</P>
<P>
I put in a &quot;subsequent demand&quot; for the use of my private system which made me part of the group of creditors. A.T. wanted a settlement and I agreed, but I never got paid because 3 days later they declared themselves bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
I turned up for the creditors convention. It was supposed to be a private affair but there was so much gossip flying before the doors opened that we were all under no illusions.
</P>
<P>
Parties milling around outside included the banks, Intel, representatives of the employment exchange and a Mr. Konjevic Snr from Eagle Computing. Mr K spent some time trying to convince me that Eagle Computer was the only company that would be able to take over the Amiga remains. He told me that he had found out that Viscorp wouldn't be able to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
I listened without commenting. Mr. K detailed how his bids had been refused by the official receiver, Mr Hembach, and that he'd have to talk with him about that.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hembach arrived and Mr. K buttonholed him. Mr. H pointed out to Mr. K that Eagle Computer didn't even have 1/3 of the sum needed and asked how Mr K planned to raise the rest. Mr. K harummphed and said he had undertakings from banks and that anyway Viscorp wasn't a sound firm.
</P>
<P>
There followed a bit of head butting from both men, until Mr H put his foot down and said that it wasn't just a matter of Eagle Computer's money.  To quote Mr H: as long as I get to decide, Eagle Computer won't get the remains of Amiga Technologies. Apparently, it's just not on to contact him directly concerning a takeover. The law says he has to refuse all requests and he would refuse all further requests from Eagle Computer.
</P>
<P>
Mr. K seemed a little disappointed, but the rest of us were off to the meeting. On the table there were three big folders from creditors. Nobody from Escom's/Amiga Technologies' management was there. Amiga Technologies' assets were estimated at DEM 25.000, but there was no payout because the employees got first dibs.
</P>
<P>
As we filed out I fell into conversation with a lady from the employment exchange who had to take care of the social matters and who was confused about the procedure. A few weeks later I phoned her and asked if there was any hope... as far as she knew, Viscorp would be the successor, the employees would stay, there was a contact person in the USA but nobody in Germany had any power...... and thus it is to this day.
</P>
<P>
I busied myself in my shop again, although I've moved on from that this year. I'm still interested in Amiga related things although I don't think that the Amiga as we know it has a great future (because of, or despite, the takeover by McEwen and Co.). I think that the AmigaOS doesn't have a good or any chance of competing with modern operating systems such as Linux.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion, (if you can ever make a final conclusion):
</P>
<P>
I am certain opportunities have been missed. It's been a great achievement keeping a system alive for such a long time but there's no way of making up the time lost.
</P>
<P>
I'll continue using my Amigas until they die but being limited to one operating system doesn't appeal, and nor does spending time imagining the all-new ultimate Amiga when I can't go and buy it in the shops.
</P>
<P>
I don't feel any enmity or anger concerning Petro or other parts of A.I. or who/whatever is going to come. There are more important things in life and at a certain point all wounds get healed if you give them enough time. I simply don't equate merit with sacrifice anymore.
</P>
<P>
Someone else can step up to the plate and neglect their private life for the sake of a computer system. It's up to you to decide but I, personally, wouldn't any more. I must admit I had a different opinion when I was 16 years old, wide eyed and innocent.
</P>
<P>
Maybe the typical Amiga user is a type who finds it easy to accept this destiny. Or maybe they clutch at any straw.  I cannot answer: I looked at what was said after Commodore went bankrupt, I heard what was said about all those projects making great progress, I was gripped by the feeling that now everything would change, I wanted to believe that the latest &quot;buyers&quot; must be doing it right:  why would they spend so much money if they didn't plan to.....
Then I simply shake my head.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga users certainly didn't benefit. I wonder who else did. Maybe companies such as Amiga Int. by selling the remains, or fan articles? Developers/manufacturers of hardware for the Amiga? Or Gateway?
</P>
<P>
What's coming after the takeover by McEwen & Co.? A lengthening of the death ... or a &quot;soft&quot; transition to PC-hardware in a different package?
</P>
<P>
I doubt that the often praised &quot;Amiga feeling&quot; can be kept alive by an operating system. I'm not one of those who waited for an OS conversion for such a long time only to use Windows or Linux.
</P>
<P>
Building Amiga specific hardware is expensive - we're talking about millions of dollars. But if there's no new product then maybe there's no new business.
</P>
<P>
I cannot see any concept that could give us a real advantage...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
THE END.
