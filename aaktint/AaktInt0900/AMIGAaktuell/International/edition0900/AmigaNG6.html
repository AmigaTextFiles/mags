<P>
Mid of August, edition 3 of the Amiga World as released on the website <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com</A>
of AMIGA. It contains ideas of AMIGA employees, reports about the new technology and of partner companies with some
very interesting views. The summary of this edition has been shortened for this edition.

This time the Forword is written by Randall P. Hughes, VP Sales and Strategic Business Development, who also discribes
his curriculum vitae. As bank specialist he came to QNX via canadian banks. At QNX he became manager for sales accounting
and finally he became the regional manager of sales. There he learnt about Gateway and Amiga and after he created the
sales and finance department for the young company Thinweb Technologies Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss asked him to help
them in a leading position to get Amiga. He is co-founder of AMIGA, Inc. and so he is, as many like to say, the
&quot;Third Amiga&quot;.
</P>
<P>
He sees the current development as very successful and expects, that the Amiverse will have a similar influence on the
computer technology of today as the classic Amiga on his introduction.

<P>
AMIGA doesn't build hardware! They are a software company!
</P>
<P>
Platform independency, abstract layers, virtual processors, everything is software!
</P>
<P>
However, allow me a remark: If there will be an Amiga computer at all, there has to be ToDo book for hardware
- rules, what they will be and what will be in them. Ideally someone with knowledge, experience and visions should
continue the philosophy,  which originally made the experiences with this computer wonderful.
</P>
<P>
Dean Brown came to Amiga by other computers in an early stage and developped the first peripheral devices (memory expansions)
for the Amiga 1000 and founded his company DKB software. In 1997 DKB hat to end their activities. Due to his continuing
activities for the Amiga he got in touch with Fleecy Moss and they found, that they have many things in common. So it was
no surprise, that Fleecy asked Dean to work for Amino/Amiga. After the first producsts of AMIGA have been created and
developped, Dean was offered a fulltime job and since June 5th, Dean Brown is part of the team. His position is director
of hardware.
</P>
<P>
Dean describes his work, that he first has to develop a test platform, which is for the internal software teams. The
result will be very similar to todays' computers. This or similar platforms will be made available to the hardware
partners as a reference system. As time continues a new architecture can be expected, which considers the problems
of the current computers. Things, which cannot be brought in order with unflexible operating systems.
</P>
<P>
It is Dean Brown's opinion, that a problem of the current computers is, that all jobs have to be fulfilled by a central
processor and that a doubled clock frequency results in a speed increase of approx. 20%, because the data cannot be
moved with the required speed. &quot;Distributed processing is where I want to go.&quot; And he said, that Tao solved a
lot of problems on this subject. While loading the virtual processor translates the VP code into native code, which means,
that the processor is working on the code, which translator code has been used. If there is a multi-processor system,
the code is running on the processor, which is best suitable to run the code. This decision is made during loading.
In addition to that data have to be run a mulitple times to execute an action, if the system has one central processor.
In Tao's distributed system you only have to transmit the data. This allows the use of smaller, cheaper processors, which
results in more power than one &quot;fast&quot; CPU would have.
</P>
<P>
Distributed processing is a similar philosophy as it is with the classic Amiga and its custom chips, but there are basic
differences. The custom chips have been very specialized and tightly glued to the operating system. This is why every hardware
change required a re-write of the OS. This and because Commodore supported code access on the hardware and ordered, that
each licenced program had to run on any OS version, the classic Amiga was unable to access newer technologies.
</P>
<P>
Dean Brown is passionately working on a &quot;backward compatibility&quot;, which is based on the methodic of abstract
layers, which are the center of the new architecture. &quot;Applications, which try to go around those layers will be
aborted by definition.&quot;, said Dean.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the first hardware is ready, which allows the new operating system to run natively, there will be another
machine on the same table, which has an absolutely incompatible hardware, but both are running the same OS.
Applications will be tested on both machines. If they run on both without colliding with the hardware you know, that
it is an OS-legal piece of software.

<P>
Amiga World interviewed Markus Nerding, the speaker and webmaster of Haage &amp; Partner. This is a summary of his answers.
</P>
<P>
The preparations for a new generation of H&amp;P products began two years ago. This is why the company will have a leading position
when the new digital equipment of Amiga (Digital Environment), named &quot;Ami&quot; will be available.
</P>
<P>
The programmers from H&amp;P welcome the unique virtual processor, which will be the heart of Ami. The programmer no longer
needs to care about the problems of a specific CPU, because his binary program will be able to run on a number of computer
platforms - according to last counting it's 40. Additional power of the Ami are its quick Java-installation and its incredible
low size.
</P>
<P>
The first software from Haage &amp; Partner for the new Amiga will be StormC, a complete development equipment for software.
The current version for the classic Amiga already shows into this direction with various independant components, which
communicate via an ARexx interface.
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, nearly every components of StormC have been re-designed to make them platform independant, but
also independant from a graphical user interface (GUI). Haage &amp; Partner currently uses their own set of BOOPSI add-ons
(the &quot;Storm Wizard GUI Development System&quot;). This is why the Storm IDE (Integrated Development Environment) can
easily be ported to other platforms.
</P>
<P>
Another product which is being prepared is StormREXX, H&amp;P's own ARexx version, because the original could not easily
be ported to a planned AmigaOS for PowerPC processors. StormREXX is compatible with the original ARexx and has some
object oriented add-ons. &quot;We are working to finalize the project, so StormREXX will run on Ami, soon&quot;, Markus said.
</P>
<P>
After completing the developer projects Haage &amp; Partner will start to port the classic applications: The text processing
software &quot;Amiga Writer&quot; (currently version 2.2) and the graphics processor and painting program &quot;ArtEffect&quot;
(currently version 4.0). Two years ago they began thinking about the rework of both programs. They are written completely in
C or C++, so the main job will be to change the GUI system. Depending on the characteristics of Ami and its tools, this can
take three to six months for each product.
</P>
<P>
Markus Nerding confirmed, that Haage &amp; Partner are interested in developing completely new software. The first steps
depend on which software will be made available for the new system from other companies.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the plans for porting WarpOS and PPC-boards regarding the new Amiga DE Nerding said, that AMIGA/Tao Group have
not made a decision, how it could be done best. But if Tao made a Linux-PPC-version, it should not be a problem to port
it on the PPC-Amiga also.
</P>
<P>
Markus added regarding the emulation of the old AmigaOS on the new Amiga DE, that there were various possibilities,
one of them would be an &quot;abstracted&quot; emulation like UAE, which is in an experimental phase from AMIGA Inc.
Another possibility was a more native emulation below the Amiga environment. H&amp;P is cooperating tightly with AMIGA Inc.
to find the best solution in this important part.
</P>
<P>
Nerding sees a number of possibilites for upgrades of the classic AmigaOS. It might not be clear for the public, but the
development of the classic AmigaOS never stopped. &quot;Currently we are completing the development of the second edition
of the BoingBag, which will contain some more features, more bugfixing and maybe some new components.&quot; Most of it is
in beta tests, the release can be expected, soon.

</TABLE>
<P>
If your base is the Amiga community, certain concepts of thinking are created. One of this concepts is the idea of sharing,
the common use. The word &quot;Amiga&quot; is nearly a synonym for things like freeware, shareware and giftware. The
Amiga community owns a large amount of software the source for this treasure is the Aminet. Without any doubt, this facility
is one of important reasons for the surviving of the Amiga as unique platform.
</P>
<P>
Many programmers write their software for the straight and elegant AmigaOS just for fun and only, &quot;because they can
do it&quot;. Due to this selfless work the Aminet became the sheet anchor for the Amiga community.
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise, that AMIGA Inc wants to use this power for the future. This can be achieved by making parts of the new
Amiga Digital Environment, Open Source (or AmiOpen, what will be the future name) for the Amiverse. It is expected that
this will create innovations and allow the developers to create add-ons changes or improvements of the Amivers,
&quot;because they can do it&quot;.
</P>
<P>
AmiOpen differs from the Linux modell of &quot;free software&quot; in that way, that AMIGA Inc. will add Open Source to
commercial ownership. Most utilities, we require as Digital Environment are Open Source and can be ported easily. So
Amiga DE programmers get a big bunch of experiences.
</P>
<P>
The work for the AmiOpen project is running fine. Those, who want to know, what is already available, can get this
informations from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.amiga.com/developers">ftp.amiga.com/developers</A>. Some ported software can be
transferred to that server.
</P>
<P>
Only the core features of the Amiverse are edited from AMIGA internaly and will not be AmiOpen. The additional things
like tools, drivers, editors, interface layers and more can be improved or developed by the AmiOpen community without
problems.
</P>
<P>
For support AMIGA created initatives, the first one is an open mailing list for developers at <A HREF="mailto:open-request@amiga.com.">open-request@amiga.com</A>.
Soon, there will be a bulletin board news system. Other things like e.g. eMail support (by a staff of technicians in
various time zones around the world), CVS, Bugzilla and developer specific informations, will be available as time
goes by.
</P>
<P>
The web-based support is also to target the commercial developers.
</P>
<P>
AMIGA hopes, that the mixture of Open Source and commercial aspect allows it to fulfill &quot;the dream&quot; everyone
dreamed, who didn't lose their faith during all the years.

<P>
A report about the AmiWest 2000. Here you will only find the things of common interest.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Anti Gravity in California bought the rights on the BoXeR and plans a new line of the classic Amiga architecture
with a far improved hardware design. Joe Torre, previously at Amiga/Gateway was hired from Anti Gravity, some time ago.
A much improved and faster Amiga platform for those, who work with the current architecture seems to be much more likely.
</P>
<P>
On his speech, Bill McEwen mentioned, that the Amiga SDK sold much better than expected. Amiga is linked to &quot;every
leading company for games out there&quot; and many of them already own the SDK.
</P>
<P>
The release of the Amiga One, there Amiga reference platform of the next generation is expected for this December.
Dean Brown creates the drafts for various sample devices, which serve third parties as reference for their products.
</P>
<P>
A version of the SDK for Windows will be sold next month (in a new, nice box).
</P>
<P>
The problem with the SDK licence was also mentioned (s. <A HREF="../edition0800/AmigaNG3.html">edition 0800 of Amiga Aktuell International</A>).
In addition to that Bill McEwen said, that for certificating a product, the concerted marketing and for the offical Amiga
badge a fee of 5% or just US-$1.50 per sold unit had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
Some more goodies: From next week on (after the AmiWest) Red Hat sells the SDK. Sun has begun to use Amiga software to
demonstrate Java examples. AMIGA will go to stock. Paul Nolan (Author of PhotoGenics) is working for AMIGA in the department
for user interface on a project base. AMIGA will offer cheap promotional articles to user groups. A touchscreen unit
builty by ARM (and developped by Mick Tinker) was shown and showed Amiga/Elate in native mode.
</P>
<P>
Very good news for todays developers: For the backward compatibility of the classic Amiga the Amiga DE will have an
emulation layer. Although UAE has also been ported to the new Amiga DE, but the emulation layer is a much more transparent
method for running current Amiga applications on the Amiga DE.

<P>
If you ask an honest graphics developer, who's the king under the 3D graphics programmer interfaces, it is very like he
would say &quot;Mesa&quot;. Based on the OpenGL-3D library from Silicon Graphics the Mesa-3D library offers the highest
levels of acceptance, compatibility and power on a large number of platforms.
</P>
<P>
AMIGA Inc. already uses the large number of features from Mesa for developing the 3D-API (Application Programming Interface)
for the next generation Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Gustavson, AMIGA's manager of 3D-development says, that Mesa was &quot;one of the most exciting APIs that exist&quot;.
And he adds &quot;the fact, that most companies use OpenGL (or something similar) is one of the reasons AMIGA chose Mesa).&quot;
</P>
<P>
This is confirmed by John Carmack from id software, a living legend in the development of video games, who made something
completely new when creating 3D titles like Wolfenstein 3D and Quake. Carmack is a very strong supporter of alternatives
to Microsofts Direct3D (a proprietary, Windows-Only-API) and was very amused about the inefficiency of Direct3D compared
to OpenGL.
</P>
<P>
Carmack wrote a program, which called Direct3D to call a simple 3D operation. Then he wrote a program, which called OpenGL
to do the same. The Direct3D program was a various times larger as well as in form as in the function than the OpenGL
program. These are the advantages of Mesa.
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are difficulties when porting programs, which do not use OpenGL or Mesa. Even if there are similarities
between Mesa and Direct3D, there porting from Direct3D is much more complicated from OpenGL.
</P>
<P>
Even programmers, who require inline-assembler for their special system have to port these programs to VP. Even if this is
not very easy, the advantages of VP are obvious: It is the friendliest assembler language you can meet and it runs everywhere
the Amiga operating environment runs on.
</P>
<P>
Jonas Gustavsson points on the attraction of Amiga to game developers, especially those, who use OpenGL or Mesa
for their programming. &quot;The complete method of VP technology (compile once and it runs everywhere) is quite practically,
but it is a fact, that desktop PCs cannot win against the consoles. Game manufacturer hesistate more and more to produce
their games for computers instead for consoles. Ami (the short name for the new digital Amiga environment [Amiga Digital
Environment]) and Mesa offer the solution for the developers, so they just write the game for Ami and ship one CD or DVD,
which contains the hoste or non-hosted version of the game. The user loads the game as usual.&quot;
</P>
<P>
This access can be used for any supported platform - hosted platforms like Linux, Windows and WarpOS/classic Amiga or
non-hosted platforms like x86, PowerPC, Mips, Sparc etc. It is very likely, that this will be expanded to the video
games consoles, so the player just needs one binary file for all of them.
</P>
<P>
While additional graphical interfaces like e.g. Renderware will be available for the Amiga in future, the Mesa library
for the next generation Amiga will step into the betatest phase, soon. Amiga developers can expect the 3D-realisation
as part of the next Software Development Kit.

</TABLE>
<P>
The new Amiga Digital Environment (DE), codenamed Ami (pronounced Amie) is much more than an operating system. It is hardware
abstraction, persistence, organization, multimedia, connectivity and user experience seamlessly brought together in a distributed
service architecture.
</P>
<P>
It is best to look at the Amiga DE as a set of three layers. The lowest level is the Physical Layer and it is where the set of hardware
resources can be found. This Physical Layer can contain anything from processors to storage devices, graphics and audio components to
speakers, memory to printers, both local and remote, and on single or multiple devices.
</P>
<P>
On top of the Physical Layer, and responsible for abstracting that layer, comes the Amiga Foundation Layer, or AFL.  Part of the AFL is
the intent JTE (Java Technology Edition) from the Tao Group. The intent JTE consists of the Elate RTOS (Real Time Operating System), the
AVE (Audio Visual Environment) and the J-Engine; a sun certified personal Java JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
</P>
<P>
AMIGA is currently busy enhancing and expanding the AFL, examples being the Amiga Object Model (AOM) and a port of the 3D graphics
library, Mesa-a cooperative venture between Amiga and Hyperion Software. Amiga is also working on a variety of services for the AFL,
which include persistence, query, set and immigration. In addition, Amiga is working on a revolutionary common language that unites
command line, scripting, control and serious application development.
</P>
<P>
All of these are necessary in order to allow for the third layer to exist; that third layer is the Amiverse. The Amiverse is a logical
set of objects that has no knowledge of the quantity, quality or location of the hardware on which it exists. An Amiverse can exist on a
single digital device, it can share a digital device or it can be spread across many digital devices. An Amiverse is first inflated and
then users enter it. Once within the Amiverse, user can manipulate existing objects, produce and consume digital content, visit other
Amiverses, import and export objects, add objects and services to the Amiverse and create organization and meaning.
</P>
<P>
The Amiverse becomes a home for elements from the Digital Content Universe: that total set of digital audio, video, graphics, text,
applications, and services that are growing at an exponential rate in the world today. The Amiverse will connect and take advantage of
all this emerging digital technology and put it at the users command.
</P>
<P>
The traditional computing model was computer and application-centric, with Digital Content relegated to data that sat on the
periphery. The Amiga Digital Environment puts the Digital Content Universe at the center, with the many digital devices surrounding
it. These devices provide the vehicles, which give access to that Digital Content Universe. In this way, activity and task are elevated
to their correct position at the center of the human-machine equation instead of the user having to be slave to application and OS
architectural decisions. Users will no longer have to think like machines to access and use digital content.
