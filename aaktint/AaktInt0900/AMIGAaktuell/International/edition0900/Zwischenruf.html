<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>Midsummer night dreams</B></P>
<P>
Recently in Germany, UMTS licences were auctioned for nearly 100 Billion DEM (approx. 51.02 Billion Euros) to six future owners of the shiny new media future.
</P>
<P>
Whether the price the companies had to pay is too low, too high or just right is quite irrelevant. Auctioneer Scheuerle sold, in a stylish manner, part of our common heritage (the frequencies) to the highest bidder, normal behaviour for an auctioneer. The winning bidders were ready to pony up what was needed to win the licences and safeguard their business interests.
</P>
<P>
The economists were thrilled, sagely reminding each other that the price of any product is what the customer agrees to pay. A typical fair free market deal, then? But maybe rational economics  went out the window, and a bunch of fanatics, swayed by the excitement of it all, paid way over the odds for a load of old rope.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of overpriced old rope, a software company from Redmond, USA, recently presented its idea of a future programming platform. This had many similarities to the VP structure favored by Amiga.
</P>
<P>
It seems there could be a auction looming for the hearts and minds of potential consumers/customers. And if the Amiga vision fails to grab hearts and minds (one of the things they have done well over the years) and activate bidding fingers, MS could win by applying large dollops of cash.
</P>
<P>
Amiga can't develop &quot;just&quot; an operating system. The Amiga is about sharing a vision with its users, a technically better vision.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has many more users, even if a number of them are quite naive PC users. Linux is still not user friendly enough to join the game and win worthwhile market share.
</P>
<P>
What does Amiga do? Or better: what does Amiga WANT to do? News about partnerships with other (successful) companies seems to miss the point.
</P>
<P>
Amiga diehards are saying: The developer version of the new AmigaOE is available. A developer machine (d'Amiga) is (will be soon) available. Partnerships with other companies have been made and announced.
</P>
<P>
There's only one piece missing: the customer. We can only hope  that Amiga can woo those rare creatures with the sort of hard- and software they will load up the plastic for.
</P>
<P>
And that they launch this new Amiga with a huge bang: Greetings, world, here's the new Amiga, trailing dry ice and laser lights as it swoops onto the stage of the opera house in Frankfurt while running Quake, doing special effects for the next Starwars instalment and making popcorn on the microwave...
</P>
<P>
And Bruce Willis (proclaiming an imminent Armageddon for other platforms) will talk it in. It would be much better than Karl Moik with his &quot;Musikantenstadl&quot; (remark of the translator: a folk music show).
</P>
<P>
See you next time and ....
</P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT> ....live long and prosper !!</P>
