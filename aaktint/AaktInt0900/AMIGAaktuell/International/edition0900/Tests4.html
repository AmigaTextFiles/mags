<H2>4. Progress report: Moving an A4000 into an RBM-Tower (by Dirk Hase)</H2>
<P>
Probably every A4000 desktop user has dreamed about putting the motherboard and all those other boards into a new home, for many reasons: lack of space, thermal problems, or just for a good look.
</P>
<P>
I plead the first three reasons: my 4000 was a bare bones affair, no cover, cos my harddisk didn't fit unless it was nude. And too many fans are only just enough to solve the thermal problems a sexy CyberstormPPC generates, more on this later.
</P>
<P>
I don't want to be accused of doing a bit of marketing on the side but the RBM tower seemed the best solution for me. Couldn't get past the seven Zorro slots and five 5.25 inch slots.
Especially when I looked at other tower systems and in a fit of madness even considered a PC tower...
But I soon rejected the rest - as far as I could tell, if it was easy it wouldn't be stable, if it was stable it would be a pain to set up. So I ordered the RBM tower from my dealer.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks it arrived and I could begin. When I had taken everything apart it looked pretty simple, just had to bung in the motherboard, CyberstormPPC, harddisk, floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, I/O board, video grabber and, of course, the Zorro board.

</P>
<P>
I took it a step at a time.
</P>
<P><B>Motherboard, Zorroboard and processor board:</B></P>
<P>
The motherboard has to be fixed on the screening metal sheet with 6 screws. Then you have to decide on how many spacers you need to keep your mobo away from excessive voltage, but don't stop there, have a thought for the processor board and the Zorro board. In technical terms, get some extra "spacers" because the ones that come with the tower don't suffice.
</P>
<P><B>Hard disk and floppy drive:</B></P>
<P>
Time to pop in the harddisk. Pity that the 3.5 inch frame for the harddisk and the floppy drive doesn't fit into its space in the tower if your CyberstormPPC is equipped with 128 MB of RAM.
I had to use brute force to reshape the frame so that there was enough space for the RAM, but even brute force couldn't squeeze the harddisk in and I had to use a 5.25 inch slot...but if you don't have a slim line floppy drive (like me) you have to use the next 5.25 inch slot. RBM seems to be aware of this scenario cos they included an adapter which solved the problem.
Being a fundamentally cool dude I equipped the reshaped 3.5 inch metal sheet with a fan to waft a breeze over the EDO elements, which are known to generate a certain amount of heat. My Cybervision PPC slipped into place like an I love you virus into MS Outlook.
It was time to test the system. Ummm....Everything worked fine.
</P>
<P>
I installed the CD-ROM drive. Ummm....Everything worked fine. So simple there are no problems to  report.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important details:
</P>
<P><B>Cool fanmail:</B></P>
<P>
The Cyberstorm PPC should be equipped with at least one fan per processor and an additional fan for the RAM elements. Furthermore you should put a small cooling plate and a small fan on top of the Cybervision PPC Permedia 2 because it can become pretty hot.
I also installed a box fan at the back of the tower. It blows the warm air out of the computer right behind my desk, a help but not the complete solution to chilly late night sessions. In addition, I put a very thin fan onto my harddisk which sits in the
uppermost slot. I'm not one to skimp on cooling.
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion:</B></P>
<P>
Not exactly plug and play but I didn't regret buying this tower. I still have Zorro slots empty after adding a CD burner and a frame for removable harddisks.
</P>
<P>
The tower is a nice piece of hardware which I can recommend. The price might deter but I think it's worth it.
