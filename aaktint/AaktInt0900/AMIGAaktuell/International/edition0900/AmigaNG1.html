<H2>1. New Executive Update from AMIGA president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P>
&raquo;August 8, 2000 - Greetings to the Global Amiga Family</P>
<P>
It has been a hectic several weeks, and we are moving even faster this
week.
<P>
There will be some new announcements in the next few days that should be
of interest to everyone as we work hard to expand the members of the Amiga
family.
<P>
I would like to say a big "Thank You" to everyone who attended the show in
Sacramento California, and another special thank you to John and Jan
Zacharius and the rest of the SACC team.  They did a great job.
<P>
I am writing this letter as a quick answer to some questions that I have
received in the last 48 hours.
<P>
As mentioned before, if you hear something that you need to confirm,
ask.  Every member of the Amiga team is more than willing to answer
questions. It gets somewhat tiresome to constantly get rumors sent to us
after they have been out there for several days or even weeks.
<P>
Here are answers to two rumors that need to be addressed immediately:
</P>
<P>
<I>
1.      Once you sell the remaining A1200's you are pulling out of Germany.</I>
<P><B>
Answer:  No.  We have no plans of pulling out of Germany.  In fact we are
looking at ways to increase our presence in all of Europe, Asia, South
America, and even here in North America.  There are several ideas on the
table, and even some names have been attached to the ideas.  There will
more information available when we are ready to share the plans.
<P>
We are certainly not going to disregard the business in these markets.  We
are a growing company and very excited about the future.</B>
<P>
<I>
2.      You are going to begin selling new A4000's and there are already 1,000
of these new A4000's being built.</I>
<P><B>
Answer:  Who came up with this one?  There is no manufacturing of any
Amiga except the new desktop, notebook, and handheld in the works.</B>
<P>
I have asked before, and now I will ask again, please stop these
rumors.  If you hear one, contact any member of the Amiga Team directly,
and we will answer you.
<P>
Thank you for your continued support.
<P>
Kindest regards,

Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga Team
