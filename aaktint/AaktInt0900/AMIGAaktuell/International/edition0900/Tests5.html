<H2>5. Progress report: &raquo;Foreign Language Master&laquo; (by Gernod Schomberg)</H2>
<P>
Occasionally I translate texts from English to German and from German to English. My knowledge of the English language (I'm German) is not bad, but I still need a good dictionary with a large vocabulary and as many examples as possible of English idiom.
</P>
<P>
The program FLM (Foreign Language Master) has been around for quite a while but I only stumbled over it recently. The program's author is Denis Unger, <A HREF="mailto:flmdic@gmx.de">flmdic@gmx.de</A>,
homepage <A HREF="http://dictionary.notrix.de" TARGET="_top">http://dictionary.notrix.de</A>
</P>
<P>
I've been using it for a few weeks on my A4000T, 25 MHz, 2 + 16 MBytes RAM.
</P>
<P>
The unregistered version has some restrictions: most importantly, the super dictionaries (with more than 200 000 entries) cannot be used and you can't create your own dictionaries. Not to mention the nag requester that pops up at start and end of the program.
I downloaded the program and liked it enough to shell out the DM 25.- (appr. 13 Euro) to register it.
</P>
<P>
Installation was simple via the Amiga installer. The program is set up in the language of your choice (built-in German, catalogs for English and French) in the specified directory. You can do an easy manual install as well.
</P>
<P>
Along with the main program, several utilities are installed. The one I found most useful was FLMconv, which lets you create your own dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
The download files contain only the simple dictionaries, you have to download the really big ones from Denis Unger's homepage. There is all sorts of stuff there, and even more on Aminet: dictionary files in several different languages, lists of licence plates, telephone area codes and postal zip codes (for Germany or German-speaking countries).
</P>
<P>
Click on the FLM icon and a small window opens. Program functions are accessed with menus.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The program runs in a spare 120 KBytes, but chomps more memory to load dictionary files. Putting these files in RAM speeds everything up, at the cost of a few MBytes, but the memory challenged can set up a 20 KByte scan buffer for each active dictionary file, which is nearly as fast as a RAM load.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
I mostly use the English&lt;-&gt;German super dictionaries which contain about 200 000 words. They are almost as extensive as my &quot;paper&quot;-dictionary, but the latter has a better range of phrases.
FLM offers a simple word search for the language combinations you have selected in the program preferences. Entering a search word pops up a split screen. On the left, matches of the search word are shown; on the right a translation to the other language (more than one if there are several possibilities).
</P>
<P>
You can enter the exact spelling, part of a word, or use wildcards to refine your search. All active dictionary files are searched.
</P>
<P>
You can also run the Thesaurus, which opens input windows for either language. Type in a word and up comes a screed of choices in the other language, just like a normal thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
Then you really get the benefit of the computer revolution: If you click on one of these alternatives, a reverse thesaurus search will be done in the other screen, with results in your own language. Try doing that with a paper thesaurus! I use this feature a lot because it gives a much better idea of whether a word is suitable.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/FLMThes.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/FLMThes.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="46" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
In your spare time, you might like to try the training mode.  Random words are selected from an assortment of prepared files and you have to type in the translation. You only get a &quot;Correct&quot; if your answer is in the active files of the other language. A good way to keep up and improve your fluency.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/FLMUnrVerb.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/FLMUnrVerb.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="46" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
One such specialist area is irregular verbs. The distribution includes irregular verb files, and you can extend the set using formatted but not converted ASCII files.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/FLMVokLlern.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/FLMVokLlern.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="46" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The FLMconv utility lets you create your own dictionaries from any ASCII files. The super dictionaries are extensive, but there will always be technical terms and jargon that need to be taken care of with specialist dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
For ease of use an ARexx port has been implemented with several commands. Via ARexx, FLM can be started as a commodity and wait in the background until it is called by a key combination. Only the pure translator function is controlled, so I prefer to call FLM from HotBarII (a PopUp-menu utility).
</P>
<P>
The ARexx port offers the possibility of dumping translation jobs straight into text processors. There are scripts for EDward, GoldED and FinalWriter. Not completely straightforward tho - FLM in automatic mode only uses the first word in the thesaurus list. You can go into selection mode, but on my computer this was quite confusing because it opened a confetti-like shower of windows.
</P>
<P>
There is a script for automatic translation, but Denis Unger says
it is experimental, and not even up to the flaky quality of Internet translation servers like Babelfish. He welcomes any ideas for improvements and plans to put more work into improving the grammar of the translations.
</P>
<P>
Because the FLM search algorithm is so fast, Denis has used the program as a file catalogue as well. Scripts for this purpose are included - I can report that creating the directory and file catalogue of an Aminet CD was done in not more than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
If there is any fly in the FLM ointment it is the uncustomisable screen. Only the relation of the parts of the output windows to each other may be changed and stored. You have no control over where the FLM window opens: on my screen always 10 pixels from the left and 50 pixels from the upper screen border. The position and the size of the output window are effectively fixed - modifications are possible, but the program does not memorize the new positions.
</P>
<P>
I have had no regrets over paying the shareware fee. FLM saves me a lot of leafing through my dictionaries. I'd rate the program as &quot;Highly Recommended&quot;.
