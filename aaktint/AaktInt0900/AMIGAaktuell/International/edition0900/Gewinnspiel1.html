Some participants commented the question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Krister S. Skrtic is for the support of well-known software manufacturers:
&raquo;Hope that this new Amiga will have the amigafeeling the classed had all
this years but uptodate. I really love my miggy and hope that this new
thing is going to be asskicking. I hope that it comes soon and that many
program houses like macromedia and adobe make their programs for this (I
hope) wonderful machine.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Hummel thinks about the situation like this: &raquo;A new Amiga... That nearly sounds too good to be true! The last
Amiga prototype to look at was shown in 1996 during the Escom ages and now, nearly 5 years later, a new computer, that will
bear the name &quot;Amiga&quot; might be presented to the computer world. I still haven't made up my mind, yet. Will the
new machine have the &quot;Look 'n' Feel&quot; of our classic Amiga? Will it be as innovative as the A1000 was at its time?
And does a new Amiga have a chance on the market dominated by IBM-compatible computers?
But there is just one way and that is to follow an old Amiga tradition:
Waiting, waiting, waiting! Quite many things were shown as prototypes just to not be released. But one thing seems to be
different: Those things announced by McEwen really happened! So the chances for a release of the Amiga One are not tooooo
bad! I would be happy about it in any case.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Dirk Wenk is uncertain: &raquo;To make a statement, if a good computer can be put on the market in this short time is
very difficult. Because there are not enough informations about the features resp. the power of the computer and what
e.g. those Amiga-non-standard-components are supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
But one thing should be clear to all of you - it can happen, that the AmigaOne has an x86 processor.
But I don't want to tempt fate :), I would like an Amiga One with a StrongArm or PowerPC-CUP. In addition to that a
powerful Matrox-3DFx-board &gt;64 MB RAM + &gt;20GB hard disk and of course a common DVD drive...for approx. 2000 DEM
(approx. 1020 Euros) would be more than fine. :)
And if then the mentioned Amiga-Classic-integration comes, which is supposed to be no emulation, I would be more than
happy! =)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Siegfried Pust reminds, that new Amigas were announced in the past more than once: &raquo;I hope, that Bill can keep his
schedule and that we can see the new Amiga in the 4th quarter of 2000 or in the 1st quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Because we Amiga got too many promisses for a new Amiga, which was never released. I hope, that Bill does it better.
I don't want to read resp. hear about promissed new Amigas, which will never come.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Denis Zwornarz doesn't believe in a release on time and answers &quot;(Sadly) No. It would be nice, but I believe it,
when the box is on my writing table.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolf Zimmer answers with &raquo;Yes. Because if they don't, Amiga Inc. has to swap to a different product, e.g. bulldozers,
because they will be unable to sell any computer. The faith would be gone and so were the customers.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Harald Nilgen wishes a low price: &raquo;I really hope, that the new Amiga (&quot;AmigaOne&quot;) comes late this year
resp. early next year. It should have a good price-performance-ration, or it will not become the hit, especially when
you consider, that on the PC-side the computers become cheaper and cheaper and the processors faster and faster.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg is optimistic: &raquo;My opinion (and hope): Even if the new devices will be equipped with
several special chips they fundamentally are machines of the current state
of art. With these the succession of generations was quite fast, and that
was not just a question of inserting a faster processor. Other ICs had as
well to be fitted for the higher power and therefore certaintainly new
board layouts were needed. So this shouldn't be an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
And because at AMIGA Inc. there are businessmen, too, who have their saying,
they will not want to have their XMas sale spoiled. By all means I start
saving for my Christmas present!

Even if the new AmigaOE in the version 1.0 will have a few glitches, this
should not upsAet my joy, the next update is quite sure :-)&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Result:</B></P>
<P>
The motto is optimism: A clear majority of the participants believes, that the &raquo;Amiga One&laquo; will be released
latest early 2001. If this was true, the (meanwhile not all too) new Amiga management needed just one year to put the
Amiga successor on the market. In a few months we will now, if they are able to keep their schedule.
