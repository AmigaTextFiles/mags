Step after step towards the AmigaNG
</P>
<P>
Recently AMIGA made an agreement, which intend the development of a version of the new Amiga operating system for the
devices of the Amercian company Infomedia Network, Inc. This agreement is the first of its kind and shows, that even
before the release of &quot;Ami&quot; there is an interest in this development.
</P>
<P>
For some Amiga users this might be a fault, that the devices of Infomedia Network are interactive Set-Top boxes, a
word, which is not remembered positive since VIScorp. But the user should consider these three things:
<OL>
<LI> Set-Top boxes are just one area of the new OS among many.</LI>
<LI> Many experts see a good future for Set-Top boxes.</LI>
<LI> Every device on which &quot;Ami&quot; runs makes the new system stronger. Because due to its hardware independency
on binary level it will be possible to run software, which was developped e.g. for the &quot;Amiga One&quot; on the
Set-Top boxes from Infomedia Network - if the programmer wanted to or unconciously made this impossible. Because an
application, which requires 64 MByte RAM, will not be able to run on devices with only 32 MByte RAM - but what else is new.
</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
So, another step has been made. Now AMIGA has to see they get more hardware manufacturer for their plans.
This might be not too easy during the development phase, but at least after the new OS has been released, it should
no longer be difficult to convince potential OEM users - always based on the premise, that the operating system can
do what AMIGA and Tao Group promiss.
</P>
<P>
Also important for AMIGA is to get the software manufacturers, which have not been present on the Amiga market, to
write software for the OS. Ruksun Software Technologies can only be a beginning.
</P>
<P>
A tactical masterpiece - maybe if its unknown - AMIGA did when marketing the Software Developer's Kit by Red Hat.
The desired press release suggerates the readers, which might also include various Linux programmers, it was mainly
an application layer for exactely this OS. But who develops with the SDK gets software, which doesn't only run on the
hosted &quot;Ami&quot; version, but also on the other versions of the new Amiga operating system. That means: If this
version of the AmigaNG-OS becomes the standard on Linux, at the same time this means the breakthrough for the AmigaNG.
</P>
<P>
So let's wait and see, which partners AMIGA will present during the next weeks.
