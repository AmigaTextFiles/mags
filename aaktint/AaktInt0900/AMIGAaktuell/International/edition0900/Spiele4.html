<LI> Crystal Software cancels all Classic Amiga games
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It seems, that this news on the home page from Crystal Software was not noticed by many people due to the silly season.
In detail this means, that more than 10 announced games have been canceled. Just have a look into the release list and
you will see what I am talking about. A small back door was left open by Crystal Software: They still want to support
the new Amiga.
