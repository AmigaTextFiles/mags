PFM (Personal Fonts Maker) and ColorType are two programs which can be used
for creating and editing Amiga bitmap fonts. The programs are several years
old now and can be downloaded freely from Aminet now. So if you always
wanted to have colored or nicely antialiased Workbench fonts you can now
create them with ColorType.
</P>
<P>
Some users might wonder why both programs are being tested because ColorType
is the successor of PFM. That's correct, but there are some features and
additional programs that are not included in Colortype (anymore).
</P>
<P>
Let's begin with the Personal Fonts Maker:
Once ('92) I paid DEM 120,- (approx. 125 Euros) for the program and got three disks and a
manual with 340 pages in a folder. I'd call it very decent and exemplary.
Well, the first positive surprise when unpacking the Aminet archive was
that the whole manual is provided in AmigaGuide format - but only in
English. Anyway: thanks to Cloanto for converting the whole stuff! All
the pictures are missing but now all references are now links you can
click on (and there are many of them!).
</P>
<P>
PFM needn't be installed; after unarchiving all programs can be launched
immediately. But looking at the OS2.0 icons gives a hint concerning the
fairly program. And that's how the 4 color screen presents itself and this
cannot be changed. The menu and the dialog are also old styled. Only the
3D buttons on the screen are a small pleasure for your eye.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/PFM.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/PFM.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="55" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Despite the optical weaknesses the program offers lots of features for
editing b/w fonts. The most important tools such as zooming, moving,
mirroring, copying, undo etc. can be chosen by clicking at the 3D buttons.
For drawing there's only a free hand tool.
</P>
<P>
The area above enables you to choose the character and to change  common
settings concerning the current character. In detail that means width,
spacing and kerning. Unfortunately, the character's height cannot be
altered afterwards. Only when reloading the font you can change the size.
</P>
<P>
Most of the screen is used by showing the characters, of course. The
drawing area accepts both mouse buttons. The left one is used for drawing
and the right one for erasing. This way detail work and corrections on
single characters can be done easily. When creating a new character for
small movable triangles at the left border shell help you not to lose your
bearings. They mark the base line, upper and lower lenght, height of the
fonts or similar things.
</P>
<P>
If you plan to change more than one character or even all the characters
then it's the menus' turn. On the one hand you can let the brush menu help
you that PPaint users should be very familiar with and on the other hand
there's the macro menu. If you now think that you have to go through all
the macros with its partially cryptic names in order to get good results
is totally wrong. There's a macro recorder which records all the user's
actions. The final macro can be used once for single characters or several
times for a particular region. Nothing is easier...
</P>
<P>
Most of the features mentioned above can also be found in ColorType and
have been improved or simplyfied. So now let's have a look at the more
interesting features of PFM. There are several features and especially
additional programs that can send the created fonts to a printer. It seems
that this was planned for needle printers only because nearly all fonts
coming with the archive have a size of 24. So if you're using a printer
which supports software fonts you can easily add a Euro symbol.
</P>
<P>
I tested this feature with three different printers: there were no
problems with my Epson needle printer (LQ500) and the 24 pixel fonts
are printed as fast as the integrated fonts. It probably won't work with
newer printers because it didn't work with my HP 970 Cxi (ink jet) and
the HP LaserJet 5P (laser). They mainly printed &quot;garbage&quot; but it was
striking that there were many graphical symbols.
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe another program that the archive contains can help because
it's meant to be used for adapting printer files. That's probably the
reason for it being called &quot;Printer Driver Modifier (PDM)&quot; and it opens a
window on the Workbench - also in OS 1.3 look. You can adapt any printer
driver you want. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test this because I don't
know the printer commands. Anyway, the program was able to load OS 3.5
printer drivers flawlessly!
</P>
<P>
Additionally, there are some small extra programs in the archive that can
be used for analyzing ASCII texts (which characters have to be sent to the
printer?), for printing texts mirrored/reversed, for sending files directly
to the printer (without using the printer driver) and there's a tiny Assign
program, too.
</P>
<P>
Well, that's Personal Fonts Maker so far. And now let's have a look at the
successor ColorType that's available on Aminet in version 3.1 without any
restrictions, too.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/ColorType.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/ColorType.jpg" WIDTH="86" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
On first view you recognize the similarities to PFM and probably even more
similarities to Personal Paint! And indeed, usage of and many shortcuts are
identical. PPaint users will feel as if they were at home.
</P>
<P>
In ColorType lots of things have been improved compared to PFM - not only
the optics but also usage. You can now select a suitable screen, a clearly
arranged preview has been added and there are all the drawing features that
you may know from PPaint. You can choose more than one brush and - what's
most important: ColorType in contrast to PFM can handle color fonts.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Colortype is not perfect - especially concerning its undo. It
can only turn back the last action. Some other things have been removed
such as the menu &quot;define font&quot; of PFM. With this one the character
positions and the character could be redefined.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the macros have been replaced by an ARexx interface. But, of
course, the macro recorder also disappeared. You'll have to be able to
write your own scripts now to enjoy macros. Luckily there already are some
ARexx scripts and a major part of the documentation (in English) describes
the ARexx commands. The other part mainly consists of two tutorials
(&quot;Colofont in 10 minutes&quot; and &quot;Antialiased font&quot;). Compared to the manual
of PFM this one is rather weak. It's in Amiga Guide format but there are no
links. Maybe that's the reason for the reference to the PFM documentation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, I have to say that anyone who deals with fonts should at least
have a look at ColorType - especially if you know or use PPaint because the
usage is very similar. Even exchanging brushes between PPaint, ColorType
and PFM is no problem.
</P>
<P>
ColorType is much better than PFM but you'll really miss the macro recorder
that you could use for making changes to all charecters easily and quickly.
Additionally, in ColorType there's no support for sending your own fonts to
a printer and even the documentation refers to PFM. So if you often work
with fonts you shoul get these programs from Aminet for free.
</P>
<P>
One last tip for those who need some good color fonts: you can get
Cloanto's Kara Collection from Aminet. They're also freely available now
and there are several great hand-drawn fonts, especially the animated ones.
