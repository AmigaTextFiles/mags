<H2>1. Little helpers for the daily Amiga life (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
In this section of AmigaAktuell I would like to introduce small tools and utilities which make everyday work with the Amiga easier and more comfortable. Most Amiga publications concentrate on the big software packages, so you don't hear much or nothing at all about the small ones.
</P>
<P>
Oh boy, what hasn't happened to me during the last month. A hard disk crash, the loss of my first wisdom tooth (I'm writing this text with a swollen cheek), everything in the middle of approx. 50 moving boxes and now even bug reports about the last issue of Little helpers! So now a small correction for the report about Charon in the August issue of AMIGA aktuell:
</P>
<P>
For the download manager Charon, you can use all catalog files available >from Aminet. It doesn't matter which version of the catalog is used with which version of Charon. For example: You can use catalogs for CharonV1.2 also with CharonV1.3 or 1.4. Not that obvious, was it? And a second thing: The author's (Andrija Antonijevic) nationality is not Polish. Sorry for the misunderstanding!
</P>
<P>
And, as I wrote above, I had a disk crash last month and (of course) no recent backup (ain't that the way it always is!!). This means that I lost emails from some people who made suggestions for this section. Please write me again, especially the person who mentioned ARexx-scripts for using an Internet service to get slow downloads per email. I wanted to write about it in the last issue, but lacked the time for it back then. It sounded very interesting (...and now the email is gone...). I may take a little longer to answer because I'm moving in two days and my new apartment doesn't have a phone line  yet - call that a life, no Internet, no phone! :(
</P>
<P>
For this issue I took a look at the two system classes GradientSlider and ColorWheel, the module player DeliTrackerII V2.32, the Quicktime player Qt2.0 and the pictogram utility Image2Icon. If I should make some mistakes in this issue, I'm going to blame the analgesics I took ;) and ask for your understanding. And now have fun!
</P>
<P><B>GradientSlider/ColorWheel</B></P>
<P>
Some of you might already know that Georg Steger is working on the operating system AROS, which is trying to implement an operating system on Wintel PCs that is comparable and source-compatible to the AmigaOS.  But Georg Steger isn't just planning a simple port of the AmigaOS, he also wants to implement improvements (which he hopes will be downward compatible). Two of these improvements were recently ported back to the original OS by Stephan Rupprecht. We are talking about the system classes ColorWheel and GradientSlider.
</P>
<P>
Installation does not require the Installer from Amiga and is very simple. Just get the two archives from Aminet (or from the sources below), unpack them and copy the two binaries gradientslider.gadget and colorwheel.gadget into the classes/gadgets directory of your boot partition (usually the Workbench partition). That is it. There is nothing to configure.
</P>
<P>
Programs like &quot;IconEdit&quot; or the fractal renderer ChaosPro now use these classes just like the original classes that came with the AmigaOS. But Hi- and True-Color screens now get a colorful palette. And these classes are also recommended for AGA/ECS users (just take a look at the screenshot and you will see what I mean...)
</P>
<P>
The screenshot was made on a AGA screen with 256 colors. Below is the original for comparison.

Displaying the colorwheel takes a little longer, but the result is worth the small performance loss.

<P><B>DeliTrackerII V2.32</B></P>
<P>
Well, I don't really think that I have to introduce DeliTrackerII anymore, it's even found on every Aminet-CD. But, what the hell? DeliTrackerII is THE music player for the Amiga. No matter if you use Sound/Fast/Scream/ProTracker modules or more exotic formats like NSF, PumaTracker or XTracker, DeliTracker plays just all those without problems. Even if you come across a module that spits the dummy, you can find additional decoders on aminet that can be added easily to DeliTracker. The user interface looks rather old-fashioned (Hello, AmigaOS2.0! ;) ), but don't judge DeliTracker's capabilities by its looks.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/DT2GUI.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DT2GUI.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="89" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Currently I can't think of anything useful for a module player that DeliTracker doesn't feature.
</P>
<P>
Be it ARexx- or XPK-support, fast high quality players and easy handling - DeliTracker has everything.
DeliTracker is very modular - for each module format, you need a suitable decoder-module (a so-called player). The Aminet distribution contains about 100 different players.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/DT2Player.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DT2Player.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="33" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
There is also a player for DataTypes, so sound files like AIFF, WAVE or even MP3 are no problem.
Sound output is also handled by modules (called Genies), but these Genies can do more than just play sound. You can also convert files to other formats, open spectrometers or display information about the files you are playing.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/DT2Genies.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/DT2Genies.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="33" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Es gibt sogar ein HappyNewYear-Genie und ein Weihnachts-Genie, das
Glueckwuensche fuer den Jahreswechsel bzw. Weihnachten ausgibt (und sonst nix
weiter ;) ).
</P>
<P>
There is even a HappyNewYearGenie and a Christmas-Genie, which display good wishes for Christmas or the New Year (and nothing else ;) ).
The Player for DigiBoosterPro from Aminet opens up the possibility of writing your own Audio-CDs (for your private use only!), because it supports the sound system AHI. This way, you can easily convert DB-Pro modules to AIFF or WAVE and burn them onto CD with MakeCD or BurnIt.
</P>
<P>
The bad news: development for the Amiga stopped after this version. The good news: DeliTrackerII is now freeware. You don't have to pay for a licence anymore.
But since DeliTracker is very modular, skilled programmers shouldn't stop writing new Players and Genies. This could circumvent the lack of development for the most part.
If you have a Windows computer, you can get the shareware version for Wintel computer (and of course register it, if you like it).
</P>
<P>
System requirements cannot be easily defined, because some Players or Genies use more or less RAM or CPU power. For simple Protracker or MED modules, a &quot;stock&quot; A600 should suffice. For DigiBoosterPro or any other modules with more than 4 channels, the requirements are a little higher. The absolute minimum would be an Amiga with 150KB of free RAM and at least OS2.0.

<P><B>Qt 2.0</B></P>
<P>
Qt 2.0 is a player for Quicktime animations. And, as the name suggests, it is the second version ;). There is no user interface - the arguments are given via shell or ToolTypes. The distribution contains several versions for 68020 to 68040/FPU. These are optimized &quot;by hand&quot; but only compiled with an appropriate compiler flag.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/QT2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/QT2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="48" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
There is no special version for 68060 CPUs. Users of this processor should use the &quot;normal&quot; version. A PPC board is (once again?!) not supported.
</P>
<P>
Quicktime animations can be played directly from hard disk or CD-ROM. To get reasonably fluid animations, your drive should be able to deliver at least 2 to 3 MB of data per second. A 32x SCSI CD-ROM drive (or a fast drive with DMA capability) should do the trick. For smaller animations, a 12x SCSI drive should suffice. Compressed QT animations can also be read from a slower drive, but in this case the processor's name should contain at least two sixes (68060!). When enough RAM is available, you can also load the whole animation into memory. A graphics board would be helpful, too.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other players for the Amiga, Qt2.0 is also able to save the video or audio stream as ILBM files and 8SVX sound. These files can be easily converted by other programs (Wildfire, ADPRo, CDGXL). Qt also has the usual features like Floyd-Steinberg/Ordered/Gray dithering, CyberGFX, HAM and public screens as well as sound output via AHI. For CD32 users, the WriteChunkyPixel mode (WCP) might be interesting, because this makes (as far as I know) an accelerated output possible by using the Akiko chip (but I'm not entirely sure!!).
</P>
<P>
Qt 2.0 supports these quicktime formats:
</P>
Video-Codecs:<BR>
-RLE<BR>
-CinePak<BR>
-Road Pizza<BR>
-JPEG<BR>
-SMC<BR>
-RAW<BR>
Audio-Codecs:<BR>
-MACE<BR>
-IMA4<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Intel Indeo&quot; format is not supported due to high licence fees. The Qt archive also contains the program &quot;Flatten&quot;.
I will have to digress a little to explain why you need this program. Quicktime was invented by Apple. As you know, Apple produces the Macintosh computer, which runs MacOS. The filesystem of MacOS is called HFS (HFS+ for MacOS8 and higher; HFS stands for &quot;hierarchical filesystem&quot;, okay, I'm digressing a lot already ;) ).
In the HFS filesystem, files are split in two parts. The first part is the so-called &quot;resource fork&quot;. You could compare it to the &quot;.info&quot; file on the Amiga, but it contains more information. The second part is the &quot;data fork&quot;. This part contains the data itself. And since Quicktime has been around for a while on Macintoshes, there are a lot of animations on Macintosh CDs (or other HFS formatted media). So if you are reading Macintosh CDs on an Amiga (CacheCDFS from AmigaOS3.5 is good for that purpose), the files are displayed like this:
</P>
datei1.rsrc<BR>
datei1<BR>
datei2.rsrc<BR>
datei2<BR>
...<BR>
etc.<BR>
<P>
The actual output may differ, depending on your CD filesystem. Qt 2.0 can't handle those split files, and that's where &quot;Flatten&quot; comes in. After you've started Flatten, you can drag the data fork onto an AppIcon. Flatten asks for the target file and then combines the resources fork with the data fork so that Qt is able to show the animation.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Flatten.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Flatten.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="87" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
I hope this digression has made Flatten more understandable ;).
</P>
<P>
Now a few tips for Amiga users without a graphics board:
</P>
<P>
1) Get the patches FBlitV3.56 (<A HREF="http://www.tpec.u-net.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.tpec.u-net.com</A>) and
BlazeWCP (Aminet: <A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/util/boot/BlazeWCP.lha">util/boot/BlazeWCP.lha</A>)
and install them as described in their manuals.
</P>
<P>
2) Play the Quicktime animations in Grayscale mode to make the playback less jerky.
</P>
<P>
3) If you have installed BlazeWCP, you should start Qt 2.0 with the &quot;WCP&quot; option. This makes it use the faster chunky2planar routine from BlazeWCP. Play around with the settings a little.
</P>
<P>
4) With the parameter &quot;EVERY&quot;, you can define &quot;Frame-Skips&quot;.
For example, &quot;EVERY=2&quot; displays only every second picture of the animation. This may help if the sound is played faster than the pictures.
</P>

<P><B>Image2Icon:</B></P>
<P>
And last but not least, Image2Icon. I have no idea how to describe this program - the name says most of it. Image2Icon (short &quot;I2I&quot;) takes a picture file and creates an icon with a smaller version of the contents. Or shorter: I2I creates a thumbnail icon from a picture file.
I2I isn't the first program to do this, as some of you surely know, but I think it creates the best visual quality with AmigaOS3.5. I2I offers very fast and good dithering algorithms and takes the aspect-ratio of the file and Workbench into account - the thumbnail of a PAL:HighRes (640x256) picture doesn't look too distorted on a Workbench with 800x600 pixels. Even on a screen with only 16 or 32 colours you can make out what the picture shows thanks to the great dithering.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/I2IPreview32.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/I2IPreview32.jpg" WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
On OS3.0 and OS3.1 systems, the pictures are saved in NewIcon format, under OS3.5 the Color-Icon format is used. You can use any picture formats you have a DataType for. If you want more information, you can have I2I write the dimensions inside the icon, too. You can even define the position and the font to be used.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/I2IInfo.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/I2IInfo.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="34" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If you start I2I from Workbench, it creates an AppIcon you can drop pictures on. Alternatively, I2I is useable from a shell window. You will need at least OS3.0. The manual states that HAM graphics are not supported, but oddly it worked for me without any problems.
