<H2>2. Software test: Vector graphic converter &raquo;MetaView&laquo; (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P><B>Walking between the worlds</B></P>
<P>
MetaView 2.9 - a vector graphic converter
</P>
<H3>1. Why MetaView? Isn't MultiView enough?</H3>
<P>
Without exaggerating, you could easily say that on most Amiga hard disks there is a reasonably large collection of diverse picture data. Be it the pearls of the Pixel-Demo-Scene, clipart collections from Aminet , scanned portraits of dear relatives or raytraced pictures with a more or less artistic approach.
</P>
<P>
As long as we are talking about pixel graphics, it is no big problem to view or edit them, thanks to DataTypes.
</P>
<P>
And one is easily tempted to add some cheap clipart CD from the next discounter. But as soon as you open the first few files, the supposed bargain could reveal itself as a flop (with no regard to the quality of the contents), as these files might have uncommon suffixes like .wmf, .fig, .wpg or .cmx. But before you abuse the CD as a discus and throw it away, wait a minute! Because these foreign fiel formats are not only quite interesting, but can also be put to a use with the Amiga (in most cases). These suffixes hint at vector graphics, which have the interesting feature of being scalable without quality loss - in contrast to pixel graphics. Amiga programs, too, use vector formats internally, like PageStream with DR2D files or DrawStudio with DSDR.
</P>
<P>
And this is the shareware program MetaView comes in. Henk Jonas [1] describes his converter as simply the best there is for the Amiga. And when you look at the supported formats (as of version 2.9 form June 2000), he might be right. Regarding to the manual, MetaView can read and display these formats:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> WMF-Files (also embedded into Windows(tm) CLP-files)</LI>
  <LI> AMF-Files</LI>
  <LI> DXF-Files</LI>
  <LI> DR2D-Files</LI>
  <LI> XFIG-Files (Version 3.0 or 3.1)</LI>
  <LI> WPG-Files (Version 1.0 and 2.0)</LI>
  <LI> GEM-Files</LI>
  <LI> DSDR-Files</LI>
  <LI> CGM-Files</LI>
  <LI> HPGL-Files</LI>
  <LI> CMX-Files</LI>
  <LI> EPS/AI-Files (in conjunction with Ghostscript and PsToEdit)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
If a CMX-file should contain a preview picture, it is saved to T:preview.bmp, where you can display it with Multiview and a suitable DataType.
</P>
<P>
These files can now be saved as
<UL>
<LI> ILBM</LI>
<LI> AMF</LI>
<LI> CGM</LI>
<LI> GEM</LI>
<LI> DR2D</LI>
<LI> HPGL</LI>
<LI> EPS (with TIFF-Preview)</LI>
<LI> AI</LI>
<LI> JMF</LI>
<LI> WMF</LI>
<LI> FIG</LI>
<LI> BMP and TIFF</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
You can find further information about all these formats in the manual, since this would be to much to cover in the test report.
</P>
<H3>2. System requirements</H3>
<P>
MetaView is quite modest when is comes to hard- and software requirements. It needs an Amiga with AmigaOs 3.x, but should also work with AmigaOS2.1, regarding to the author. Furthermore ist requires 1 MB of RAM and more than half a MB of Chip-RAM. For Kickstart 3.x, the 'tabs.gadget' must be installed and for Kickstart 3.1 the updated 'setpatch'. Both are included in the MetaView package. MetaView was tested on an A3000 with AmigaOS3.5, a 68040-CPU, CyberGFX 3.x and 36MB RAM. Another test environment was UAE with AmigaOs 3.1.
</P>
<H3>3. Installation</H3>
<P>
After downloading and unpacking the archive, for example from Aminet, you find an Installation icon in the somewhat untidy Metaview drawer. A double-click, and the installation should be easy as pie.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewDir.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewDir.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="78" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
As long as you use the &quot;Novice&quot; mode, this is true, at least until you reach the first requester of the installation program. If you are selecting a higher level like &quot;Intermediate&quot; or &quot;Expert&quot;, you will be surprised a little sooner. Because all texts are displayed in Polish (?), no matter which language you chose. This can be quite confusing.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewInst.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewInst.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="70" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If you don't understand this language and think you are unable to understand the requesters form the context, you can also install MetaView manually. So move
'libs/amigametaformat.library' to 'libs:', create the directory 'libs:AMF/', copy all files from 'libs/AMF/' to 'libs:AMF/', then move 'libs/gadgets/tabs.gadget' to 'sys:classes/gadgets/' and  the program file &quot;MetaView&quot; to a directory of your choice. The path to MetaView must be set in 'envarc:MetaView.path', e.g. by typing 'echo &quot;(MetaView-Pfad)/MetaView&quot; >envarc:MetaView.path' into a shell. If need be, Metaview, also copies Import-scripts for PageStream3.x, FinalWriter, Wordworth and DrawStudio in the appropriate ARexx-/Macro-directories.
</P>
<H3>4. Usage</H3>
<H4>4.1 File import</H4>
<P>
Immediately after an successful installation, you can feed MetaView with vector graphics, as long as they are no EPSF-files. For these formats, MetaView requires the help of external programs, namely the Ghostscript [3] and PSTOEDIT [4] packages. When they are installed, you need to configure the correct paths in MetaView. Open the menu entry &quot;Settings/Change...&quot; and in the newly opened preferences windows select the page &quot;PS-Import&quot;.
</P>

</P>
<P>
After starting, MeatView creates an AppIcon on the Workbench, where you can drop files to be loaded. Henk Jonas included a few examples for a first test in DR2D, AMF and FIG format. But things start to get really interesting with files from &quot;foreign&quot; sources. Since during time, a lot of files in a large variety of formats have accumalated on hard disks/CDs around my A3000, I could pick form a large selection. Metaview successfully loaded CGM, AMF, DR2D and EPSF files and displayed them without errors. At first, MetaView refused to load HPGL or PLT files with &quot;Open....&quot;. But if you explicitly tell it to load these formats with &quot;Open AS...&quot; it has no problems to display them.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Many Clipart-CDs contain files in WMF format. The AmigaOS can't handle these, but here MetaView is in its element. I haven't found one single file Metaview couldn't load, even though I tried more than 100. :) For some files, MetaView confronts you with a question about font replacement,
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewWMF01.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewWMF01.jpg" WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
but shortly after answering, you will see the file in all its glory.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewWMF02.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewWMF02.jpg" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
When importing DXF files, it sometimes happened that texts or objects were misplaced or that some parts were not drawn at all, while other files displayed without problems.
</P>
<P>
More problems were caused by files in FIG or CMX format. While all files from the AmiFIG demo archive were shown without problems, none of the files included with XFIG 3.2 could be displayed correctly.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewFIG.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewFIG.jpg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
After importing CMX files (which can be found as cliparts bundled with most recent program from Corel), it seems to be a matter of pure luck whether the files are shown correctly or just blank white. This import filter still requires some finetuning until it will be in a useable state.
</P>
<H4>4.2 Picture index</H4>
<P>
An interesting feature can be found under &quot;Others/Picture-Index/New&quot;. Here you can create a catalog index for the files you select.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewIndex.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewIndex.jpg" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
With the right mouse buttons, you can get more information on each file, display, save, print or remove it from the index. the creation of indexes and manipulation of indexed files works good. Only HPGL files aren't handled correctly, since to &quot;unversal-loader&quot; doesn't recognize them, as I described above.
</P>
<P>
The saving of an index is not possible in the shareware version and cost 10 bucks extra in the registered version.  :-(
</P>
<H4>4.3 File export</H4>
<P>
For a converter, the save functions are just as important as loading and displaying. MetaView offers a lot of options. Besides vector formats, you can also save the files in some pixel formats.
</P>
<P>
Almost all save function have been tested successfully, only the writing of TIFF files wasn't possible for all graphics.
</P>
<H4>4.4 Printing</H4>
<P>
For printing, you have the choice between &quot;normal&quot; printers, postscript-enabled printers and plotters. If you have the PLT-handler [5] installed, plotting works on every Workbench printer.
</P>
<P>
The Postscript output to PRTPS [6] didn't work, the printer only received line feeds. A print job started with copy to PRTPS: did work, so the bug seems to be at MetaView.
</P>
<P>
Unusable, bug-ridden and always leading to a crash is printing to the standard printer using the printer.device. Under AmigaOS 3.1 as well as 3.5 to program always hung when the printer window came up.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MetaViewPrint.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MetaViewPrint.jpg" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<H4>4.5 Documentation</H4>
<P>
The manual is sufficient to get started. It is good structured and well written, even though it doesn't always answer all questions. If you a looking for information about printing or plotting for example, you only find a graphic in these sections of the guide, and that just isn't enough.
</P>
<H3>5. Result</H3>
<P>
MetaView is an interesting program and practically without competiton. But the &quot;best vector converter for Amiga&quot; leaves mixed feelings. Some functions don't work correctly, and printing over printer.device even crashes. Still you can print converted files with other programs, but for a shareware program this is hardly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
In spite of its weak points, the program offers an impressing feature-set. If you want to use vector graphics on your Amiga and have taken the hurdles at installing (wrong language, external programs for PS-Import), you have a very useful program for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Pity that Corel-CMX files are recognized only sporadically. If Henk Jonas would bring this filter in a more useable fashion, the shareware fee of 15 Euros would be easier to pay. But if you don't use mainly CMX or FIG files and do not need to print directly via the printer.device, you will do fine with the current version.
