<H3>3. AMIGA 99: Door Prizes</H3>
<P>

PRESS RELEASE:<BR>
Amiga 99 -Door Prizes!<BR>
January 18, 1999<BR>
Door Prizes! Yes, everyone loves door prizes. Amigan-St. Louis, producers of the<BR>
Gateway Computer Show-Amiga 99 are pleased to announce a major addition to our<BR>
already exceedingly nice selection of door prizes.<BR>
Two 1/2 hour periods of 727 simulator time, in a real airline simulator.<BR>
TWA has graciously rented us two 30 minute periods in their Boeing 727 aircraft<BR>
simulator at St. Louis as door prizes. Winners of either of these door prizes<BR>
will be escorted to the TWA training department at midnight, Saturday evening,<BR>
just after the banquet to experience the trill of a lifetime.<BR>
Imagine being at the controls of a real aircraft simulator. Any of us who have<BR>
enjoyed flying the computer simulators can only imagine the thrill of handling<BR>
this gigantic piece of hardware. Now two lucky winners will actually get behind<BR>
the controls of TWA's 727 airline simulator. The same kind that airlines all<BR>
over the world use to train their pilots. You can appreciate what an exciting<BR>
experience this will be for the winners.<BR>
The lucky individuals will have the opportunity to fly with a real pilot in this<BR>
simulator, and will receive an official flight logbook, in which we will list<BR>
the 30 minutes of time spent flying this marvel of flight training.<BR>
These two prizes make an exciting addition to all the fine prizes that so many<BR>
companies are providing. Check our web page at: http://www.amiga-stl.com under<BR>
Amiga99/prizes to see a more complete list. Check back because the list is<BR>
growing every week. Tickets may be ordered by calling: 1-800-59-AMIGA (26442).<BR>
Don't wait any longer, purchase your tickets to Amiga 99, the Gateway Computer<BR>
Show being held in St. Louis, MO, Friday March 12 - Sunday March 14 at the Henry<BR>
VIII hotel. Winners will be selected from the Saturday prize drawing at the<BR>
close of Saturdays show.<BR>
Winners must be present to win and only this time slot is available for the<BR>
prize. Simulator will be flown in night mode, with motion off.<BR>
The Amiga... It's taking off, and so is Amiga 99!<BR>
