In the mid of January Markus Konjevic of the German company media group,
better known as Eagle Computer mentioned incredible allegations in a
public Amiga forum.
</P>
<P>
During an USA visit Mr. Konjevic wants to have found out, that the
announced Amiga OS 3.5 isn't under development.
</P>
<P>
Well, I just want to mention at this place, that Amiga OS 3.5 isn't
developped by Amiga, Inc., but - according to statements of Petro
Tyschtschenko - mostly by Haage &amp; Partner. It is true, that it looks
like that the upgrade of the Amiga operating system will not have as
many outstanding features as expected in the beginnings, but to claim in
opposition to every official - and maybe more valuable - inofficial
informations, that the upgrade of the Amiga OS isn't developped without
any evidence, is more than risky.
</P>
<P>
But not enough with that: Amiga OS 5.0 isn't to be released - but why then
the cooperation with QNX, Mr. Konjevic? - as well as there were no A4000T
motherboards available in the future, which was hardly demented by Amiga
International. And not just this: According to Petro Tyschtschenko there
will be taken legal actions against Mr. Konjevic. As if there weren't
enough problems for the Amiga...
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is a bit overdone to speculate, why Mr. Konjevic made claims of
this kind, but one thing is to mention: The company he belongs to made
nearly a complete retreat from the Amiga market a long time ago. Currently
they offer the Eagle-Linux-CD, which has a quality that has been characterized
as fair to middling by various Amiga magazines (s. short Test in Amiga aktuell 08/98),
as well as some parts of their former tower conversion product line and
Pentium extension boards. Lean as expected is the homepage of this company
(<A HREF="http://www.eagle-cp.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.eagle-cp.com</A>) vertreten.
regarding the Amiga. If media group/Eagle wants to create the impression, that
it was an involved Amiga company and represents <CITE> the interests of every
Amiga user</CITE> then this doesn't just fight the facts, but derides all the
companies, which really involve for the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
But even with all the differences I have to agree with Mr. Konjevic in
one point: I think, it's an absurdity, if some Amiga magazines give values
of 95 percent or more in product test. Values like these should be reserved
for products, which are excellent in any way. But this happens as good as
never, because there are always things to improve.
</P>
<P>
See you next month,
</P>

yours,
