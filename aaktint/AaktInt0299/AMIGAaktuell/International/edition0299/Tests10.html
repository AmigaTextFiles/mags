<B>Installation:</B>
<P>
The device is easily plugged into the parallel port and the joystick port,
any other devices are connected to the switchbox, that's all.
</P>
<P>
The sofware can be copied anywhere you like. The joystick port is connected
through, so you can use it for other purposes.
</P>
<B>Design:</B>
<P>
Due to the fact that this device is some years old (1991), but is available
as a remainder from Amiga Oberland no judgement of value can be made for the
design. The device itself is a &quot;gigiantic&quot; plastic box with 3
parallel ports and lighted buttons.
</P>
<P>
In addition the parallel input is a flat band cable of approx. 23.4 inch
length as well as the jystick port 2 adaptor, which has to offer a good
5 V power supply. The included software is functional, but no beauty in
design.
</P>
<B>Documentation:</B>
<P>
The documentation is a collection of 10 pages in DIN A5 (approx. 5.8 inch
x 8.3 inch) format, which explains the functions and usage of the device
well.
</P>
<B>Practical test:</B>
<P>
After installing the hard &amp; software the switching has worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
Because TurboPrint supports the Arxon box since revision 3.x the included
software needn't to be used.
</P>
<P>
TurboPrint switches fast and save and addresses the correct device as set
in the settings.
</P>
<P>
Also the usage of Cardattack and a sound sampler didn't result in
problems, the devices have worked fine.
</P>
<B>Positive:</B>
<P>
Makes 3 ports out of one, no more plugging.
</P>
<P>
The support using TurboPrint is done magnificent, the switching is done
silent and without mumbling in the background.
</P>
<P>
The best is, that the interior of the device is that &quot;small&quot; it can be
built into an eventually present tower case.
</P>
<B>Negative:</B>
<P>
Only available as a remainder and quit expensive for that fact. Low quality
finish (external flat band cables).
</P>
<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
A good purchase for anybody, who wants to have some more parallel ports
to address more devices after another. For those who own more than a printer
and own TurboPrint this device is strongly recommended.
