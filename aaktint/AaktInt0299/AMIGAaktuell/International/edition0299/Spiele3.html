<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Welcome to a new edition of the AMIGA aktuell international games section.
This month there are so many news, not only due to the publication of the
source codes of Witches and Heretic. Many new games were announced, but some
of them cancelled. Maybe you remember the preface of the last month... I
attacked the software pirates and mentioned Titan Computer as an example to
make clear how hard the current situation is. Well, it seems, that it has
happened, what many peoply were afraid of: There are rumours which mean that
Titan Computer cancelled some games under development, e.g. Shadow of the 3rd Moon 2
and Total Combustion. This seems to be the worst news of the month. :-((
</P>
<P>
But I noticed, that there are announced new games continously, but as good as none is
released!? There were e.g. more than 20 new games announced for the end of 1998/start
of 1999, but nearly none were released. Just the fact that more than 8000 PowerPC boards
should be reason enough to publish new games. There weren't even demo version except Marblelous 2
which were published. So this edition has no review, but a lean preview of Marblelous 2.
</P>
<P>
Another fact is, that this month is marked by the search for developers. If this are
programmers, graphical designers or musician. Various groups are looking for good developers
to make their projects come true.
</P>
<P>
This month there are charts again, but no reader's charts, but the GTI sales charts. In addition
I have an interview with Digital Images for you. If there aren't any reviews, then there's at least
an interview!
</P>
<P>
So, have fun with the news and send me mail!
