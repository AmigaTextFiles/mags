<H3>1. Preliminary remark</H3>
<P>
The first for you to know: If you're planning to create your own CDs, you
should get informed BEFOR (!!) buying a CD-writer is supported by which
software. If you don't do this a supposed bargain can mutate to a bad buy.
Not every writer is supported by the Amiga software packages or it has
problems and produces &quot;trash&quot; CDs.
</P>
<P>
After long and in the end successful negotiations with a man who is known
nearly world-wide a Ricoh MP6200S CD-RW-writer works in my Amiga since
December 24 of the last year. This writer is a 2x2x6 device, which means
that CD-RW and CD-R can be written with double speed and normal CDs can
be read with sixfold speed.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Amiga has no much use for a writer alone and so there was
a need of the fitting software. I decided for MakeCD by Angela Schmidth and
Patrick Ohly.
</P>
<P>
MakeCD is shareware. The usable demo version has only minor limitations and
can be used for a judgement its power. Compared with the registered version
the unregistered version has these limitations:

<P>
The CD-RW-writer was tested in combination with MakeCD on an A3000 with
built-in SCSI-host adaptor, updateded SCSI chip (WD 08), 12 MB RAM and
a 040/40 processor under CyberGFX v3 and a nearly completely used
SCSI-system (6 connected devices).
</P>
<H3>2. Installation</H3>
<P>
<B>2.1 Hardware</B>
</P>
<P>
The writer can be added easily to the system as any SCSI device does. In addition
to the mechanical mounting you have just to watch out for the fitting ID and
the termination of the SCSI chain. Ready.
</P>
<P>
<B>2.2 Installation software</B>
</P>
<P>
MakeCD can be used without prior installation directly out of the unarchived
lha archive (Aminet) resp. tar.gz package (disk), but a hard disk installation
is useful.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD01.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD01.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="60" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
This can be done easily and comfortable using the help of the installer.
During the installation MakeCD and all its data are copied into its own
directory on a hard drive (partition) of your choice.
</P>
<P>
In addition MakeCD offers some Goodies, which can be usful when using
MakeCD.
</P>
<P>
The correct writer driver can be selected during the installation as well.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD02.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD02.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="68" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes MakeCD found its new home on the hard disk and can be
prepared for its mission.
</P>
<H3>3. Use of the program</H3>
<P>
<B>3.1 Program interface</B>
</P>
<P>
MakeCD uses the triton.library by Stefan Zeiger, so there appears the
(standard) interface. The GUI is functional and clearly arranged even if
a great number of windows and a nearly immense possibilites for the
configuration can puzzle you on the first use.
</P>
<P>
If you are a beginner you should use the setting &quot;Beginner&quot; found
in the window &quot;Global environment&quot; to keep the overview.
</P>
<P>
The activated online-help of the basic configuration is quite helpful,
much like the bubble help in MUI programs.
</P>
<P>
Because MakeCD offers much manipulations for the design of the CD you want
to write, there's just small example of how to burn a data CD.
</P>
<P>
<B>3.2 Writing a CD (example for a data CD)</B>
</P>
<P>
First you have to adapt MakeCD to the available hardware. In addition to
the read and write device(s) there's e.g. the user level, additional buffer
memory and the audio output (only important for the creation/test of material
for audio-CDs).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD03.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD03.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="60" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Even if the manual explicitly informs about possible problems when using
one SCSI-host adaptor for writer and hard disk(s), both could co-exists without
any problems in this case.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely recommended (not only if a problem occurs) to read the
manual intensive. So you could avoid the one or other &quot;trash&quot; CD.
</P>
<P>
After choosing the fitting basic settings you can write your first CD.
</P>
<P>
For this MakeCD has to know, how many tracks should written on the CD
and what for data have really to be in the tracks. A click on &quot;New&quot;
creates the still empty track 1 &quot;Data (Mode 1)&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD04.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD04.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="58" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Now you can inform MakeCD using the track options of which kind the data
source and the data target have to be. You can specify as a source an
image file, which was previously created by MakeCD, a track of a CD you
want to copy, a file system (which means the contents of a hard disk/ drawer)
or a block medium.
</P>
<P>
The desired target is directly the CD, an image file, which is to be created
or a block medium.
</P>
<P>
In this example there are various hard disk partitions selected as sources.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD05.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD05.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="58" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
MakeCD allows the choice of various boot options, so the completed CD is
e.g. bootable on a CDTV or CDTV, if you use the expert mode.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose you need the correct trademark files, which aren't included
with MakeCD, but can be found e.g. on the AMIGA Developer CD v1.1.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD06.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD06.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="57" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Now the tracks can be written.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD07.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD07.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="46" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If you want to make a CD-copy of your hard disk and there are many tiny files
(collections of icons, postings of a newsgroup, etc.) it is recommended to
crete an image file of this hard drive (partition), to avoid a buffer underflow
during the writing.
</P>
<P>
A buffer underflow is a MCA for the writing process. And at least the
current track is usually lost, except you use a CD-RW.
</P>
<P>
To avoid this danger MakeCD offers a test mode, in which the writter not really
writes a CD and you can find out, if a buffer underflow was possible on your
system.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/MakeCD08.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MakeCD08.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="86" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<H3>4. Compatibility/ reliability</H3>
<P>
<B>4.1 CD-RW-writer</B>
</P>
<P>
The Ricoh MP6200S (Firmware v2.20) works fine with MakeCD. Only with CD-RW
it insists on double speed for writing these media.
</P>
<P>
In normal use and good ventilation the Ricoh MP6200S is a good writer.
</P>
<P>
After an uninterrupted use (various CD-RW write and erase cycles without
interruption) the writer seemed to have thermal problems, because a medium
could not be read correctly. But after a small interruption it was
cooperating again.
Audio-CD-R(W) are written without any harmful interference and judged by me
as copies with good quality.
</P>
<P>
<B>4.2 CD-R(W)-media</B>
</P>
<P>
There were used branded as well as noname CD-R and CD-RW. The normal price
for the media was around 3.00 DEM (approx. 1.53 Euro) for a CD-R and
10.00 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euro) for a CD-RW. All media could be written
without errors. The CD-R media could be used with many CD-ROM and
audio CD players.
</P>
<P>
Only an approx. 6 year old audio CD player didn't recognize the audio-CD-R
written by myself.
</P>
<P>
More problematically are the RW-media, because there degree of reflection
is about 15% compared with a pressed CD (CD-R are at approx. 70%). Many
tested CD-ROM and audio-CD players are unable to recognize and to play these
media. If your CD player is built in 1997 or younger you have a good chance
to use the CD-RW media with this drive, too.
</P>
<P>
My audio CD player Sony CDP-XE320 didn't have any problems with these
CD-RW media.
</P>
<P>
But my CD-ROM Panasonic CR-506B was unwilling to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
A CD-RW medium was erased and written for approx. 20 times, without any
failure. But this didn't reach the maximum of 1000 write/ erase cycles,
so I can't make any statement regarding the rewritability.
</P>
<H3>5. Conclusion</H3>
<P>
MakeCD and the Ricoh MP6200S are a good and powerful team. From the beginning
CD-R and CD-RW could be created. But it you want to use all the possibilites
of the program, you need a longer setting-in period.
</P>
<P>
A fine German documentation helps the user a lot. You just have to read it...
<BR>(Remark of the translator: I don't own MakeCD, so I don't know, if there's
an English documentation with the same quality.)
</P>
<P>
MakeCD supports all standard CD formats and is a good choice for the Amiga user.
</P>
<P>
The price of 75 DEM (approx. 38.27 Euro) for the TAO version, resp. 115 DEM
(approx. 58.67 Euro) for the full version is alright, if you consider its
power.
