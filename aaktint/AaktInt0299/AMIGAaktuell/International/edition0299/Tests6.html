<B>Installation:</B>
<P>
The installation is done by the Commodore (Amiga, Inc.) installer. You can
choose between English and French documentation.
</P>
<B>Design:</B>
<P>
AmiCAD runs os-friendly on its own, freely selectable screen. The colours
and font can be freely selected. AmiCAD is a CAD program (Computer Aided
Design), which is specialized on electronic elements using special
libraries. So it is possible to draw circuits quick and clean and to put
them out.
</P>
<B>Practical test:</B>
<P>
After the first start you have to adjust the colors and the font to allow
working with the program. Using AmiCAD it is possible to draw circles,
rectangles and any other basic form, but AmiCAD is predistined and designed
for the use in the electronic area.
</P>
<P>
The included libraries with the electronic elements are unfortunately mostly
French, so there are sometimes problems to figure out the element.
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to place elements and connections easily. Unfortunately
AmiCAD doesn't offer a &quot;current simulation&quot;, which made it possible
to test a built circuit, but who just wants a clear drawing of a circuit can
live with that.
</P>
<P>
The output of the drawing is done per print-out, as file in AmiCADs own
format or as an IFF picture to continue editing in PPaint/DPaint.
</P>
<B>Positive:</B>
<P>
Runs os-friendly. The print-out is of high quality. Quick creation of
electronic drawings due to included libraries is possible.
</P>
<B>Negative:</B>
<P>
Many parts are in French. Saving is only possible in its own format or
as IFF.
</P>
<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
Who already ons the MaxonCAD revision 2.0-2.5 and the libraries that belong
to it has no use for AmiCAD. Else you can create drawings quickl and easy,
which cannot exported into the Windows world, but printed or exported as
a low quality IFF picture to find its way into a paint program. Those who
don't dare of this is good served with AmiCAD.
