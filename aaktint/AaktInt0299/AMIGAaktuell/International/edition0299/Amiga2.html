<H3>2. An open letter to the Amiga community - by Jeff Schindler</H3>
An Open Letter to the Amiga Community - December 1998
Amiga has always had certain strengths that have never been matched by any other
operating system. It's small, efficient, and multimedia-centric. As Allan
Havemose as often said, "We just did it right." Even today the Amiga can
outperform and outrun today's dominant operating system.
There has been a great deal of excitement and concern over the last few weeks
about the future for the Amiga. With the recent announcement in Germany of our
OS partner QNX and the demonstration of what this package can do, we began
speeding forward to the future.
When Amiga Inc. was formed our goal was to determine the best road for Amiga to
take. We wanted to:
 * Continue the current development path and create another version of the
   operating system.
 * Build a new team from scratch and re-write the OS with the new features
   necessary to be competitive.
 * Locate an operating system with the same ideals and spirit that the Amiga
   has.
We joined in a partnership with QNX to create the NG Amiga. But that didn't mean
that we intended to forget about the classic system users and the faithful Amiga
community. We're going to continue working on getting 3.5 out the door, but we
also need to get started working on the new operating system.
We are committed to a long and exciting future for the Amiga, and the community
that has kept this magnificent architecture alive.
Amiga 3.5 is a work in progress; it has NOT been abandoned. We learned over the
last several weeks, that what we believed we were getting from our partners in
the project was not always what they understood they were to deliver. So we are
going back to each and every partner in the 3.5 project to make sure that what
they are working on is what our customers require. It is critical that we
deliver what we promised--a complete package.
Some of you have been concerned about the future of Amiga and our commitment to
our developers and the community. Please know that your questions and e-mails
have not been ignored. We are working very hard to complete the final phases of
3.5 and get the developer programs and final specifications worked out with our
partner QNX. We want to deliver the most robust and exciting operating system
ever. We will do it.
Thanks for your patience and support. The Amiga is on the right path, and we
look forward to delivering both 3.5 and the NG Amiga soon.
Keep the faith. We're close.
