An old pioneer on way back from obscurity<BR><BR>
By Nick Miller<BR><BR><BR>
<BR>
The Commodore Amiga home computer could become the John Travolta of the computer world, thanks to PC selling giant Gateway 2000 Inc.<BR>
	The company has taken the Amiga under its wing, hoping to revive the career of the former household name PC.<BR><BR><BR>
<BR>
Gateway subsidiary Amiga International is marketing the old technology world-wide with renewed vigour, and another Gateway subsidiary, Amiga Inc. is working on a new cutting edge Amiga machine for the home market.<BR>
	After the heady days of the late 80s and early 90s, when Steven Spielberg used the machines to mock up scenes in Jurassic Park, the Amiga has itself become a dinosaur<BR>
	No new Amiga has been developed for almost eight years, and most users have abandoned the platform for PCs and Apple Macs.<BR>
	But a turnaround is on the horizon, according to Amiga International chief Petro Tyschtschenko, who was in Perth last week to talk to the local Amiga users' club.<BR>
	Mr Tyschtschenko was with Commodore when the first Amiga was produced.<BR>
	He stuck with the Amiga through the bankruptcy of Commodore in 1994, then in 1995 the bankruptcy of Escom, which bought the Amiga trademarks and intellectual property.<BR>
	He helped negotiate purchase of the Amiga technology by Gateway in March 1997 in a deal, which included a commitment from Gateway to invest strongly in the Amiga.<BR>
	Since then Amiga International has consistently achieved a small profit for Gateway, selling Amiga chips and machines world-wide.<BR>
	Last year, the company had revenue of $10million, selling mainly in Europe and the US, and finding business in India and Australia.<BR>
	Does the Amiga really have a future? Mr Tyschtschenko said its traditional strengths had been in areas now grouped together and called multimedia.<BR>
	Although the Amiga was a stand-out machine in its day; the PC and Apple Macintosh had caught up.<BR><BR><BR>
<BR>
But the big pool of Amiga users who reluctantly left the machine would come back once the technology was updated, he said.<BR>
	"This time we have lots of competitors, everyone wants to go in the same direction," he said.  "Our system is very good, but a little bit dusty on some things."<BR>
	"It was necessary to make a cut and start on a new generation."<BR>
	Mr Tyschtschenko said it was difficult to sell the current Amiga A1200 machines to resellers.  When they heard that it had only2MB of RAM, no CD-ROM and only a 14MHz processor, they concluded no one would want to buy one.<BR>
	The new generation Amiga machine would use the latest processor, probably a Power PC chip.  It would not be compatible with the old Amiga technology but would use the QNX real time operating system.<BR>
	It would feature fully protected pre-emptive multi-tasking (also promised in the coming Macintosh OS X), true 32-bit performance, high performance OpenGL 3-D graphics and full Java support.<BR>
	The architecture is expected to be finished in March 2000, with a launch after that.<BR>
	Although there would be a workstation version, the machine would be pitched as a so-called "appliance computer" for the home which combined DVD entertainment, Internet and Pay-TV applications.<BR>
	The new Amiga would sell for$US500<BR>
	Mr Tyschtschenko said it might be difficult to attract software developers back to the platform, especially game developers who lost lots of money in the dying years of the old Amiga.<BR>
But if they saw the platform had potential, they would start work on the Amiga again, he said.<BR>
