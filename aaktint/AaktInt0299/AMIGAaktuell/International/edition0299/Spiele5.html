<H2>5. Preview: Marblelous 2</H2>
<P>
This month a demo version of Marblelous 2, which was published on the Computer '98,
was released. The game was developped by the APC&amp;TCP and Frank Otto, who
also developped Parrot island. The demo versions are available in two versions:
one standard version and one RTG version for graphics boards. In the full version
there is also an AGA version. In addition there is a leveleditor shipped with the game.
Due to the well-known idea of the game the fun with the game is guaranteed.
But you notice, that the graphics are a bit 'old-fashioned', as you know it from
the games from the older ages. It seems, that no graphic contains more than 32 colours
except the title screen. So the demo version leaves a middle-class impression:
You have fun with the game, but the graphics isn't completely convincing. Maybe this
changes with the full version, but I can't judge this before I get the full version. So
there maybe an extended test in the next edition.
