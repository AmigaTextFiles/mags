<B>Installation:</B>
<P>
The device is easily connected with two 25 pin cables to each computer.
The printer is being connected to the output of the switch. That's it the
device doesn't need any external power supply.
</P>
<B>Design:</B>
<P>
The case has a quite &quot;cheap&quot; look and is much too big for the used
technic inside. The device itself has a small, blue button, which is for
manual input selection and is unlikely to be used.
</P>
<B>Documentation:</B>
<P>
The documentation is just a 4.3 inch x 5.85 inch piece of paper, which
lists the features of the device.
</P>
<P>
According to the documentation the device is supposed to have DIP switches,
but I didn't find them. Using them should set the &quot;Time Out&quot; (maybe
this is true for another model of the printer switch).
</P>
<B>Practical test:</B>
<P>
After connecting the switch to the printer (first the BJC 610, then for
another test the HP LaserJet 4L) with both computers some test printouts
were made, which the switch managed automatically and switched as expected.
The printout is as fast as usually, but it is no longer necessary to
switch the two computers to the printer manually.
</P>
<P>
There weren't any problems with printer spoolers.
 (e.g. Printman by Stephan Rupprecht &lt;<A HREF="mailto:stephan.rupprecht@primus-online.de">stephan.rupprecht@primus-online.de</A>&gt;)
</P>
<B>Positive:</B>
<P>
It ran at once and didn't have any problems, I was afraid of before the
test. Due to the fact that a new printer usually needs a bi-directional
switch these days (which are quite more expensive, e.g. Highscreen fourfold
Auto Data Switch (test of this device follows)), I expected the switch not
to work, what might be true for Windows only due to the printer drivers,
because there are printers, which want a permanent connection to the computer
(e.g. HP 600 series). (Can be switched off locally with the driver.) If there
are problems there is the blue button at the switch to get a direct connection.
</P>
<B>Negative:</B>
<P>
The cheap finish of the case and the &quot;very short&quot; documentation are
no recommendation for the switch. In addition the help of the local seller
doesn't make you buy it spontanously, if you ask for informations and co-operation
with bi-directioanl printers. (Quotation: &quot;I'm sorry, I can't help you, you
have to try it at home&quot;).
</P>
<B>Conclusion:</B>
<P>
A good investment for all of you who have more than 1 computer and don't want
to manually plug or switch their printer.
