<H3>1. Mega software test: Wildfire\7 (by Richard Diezmann)</H3>
<P>
»Wildfire\7-Betatest 1.1
</P><P>
Our software test is divided in 3 parts. Part I describes the
configuration on an Amiga 4000 with 68060.
Part II tells about the impressions we got with Wildfire\7 on a
PPC board by phase 5. In Part III we test the DraCo platform, at last.
We show the possibilities to connect Wildfire in an elegant way with
Movieshop which makes it possible to use the fantastic effects of
the compositor in a running video...
</P><P>
</P><P>
			     P a r t   I
</P><P>
Configuration: Amiga 4000 with Cyberstorm 060 Mk-I processor board,
72 MB main memory and CyberVision64 4 MB- graphics board. Picture output
as YAFA-animation resp. single picture export in JPEG resp. IFF 24 bit.
</P><P>
</P><P>
Preface
</P><P>
In the following test of the brand-new version of Wildfire\7 we will
test how good the usage and handling of the animation sequencer and
the compositor are and which results you might expect on the different
platforms.
</P><P>
Wildfire\7 is one of the few big program packages, which was developed
for the Amiga, recently. Due to the bad taste of bankrupcy which is still
with this platform, this circumstance has to be mentioned. Even, if there's
the hope that the Amiga and its brilliant operating system contine since
the Amiga show in Cologne in November 98, new developments especially in
hardware, but also in software, become more and more seldom.
</P><P>
A program like Wildfire\7 has to do something special, to give the remaining
Amiga users a reason not to go to the Windows world. And Wildfire\7 offers
specials of a kind, which did not exist in the rest of the computer world.
Not to mention with this price-performance ratio. But one after the other.
</P><P>
</P><P>
What is Wildfire\7?
</P><P>
First shareware for a very mathematical picture manipulation it developped
within 3 years to a program package, which can't put into a category easily.
On one hand it is a picture editing program, which puts clever effects on
single pictures, which are much more than shearing or fading. You can also
experiment with 3D as witch fonts and shadows, lights and reflections and
then animate the result. This can be done with manipulating a picture about
the time and so animates it or you take a sequence, an animation from a
digital editing program (VLab-Motion/DraCo!) and then starts Wildfire\7.
The results are converted into a seperate animation, a MPEG video or again
as a series of single pictures for further editing. It is also possible to
use existing Quicktime and AVI sequences for manipulation with Wildfire.
</P><P>
</P><P>
System requirements
</P><P>
Of course, the system requirements aren't the same as the ones you needed
for Amiga programs some years ago. Professional results need professional
hardware. So don't get confused, if you want to really use Wildfire you need a
powerful Amiga. Especially, if you want to use the complete range of 3D
effects. So you need at least a processor like Motorolas last one, the 68060.
It would be better to own a PPC, which is supported by Wildfire\7 as one of
the first large applications. Much RAM should also be available. 32 MB,
better 64 MB and more. Because Wildfire\7 always computes with a color depth
of 24 bit, a graphics board is useful. Current boards, especially the
CyberVision, are supported directly. But even older boards like the wide
spreaded MacroSystem board Retina Z3 can be used. Amigas with AGA graphics
and 68030/40 processor are just enough for a small test. There is no fun
with this type of hardware. You might have noticed at various other programs
and you should act. The remaining hardware industry for the Amiga would
be happy...
</P><P>
The complete range of Wildfire\7's power can be experienced, if you
use the only clone for digital video editing based on AmigaOS, the DraCo.
Because this computer is able to playback the renderformats of any size
created by Wildfire\7 in an adequate way. A playback rate of 25 frames
per second and a resolution of 768x576 pixels in 24 bit is no problem
with a DraCo! An so you enter graphical worlds, which were restricted
to the effect studios of the movie and television industry...
</P><P>
</P><P>
Installation
</P><P>
The new revision of Wildfire\7 is delivered on a CD. There you will find
the program, example files and an online tutorial in HTML format. Included
is there well-known browser IBrowse as a 30-minutes runtime special version
(with some restrictions). But this is enough for reading the online manual.
Important is to mention MUI, which has to be available in revision 3.8.
A demo of MUI is also included, so you are able to install Wildfire. The
MUI demo version cannot save the configuration, so you should think about
registering for the shareware.
</P><P>
The actual installation is done as usual on the Amiga with the installer,
which is available in English and German and copies the necessary program
parts (a bit more than 20 MB) to the hard disk. This is done in a few
minutes. After that an entry of Wildfire\7 is added to the User-Startup file
and you can start the program.
steht nichts mehr im Wege.
</P><P>
But the installer doesn't copy either IBrowse nor MUI on the hard disk.
This has to be done manually with the &quot;Bonus directory&quot;, if
both programs weren't used before. Also on the CD you will find the
current 68060 and PPC libs (phase5), which have to be exchanged manually,
if there is a need for them. Wildfire\7 recognizes the processor type
during the installation and copies the desired program parts to the
hard disk.
</P><P>
Careful persons save the old libs, e.g. of the CyberStorm turbo board and
exchange them for the new ones of the CD. With my A4000 computer I got a
faulty start of the CyberVision drivers. Maybe that they also had to be
adjusted. But Wildfire doesn't include any updates. Using the old
060 libs it worked, so the new ones aren't currently necessary. Which
consequences this could have during the Wildfire run is not mentioned
in the online manual.
</P><P>
The installation itself was without any problems. After that Wildfire can
be started and after a little while the start window of the program
appears as typical for MUI applications on the Workbench. If the Workbench
isn't in a 24 bit mode Wildfire runs in mode, which isn't ideal according
to the manual. Due to the internal 24 bit calculations all preview pictures
have to be re-computed. So it is recommended to run Wildfire on a 24 bit
screen. But that is not so easy on an Amiga. Some elder graphics boards
as my CyberVision64 resp. Retina Z3 don't offer ergonomic resolutions in
24 bit due to graphic chip and graphic memory. This means if you don't want
to forego for a high resolution screen the screen flickers with 50 to 60
Hz. This is no longer modern. Because Wildfire creates asynchronous windows,
there could be open a lot of them, so an 800x600 screen is not good enough.
The compromise is at 1024x768. A higher resolution would be better. A 16 bit
mode can be recommended, too, because the re-computing is quite fast. Still
the Amiga users dream of the 8 MB/120 Hz bards for little money as on the
PC...
</P><P>
</P><P>
Program start and first impressions
</P><P>
The program start needs its time. You get the suggestion, that there
&quot;brought the big guns&quot;. The welcome window in full colour, which is
not just modern since Photoshop on the PC and Monument Designer on the Amiga
appears shortly to disappear at once, so you cannot read anything. But that
can be done using &quot;Project/about Wildfire&quot;. The click-off button
with the shape of a red &quot;Windows-X&quot; isn't necessary. Should this
be an omen for an Intel conversion?!
</P><P>
</P><P>
 Bubble help
</P><P>
MUIs usual bubble help is extended and quite useable for the beginning.
You can switch off the upcoming bubbles later. But now, they are welcome,
because you can get puzzled easily when &quot;entering&quot; the software
first. It begins completely harmless. With a index card, divided in
3 parts. This is the main menu of Wildfire\7, which was improved versus
its pre-successor in its arrangement. This is at least the announcement.
</P><P>
 Pulldown menu &quot;Projekt&quot;
</P><P>
The pulldown menus aren't many at this place. Just three of them are
present. Using the &quot;Project&quot; you can load an already present
project or save it. Or begin an entirely new one. MUIs ability to
display HTML is set to work. But the GIF animations are lost. These are
present with IBrowse (see top!) only! And just them suggest the beginner
what he can expect from Wildfire: finest graphic effects...
</P><P>
Important in the first pull down menu are the general settings of Wildfire.
The beginner must not mix them up with the ones of the just mentioned
index card. Here you will find a top &quot;Settings&quot; on the third
index card, too. But this is for the settings of the current project,
while the settings in the first menu are the general settings of
Wildfire, which are more than the project settings. These are e.g. the
used font, the screen mode of the internal animation type YAFA, what
pririty the program should have, where to save the setup, which is the
path to the external players resp. editors, where to put the animation
single pictures, etc. The definition of the function keys, which can
execute macros, is set here, too.
</P><P>
Unfortunately the config file of wildfire doesn't remember, which was
the output screen of Wildfire, you previously entered in the MUI setup.
After a restart the Workbench screen is being set. So you have to repeat
the settings in the compositor each time, which are valid up to the
moment you exit Wildfire\7. This should be corrected in an update.
</P><P>
Below the Wildfire settings you find the ones of MUI. Here you can
setup the public screen, Wildfire shall run on, if you use the MUI
setup topic &quot;System&quot;. This can be e.g. the Workbench itself
or an own screen and in which colour depth.
</P><P>
</P><P>
 Pulldown menu &quot;Window&quot;
</P><P>
The pulldown menu &quot;Window&quot; consists of 5 entries. The first one
is the so-called  &quot;logbook&quot;. Here you can view a type of protocol
file, which informs about the program run. It is also important with
errors and their analysis. A very elegant solution is, that you can add
own comments using the help of an editor, which was set into the path
settings (see above!). the second entry shows the clipboard, which is
similar to the one of Windows. Here you can store certain compositing data,
so they are available quick. This accelerates the computing proccesses.
Created &quot;Sessions&quot;, as the scripts of Wildfire\7 are named,
remember these clipboard data and with exchanging the actual picture data
and changing the render parameters of the effects you quickly get new
variations and creations.
</P><P>
The third entry makes tension: &quot;Anim displayer&quot; shows YAFA
and IFF animations, Wildfire created. There are many examples on the
CD, so you get a suggestion, which can be done. In the settings window
&quot;Player&quot; you set some basic things: The path to the animations,
which are on the CD. With &quot;Display&quot; you set, which size and
quality the animation shall have. This even can be optimized for an
output on a video beamer! The actual playback of the animation can be
set with &quot;Output&quot;. Here you can choose between the output via
&quot;Hardware&quot;, which is a 15 kHz AGA-output on the desired monitor
and at once can be edited e.g. via genlock. The fastest display is with
256 colours.  The output in a window in wildfire is also possible. This
depends on the colour depth (see preface!), but according to tests 16 bit
is enough. At least small dimensioned animations of low pixel resolution
are fast enough.
</P><P>
An additional window output with &quot;HG-Window&quot; is selectable, too.
The use of this output cannot be realized, because there was no difference
in the output, at least at this test, even if BubbleHelp means there was
another &quot;click away resp. select click&quot; available... However,
the screen refresh redraws the background of the animation window, if this
is moved. Why an own menu point for that?!
</P><P>
At last there is the output on any screen, so you can select an Amiga
screen mode like &quot;Super72&quot;! The output isn't scaled like with
the PAL output (no zooming!), so it appears sharper, but a bit slower.
</P><P>
In addition you can play the animation on a freely selectable screen of
the graphics board, so the Wildfire desktop is faded out. This setting is
done with the setting field &quot;screen mode&quot;. Together with the
setting field for the colour depth you can optimize the playback &quot;
for the speed&quot;. Because all the animations are rendered with a maximum
of 256 colours you cannot notice any difference. To make them run on any
hardware this is expected to be necessary. But what puzzles me: a display
in grey was selectable, but not possible!
</P><P>
Because any single picture output is possible for the colour depth as well
as for the resolution of the pictures, absolutely professional results can
be made, if the appropriate hardware is presen (single picture recording
with non-linear editing system like the DraCo).
</P><P>
With the information button you can show the data of the animation. Here
you will be informed something about the used effects, the profile of the
animation, the number of frames and the playing speed, how many pixels are
in the frames and in which colour depth the rendering process was. You are
also informed about the rate of compression. Why the display fields are
editable is not revealed here, that's why that's a mystery for the tester,
yet...
</P><P>
The menu &quot;Window&quot; is completed with the settings for a playing
cache, that buffers pictures and can be manipulated in its MB size. In
addition you can setup, that an animation is only started after pressing
the space bar (and also stopped), to make an output on video easier.
</P><P>
The quality of the demo animations is different. Due to the repeating of
the basic motive (the character &quot;WF&quot; rotate in front of a
purpur pulsing background) it gets a bit boring. On the other hand this
shows the &quot;theme with variations&quot; with the various effects
Wildfire offers, quite good. There are shown animations of the 2D and 3D
range. This is done with linear and non-linear computing. This is one of
the innovations in Wildfire. Up to now you had to learn the use to the
sometimes very tricky script list in a &quot;linear&quot; way to
control it. Many effects of Wildfire\7 (the so-called NLFX - non-linear
effects) can be merged in a non-linear way. So you need not care about
the buffers, Wildfire manages for in- and output of picture data. You
move picture thumbnails into the input and combine them with the effects
and move the result into a window, which stands for the output buffer.
Nice and efficient for a number of standard effects, which are &quot;just&quot;
computed by Wildfire\7.
</P><P>
For a lot of more complex computing processes (especially the 3D animations)
still need the linear arrangement in the effectlist (the session script).
So you can switch betwenn both modes. The effects in the effect list are
marked, so you get an orientation, which are for lineare list and which
are for the non-linear list.
</P><P>
The demo drawers on the Wildfire-CD contain even more!
&quot;Timeline&quot;, &quot;Transitions&quot; and &quot;Without Sessions&quot;
which unfortunately have some distortions, you ignore with pleasure due to
the great variety, which bring a lot of inspirations.
</P><P>
Interesting are the examples of the drawer &quot;ImageFX3&quot; which
served as animation deliverer and works fine with Wildfire. Maybe a drawer
&quot;Movieshop&quot; could be added, which could contain ARexx scripts
for communication with the editing software for the VLabMotion and the DraCo.
Then it would be possible to use Wildfire &quot;operators&quot; directly
in the timeline of Movieshop.
</P><P>
</P><P>
 Pulldown menu &quot;PlugIns&quot;
</P><P>
PlugIns extensions of the program, which can be additionaly &quot;built-in&quot;.
The plug-ins can be made by the program author, but with making the plug-in
interface public it can be expected, that many external programmers help to
extend the possibilities of the software. The documentation of Wildfire\7
shows all the ARexx commands, which can &quot;remote control&quot; the
program. Some of these &quot;controls&quot;, like e.g. the fading generator
(Transition maker) are included.
</P><P>
At this place it's not the plug-ins for effects, that are interesting, but
the general functions, which can be added or removed by selection. After
adding and selecting the &quot;menu button&quot; all the plug-ins are added.
So they are integrated only temporary into the program and need memory only
if wanted.
</P><P>
A preview to the effect section: Not just a little bit the plug-in
possibilities of the classics like PhotoShop, After Effects or Premiere
helped for this nearly &quot;standard&quot; software to succeed. The
concept of Wildfire is quite similar with its plug-in drawer, but later
more in this matter!
</P><P>
It would be nice, if the plug-ins of the PC and Mac-world could be used.
But licence fees and the differences of the processors will not make this
possible. But the the PPC version of Wildfire should be able of this, if
you consider the Apple version of the named programs...
</P><P>
Maybe someone writes a converter for this matter.
</P><P>
</P><P>
 Pulldown menu &quot;Save modules&quot;
</P><P>
Here you can view and manipulate the save modules of Wildfire. Currently
they are present for the file types EPS, ILBM, JPEG, PNG and PPM. All of
them can be manipulated using the &quot;Settings&quot;, especially the
compression. Why JPEG allows only 95% as a maximum value puzzles me.
The input to non-linear editing systems can handle the nearly hidden
100% setting and would gain a slightly better quality with current data
reduction. It should be possible to change this, especially for the
&quot;purists&quot; with a DraCo, extended on a maximum level. Even if there is the ILBM
(so it's IFF) output which is without compression. But then you have to
read more data...
</P><P>
An output to TIFF would be fine, to implement the Apple- and PC-platforms,
which programs like Photoshop and especially After Effects handle TIFF best.
Using the datatype this could easily added, due to the fact that they are
supported without further ado. Credit point!
</P><P>
Start screen of Wildfire
</P><P>
The start screen is, as mentioned, visible at once and show an index card,
which is divided into three parts, to the user. The project menu is first.
There are presented to fixed windows: The input- and the output window,
which Wildfire names &quot;Stream&quot;.
</P><P>
In the current revision 7 there is a commercial window in the output window
which changes randomly. If this is necessary is to discuss. It is quite
irritating, especially in the beginning. But due to the low price one or
the other Wildfire user might grumble, but most will accept. Unfortunately
this is a usual experience!
</P><P>
Who don't know the Microsoft-cartoon: &quot;This error message is sponsored by Budweiser!&quot;
</P><P>
In the input stream you setup, which is to be used for input. This is done
in the window &quot;Type&quot; and defines, that the input is an animation (YAFA,
Quicktime, AVI, MPEG1, MPEG2 or IFF). Single pictures from a list
(e.g. from a single picture output of an editing system like the one of
the DraCo with its Movieshop) can be selected second. Here you can load
pictures in ILBM, JPEG, PPM and PNG format, but also use the pictures
of the available Amiga datatypes. Quite often of importance are &quot;black pictures&quot;
for special arrangements. These can be created and loaded using the third
selection point. In the picture sequences there are also lists, which are executed
one after the other, and whose pictures can be loaded. In the first case
you select the pictures manually and collect them in a list, which has to
be sorted and edited generally before making it available to the program for
execution. In the last case the series of pictures is imported by Wildfire
due to setting of a start- and an end point. But it is possible to exclude
pictures from editing or to put out special areas of the rendered animation
using the &quot;Area&quot; controls. I expect this not to be present anywhere else!
</P><P>
How Wildfire works should be understood, so you have to care, in addition
to that, about the creative part only.
</P><P>
Both of the named windows (streams) show the principle quite fine. In the
left window you define, which are input data Wildfire shall use. Via the
picture type you define, which kind of data you want to load. In &quot;Settings&quot;
the number resp. the name of pictures are adopted. Using &quot;Output-Stream&quot; you
define the path of the output data. With &quot;Type&quot; the type of output. There
is the possibility to compute YAFA-, IFF or MPEG1/2 animations, to output
the animation as single pictures or to display it only. A GIF animation
put into brackets in the menu was eliminated due to the licencing problems.
</P><P>
There is to mention, that you  can select the modern MPEG2 for output.
In how far this is compatible with the DVD standard, which is described
as MPEG-2 MP@ML by the IPB norm is not mentioned and is then up to the
try-and-error of the beta testers. Due to the lack of a DVD player resp.
writer (who could lend me the last one for a weekend?) I cannot answer
this question, yet.
</P><P>
Any of the output formats can be adjusted via parameters. So you can define
the compression of the picture data, the colour selection, generate a time code,
manipulate the speed of the picture display duration as well as defining the
colour data using RAW or Chunky, which is a speed manipulating due to the
opimization of the animation, with the YAFA animation,
</P><P>
But first we want to edit a single picture with Wildfire. We select
&quot;New&quot; from the project menu to reset any previous inputs. The effect
menu is emptied, else (this is one of Wildfires' strong points) a
present script (session) could be used for the new input data. In this
case Wildfire automatically recognizes the changing sizes resp. picture
numbers and fits the script to the new input data, if wanted. Brilliant!
</P><P>
As indicated, we want to use a single picture, first. With this an effect
should be generated and saved as a YAFA animation. It is important to
distinguish between loading a single picture into the &quot;picture list&quot; or
as a &quot;Sequence&quot;. If you load a picture into the picture list and add no
more this is just a single picture, which is handled as a single picture
in the output. So you cannot render any animations, but effects on this
one picture, which is in memory. If you want to generate an animation you
have to load this single picture as a &quot;Picture sequence&quot;. In the small
preview window of the project index card you notice the picture to be
loaded as a thumbnail. The pre-setting for the sequence to compute is
60 frames. This can be changed with a click on &quot;Settings&quot;. All the
variables are adjusted, if wanted, because Wildfire is able to load the
data (pictures) with a already present script and run the script &quot;on them&quot;.
In this case the size and number of pictures is adjusted to the changed
conditions. So it is possible without any problems to use a script, what
expects the resolution of 320x240, but the new picture data contain
single pictures with a resolution of 640x480. Wildfire adjusts the
script to these new conditions. The saves much time and work and is
really exemplary.
</P><P>
The setting of 60 pictures is enough for the first excercises. On one
hand it is decisive, how large the pictures are, on the other hand
many single pictures there are within the animation, to get quick
results within the test stage. 60 single picture are approx. two and a
half seconds in PAL (two seconds in NTSC) and due to the always active
endless loop there can be created nice effects.
</P><P>
Below in the window you see the run bar for the single pictures,
which can be moved between 1 and 60. The &quot;Test&quot; button allows to watch
the screen on the set screen. Moving the slider of the run bar makes
it possible to &quot;test&quot; and watch any picture. The subpoint &quot;Operation&quot;
contains the value &quot;linear&quot;. If you click on &quot;Render preview&quot; the
sequence of 60 frames is rendered without the effect &quot;linear&quot; in a
preview, which is shown in a small (50% large) preview window.
The size of the preview window can be selected, of course as well as
the screen, where it shall be displayed. If the colour depth of the
result of the rendering is higher than the selected screen Wildfire
automatically switches to the best mode. Nice!
</P><P>
But let's return to our single picture: If you would like to generate
this sequence of a no-motion-picture to an animation you enter the
&quot;Output stream&quot;-window, select the type of output, in this case
&quot;YAFA-Animation&quot; and enter the path and filename, you want to save
the result. With &quot;Settings&quot; in the output window you can define the
type of compression. If you set the preview window to &quot;Window output&quot;
the animation is rendered after clicking on &quot;Convert&quot;, written to
hard disk and shown in the window of the Wildfire screen at the same
time.
</P><P>
The progress of the rendereing is displayed in a percent scale as usual.
It is possible to cancel the operation and watch the time left. During
the rendering and after that the screen is &quot;dirty&quot;, because it is not
being refreshed, at least under CyberGraphX 2.1. This can be corrected
manually with moving the windows. Forget it! But it should be corrected,
anyway.
</P><P>
As with the included YAFA anims it is possible to load the just
rendered with the anim displayer. The animation of 60 frames is played
endless. You can see the no-motion-picture without stuttering on the
screen, when Wildfire plays directly from the hard disk. Of course,
(depending on the size of the anim and of the RAM) it is also possible
to play the anims from the Ram Disk.
</P><P>
Of course, it is not very exciting, to create an animation of a
still picture. It would also be possible to display the picture using
a picture view and to save lots of CPU time;-)
</P><P>
So, we start to work:
</P><P>
We want to animate a picture, let's say in a resolution of 320x256 pixels,
because it should not take too much time and we can watch the result quickly.
</P><P>
Wildfire knows a large number of animation possibilities:
Starting with easy fadings (transitions), timeline actions, which allow
setting of the actions about the time, actions controlled with ARexx,
linear and non-linear effects, which can be processed in 2D or in 3D up
to animation import of other programs like ImageFX, ADPro, raytracers...
</P><P>
Let's begin the easy way and process a transition (a fading). E.g.
with a moving out of the screen from the left to the right... There is
another picture to appear below the moving picture.
</P><P>
Because Wildfire starts with a loading path where the program takes its
demo picture and the clipboard is filled with various data (at least with
this revision) we want to create a &quot;virgin&quot; start session.
With the program settings (project menu) we select our public screen to
make previews displayed there. As we read above, Wildfire\7 forgets
this screen and takes always Workbench. In the settings of the program on
the index card &quot;Directories&quot; a path to a picture viewer can be entered. This
is practically to be able to test the loaded picture data quickly.
</P><P>
To generate a start session without contents we delete the path line
in the input stream and the clipboard contents in the window menu. In
addition we select &quot;New&quot; in the project menu. In the output stream it
is possible to enter a target path for the future animation and define
settings for the preview screen. Everything is saved in the data of the
session.
</P><P>
The just created (empty) project is to be saved. Future tries can begin
on the basis of this &quot;empty session&quot;.
</P><P>
We quit Wildfire and restart it, load the empty session and notice, that
Wildfire is ready for the own creations. But unfortunately the clipboard
is filled again.
</P><P>
A bug, which should also be removed. Irritating is also, that if you
forget to clear this clipboard an &quot;alien&quot; picture is in a buffer and
is used by Wildfire for the animation.
</P><P>
First we set the input stream type to &quot;Picture sequence&quot;, load a picture
and change the presets in &quot;Settings&quot; to 100 pictures, what is about
4 seconds in PAL (3 1/3 seconds in NTSC), if necessary. We answer the
question, if the variable should be changed with &quot;Yes&quot;. Now we got
our first picture in the buffer &quot;stream&quot;.
</P><P>
Now we need another picture, which has to go into the first temporary
buffer (Temp1). This is the picture, which is to appear below the moving
picture. The necessary operator for this loading action is to find in
the buffer effect types and is named &quot;LoadImage&quot;. Double clicking or
dragging the effect window (index card &quot;Effect&quot;) moves the first effect
operator into the session script. NOw we have to define the picture
file, which is to be loaded by the LoadImage operator: double click
on  the operator in the list and a menu opens. We define the output of
the picture into the buffer Temp1 and enter the path where the picture
is located. Then we close the window.
</P><P>
Now we have to tell Wildfire what has to be used as a background of the
roll animation with help of the &quot;SetBackground&quot; operator. The operator
is to find in the type &quot;Various&quot;. You can set, if a picture is to be used
as a background, and if so in which buffer it is. Because we loaded our
background picture into the buffer &quot;Temp1&quot; we set Temp1, of course. If
you want just a colour as background, this is also possible. Then you
have only to leave away the LoadImage operator.
</P><P>
But the actual effect is to come:
</P><P>
We want to roll the picture out of the window from the left to the right.
For this purpose we enter the operator window again and get nearly
crazy due to the large numbers of effects. These are divided into buffer-,
colour-, 2D- and 3D- as well as into particle effects. In addition there
are effects, which can't be put into one of these categories. These are
to find in &quot;Various&quot;. The effect window is divided into two parts. In
the upper part we select an effect type of the just numbered classes.
After that we notice the selection of the effects, which belong to
the effect type class in the part below. To roll the picture we need
a 2D effect. We click on &quot;2D&quot; in the type window and then on &quot;Roll&quot; in
the part below. Immediately the Thumbnail of the effect window changes at once
and shows a sample picture with the the expected result of the effect.
Effects that can't shown on that way are represented by a question mark.
Maybe this is changed with the next update of Wildfire\7, because this
doesn't look very nice.
</P><P>
Our script- resp. session list shows three entries, by now. With the
help of &quot;Test&quot; it is possible to select and to render a preview picture,
which can be adjusted with a slider. &quot;Preview&quot; puts the preview picture
on the screen and - at last - clicking on &quot;Render preview&quot; of the index
card &quot;Project&quot; starts rendering the complete animation into the preview
window, which is done very quick. With the slider of the preview window
it is possible to run through the animation manually.
</P><P>
You should continously save the session. If the preview has been created
without errors it is possible to render the &quot;real&quot; animation with clicking
on &quot;Convert&quot;. It is being saved on the defined path and is available at
once for playing with the YAFA player.
</P><P>
With this method you can create numerous animations. No matter, if in 2D
or in 3D. Computed sequences of single pictures can be used for the
Wildfire creations. Actually there are only limitations due to your
phantasy. The tools for the enormous variety of effects and picture
manipulation are present. Now it is just to get exercised and practice
to use the offered possibilities.
</P><P>
The playing with the 3D-effects, which could be adjusted over parameters
would last for weeks and the descriptions of the varieties would fill
complete books! The results of these plug-ins are enormous. Highlited
rotating 3D-structures, plasma clouds with just a few mouse clicks.
Particle effetcs and whirls, which sink into the nebula or are moved
away by wind and waves! An all this rendered to moving pictures, if the
required digital picture material is present. Even the Movieshop software
of the DraCo resp. the VLabMotion, which is actually brilliant, doesn't
offer the possibilities, Wildfire is able to offer. Due to the enormous
possibility to parameter gives free reign to the variations. Once found
&quot;formulae&quot; can be saved and used again and again, cause you quickly lost
it as you found it, if you really start playing...
</P><P>
I'm planning to create a nice demo video with help of the DraCo and
Wildfire\7 including a workshop. If you are interested, you can call
me per eMail (*) with wishes and suggestions!
</P><P>
The possibility to control Wildfire and its parameters via ARexx allows
modular extensions, which could result in effects not even thought about.
Basically everything you know from the movies and the television is
possible. And the PowerPC platform, which enters the Amiga offers the
necessary computing power without any doubt!
</P><P>
With analysing the included animations, as well as the &quot;raw data&quot;
of the session script of all rendered demo animations you can quickly
get own results (with modification of the picture data). With changing
of the many, nearly not countable parameters you get seduced to experiment.
And that's fun!
</P><P>
Actually, during the test stage Wildfire\7 1.0 seemed to be quite stable.
Nearly no crashes appeared. And if, the author of this small test admits
he is to blame due to &quot;unqualified clicking&quot;...
</P><P>
The online documentation should corrected due to typing errors. In addition
an extended manual, which explains the exact use of the plug-ins, is most
likely to be welcome. The beginner is oversupplied and has to figure out
the &quot;internal logic&quot; of the buffer concept, to find out how the program
works.
</P><P>
Of course, Wildfire\7, as it appears, is unique on the Amiga. And
due to the price level of 300 DEM (approx. 153.06 Euro) unique about
the platform borders! I don't know a program like this neither in the
Mac- nor the PC-world, which creates the most brilliant special effects
on single pictures and animations. It is to hope, that many programmers
and tinkerers support the open concept with plug-ins and ARexx scripts,
so Wildfire is extended...
