<H2>6. Interview: Digital Images</H2>
<P>
This is an interview with Stuart Walker of Digital Images, the company, that
ports Wipeout 2097 for the Amiga and is working on many other games, even if
the firm exists since a short time on the Amiga market.

Your company is pretty new to the Amiga market. Why did you decide
to produce games for Amiga instead of PC?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
I have owned and used an Amiga for many years. Over the recent years, the
market seemed to get worse. I wanted to help revive this market and bring it
back to something that everyone could look upto again. By releasing high
quality titles, people can look at the Amiga and say, "Hey, the Amiga is
really good now! I want one!" The main thing that a platform needs to
succeed is good software titles. If the Amiga has good games, people will
change to Amiga. I have recieved eMails from people telling me that they
have changed from PC to Amiga after hearing our plans. We must be going in
the right direction!

In the last months many rumours of you and your company have been
told. Could you please tell us a) how many people you employ and what
they do b) if they work full-time for Digital Images ?
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
When Digital Images started, it was just myself, but over the last year and
a half we have expanded to 21 people. Several people are working full time,
but others are working in between other things. We are looking for more
people to help us in thier spare time with our titles as well!
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Amiga aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Are there any well-known Amiga programmers helping your company developing games?
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
There sure are! We have people like Peter McGavin, creator of ADoom and
Ruben Alcaniz who also writes Tales of The Heavan. We also have a large
number of people who *will *be well known after the Amiga community has
seen the kind of work they are doing.

Would you answer some questions about the PPC: a) what do you
prefer WarpOS or PPC.library? b) what do you think about Warp3D/
the PicasooIV voodoo extrension?
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
We will be supporting WarpOS. Warp 3D is excellent! Warp 3D is very fast and
it makes various things much easier. The Voodoo extension is great! We are
very pleased that enough pre-orders were made. Now, the Amiga will have the
kind of graphical power that PC owners will be able to marvel at!

<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Amiga aktuell international:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
What games do you plan to release in near future and what will
they require as the minimum configuration?
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
Space Station 3000 will be released within the next few months. This will
require an Amiga with either AGA or gfx card, 4Mb Fast RAM, CD-ROM drive
and the hard disk requirements will be announced soon. Space Station 3000 can
be pre-ordered from Blittersoft's (our publisher's) homepage at
 <A HREF="http://www.blittersoft.com">http://www.blittersoft.com</A> or by telephone on +44 (0)1908 261466 Wipeout
2097 will require an Amiga with AGA or gfx card, PPC, CD-ROM, around 16Mb
Fast RAM and the hard disk space will be announced soon. Pre-orders for
Wipeout 2097 will be available soon. Kjitsu Warriors and Digital Soccer are
on the way soon. Their system requirements will be announced at a later
date.

How long do you own an Amiga? What do you think of the futute of our computer?
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Stuart:&nbsp;</TD><TD>
I have owned an Amiga since 1989 when I got an A1500. I was really amazed
by the power of it and the quality of the software. The future of the Amiga
seems very positive and I am very sure that AI will pull off the Super
Amiga. It has the kind of specifications that are blowing every other
computer away and at a cheap price as well!
