</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Deepcore Entertainment published a damned good looking screenshot of their
new reference car race WildTracks. Who watches the screenshot might think that
it was made using a raytracer, but Deepcore quickly announced to publish a demo
version for the end of January. So you can expect it to be a real screenshot.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In the Aminet there are the first two ports of the PC-3D shooter Heretic
available for download. A port (AHeretic) is done by Jesper Svennevid, as
announced, and supports only 68k computers in the moment. But a PPC version
is to follow in the next days, because Jesper has to remove only a few bugs.
The other port (Heretic) is done by Sebastian Jedruszkiewicz  and is available
in two versions, for PPC and 68k. Both versions need the original PC WAD files,
either the shareware or the full version. The Shareware files can be found on
<A HREF="http://ftp.idsoft.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/">ftp.idsoft.com/pub/idgames/idstuff</A>
A progress report can be found in the next edition.

<P>
Diablo's Land, an arcade adventure with lots of 3D graphics and atmospheric music,
which makes the dungeon atmosphere quite realistic has been announced for April '99
The minimum requirements are 4 MB Fast RAM, AGA or graphics board and CD-ROM.
Another game is MegaPolice, a realtime strategy game where you are a police captain.
To make the streets save at night you have to deal with thieves, drug dealers and
to be quite smart. MegaPolice is expected to be released in summer, it will require
at least AGA or graphics board, 6 MB RAM and a CD-ROM drive.

<LI> Wasted Dreams now Distant Dreams
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Due to financial problems Digital Dreams Entertainment overtook the
Wasted Dreams Entwickler Digital FX. In addition they changed the name
to Distant Dreams. AGA or a graphics board, 3 MB RAM and a CD-ROM drive
are the minimum requirements for Distant Dreams. It is expected to be
published in the end of January. There are many improvements that have been
made and delayed the release date. So there's e.g. RTGmaster support built in, now.

And there's another new developer team, which needs help. Kinetic Creationz
plans to create the Amigas' anwer of Diablo 2 and is looking for StromC-programmers,
3D graphic designers (Lightwave) and professional musicians. The game will run on
PowerPC &amp; graphics boards only. If the team was complete a demo could be found on

<LI> The Last Seal of ANCOR
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The development of The Last Seal continues, but unfortunately there still
isn't support of graphics boards. The features of the adventure in the style of
Monkey Island seem to be brilliant: You can use 5 different perspectives, the
main character is made with more than 300 single pictures and there are only
raytraces backgrounds and lots of video sequences as well as voice output.
No wonder that you need at least 16 MB RAM. A release date hasn't been
announced.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
According to unconfirmed rumours Titan Computer cancelled these games:
Sword 2, Total Combustion, Lost Days in Paradise, Evils Doom Special Edition
unfortunately Shadow of the third Moon 2. Due to the fact I received this
message too late I could not ask Titan Computer, if this rumour is true.

</UL>
<P>
Delsyd Software is a new team of developers for the Amiga, which
plans 6 games. Delsyd set their hopes on the PowerPC processor. For this purpose
they started a survey on their homepage, so no-PPC-users should/can participate.
So take a quick look to: <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/foothills/2705" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/foothills/2705</A>.
In the momenty Delsyd Software works on these games:
The Adventures Of DP Dog, DP Tennis, DP Cart, Cross Country
Ralley and Destitution. The release dates have been announced (s. the
<A HREF="Spiele8.html">release list</A>). The game which will be released
first, in November 1999, is The Last Patriot and is a 3D game in the perspective
of a person. Every game of Delsyd Software are to run on PPC and really fine Amigas only.

<LI> Zambrosia by Crossbow
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A Quake clone is in work by the belgic company Crossbow. The features
are very promising: soft 3D scrolling, FMV sequences, breathtaking light effects
and graphics, as good as Quake. This game is being developped for 68k and PPC. The
minimum requirements are an 68040, 16 MB RAM, AGA and 6x CD-ROM. An optimum was a
PPC, 32 MB RAM and graphics board. I can't wait to see it.

<UL>
<LI> Source codes of Witches and Heretic published
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The source codes of Witches and Heretic have been published, recently.
Promptly Jesper Svennevid, who also ported SNES9x on the Amiga, announced
a port of both games. It is supposed he nearly completed the port and could
begin with the port of Witches. He is going to make two ports, anyway: one
for 68k and one for PPC. If you need further informations, ask
Jesper (<A HREF="mailto:chip@ramses.ml.org">chip@ramses.ml.org</A>).

<LI> More Foundation updates in work
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Paul Burkey is working busily on more updates for Foundation. This month
a version with a much more quicker graphic due to better graphics board
support is to be released. After that Paul is going to begin his work for
the network support.

<UL>
<LI> AHI comes for the PPC
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Okay, this news is not directly for the games section, but due to the fact
that AHI is used in most games, it might be quite interesting for most of you:
The author of AHI, Martin Blom, ports AHI for the PPC, because he bought a
PPC card thanks to a charity drive.

<UL>
<LI> NEX by Deflection
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The team of Marco Siegel currently works on NEX - The Dark Age.
The game is going to be like Bladerunner, but in 3D. Sounds quite interesting.
The 3D engine of NEX is said to be quite revolutionary due to MIP mapping,
texture filtering, coloured lights, lambert shading, polygon enemies and
weapons. The game supports the usage of Warp3D and Virge as well as Permedia2.
You should use at least a 68040, a graphics board is strongly recommended.
Of course, the PowerPC is supported. To complete the project there are C-programmers
looked for, so quickly call Marco Siegel &lt;<A HREF="mailto:marco.siegel@hal.regiocom.net">marco.siegel@hal.regiocom.net</A>&gt;
to make this game come true!
