<P>Amiga International are officially supporting this year's show, and
Petro Tyschtschenko has kindly donated a complete A1200 Magic Pack
along with an assortment of Amiga gear, all of which will be given away
to show goers throughout the day.

<P>The show will consist of a sale of Amiga hardware and software, games
competitions throughout the day, demonstrations of Amiga applications
and new hardware and the opportunity to join the Kickstart User Group.
In all it's a great day out where you can have fun, get help with your
Amiga problems and meet other Amiga users.

<P>What's on at the show:

<P>The second <A HREF="http://www.furry.demon.co.uk/kickstart_show/index.html">Kickstart Show</a> will be bursting with even more Amiga
activities than last year, showing both Amiga owners and their friends
exactly what the Amiga platform can REALLY do:

<P>Stands: Over 20 stands selling new and second-user Amiga software and
hardware. Commercial Amiga dealers include Snap Computers, who have
returned for a second year. Refreshments will also be on sale and a
Kickstart membership stand will also be on hand to answer questions and
handle membership inquiries from show-goers.

<P>If you would like to take a stand, please contact us using the details
below. Do hurry, as the sales floor is almost completely sold out!

<P>Competitions: Amiga International are supporting the show by offering a
complete A1200 Magic Pack (worth £200) for the grand draw, which each
show-goer will be automatically entered into. There will also be
various Amiga giveaways throughout the day and great prizes for the
various gaming contests planned.

<P>Games: Four gaming competitions are planned: A multiplayer Doom
tournament (with as many as five simultaneous players in each game),
Quake running on PowerPC-based A1200s and A4000s, A Sensible Soccer
tournament and a Skidmarks contest (with as many as eight simultaneous
players in each game).

<P>Demonstrations: On show will be new hardware innovations, such as the
AteoBus busboard and Pixel64 graphics card, the now infamous Suzanne
A600 laptop and a large array A1200, A4000 & A600 tower conversions.
Kickstart members will also be demonstrating various applications,
including Word Processors, Desktop Publishing, Graphics and Animation
tools, Operating System enhancements and much much more. Also see Mac
emulation under Fusion, PC Emulation under PCX and Amiga emulation
using Amiga Forever.

<P>AmigaSoc: Representatives from the AmigaSoc organization will be on
hand at the show, operating their shareware registration program. At
the show AmigaSoc will be able to offer a range of shareware programs
that can be registered then and there without having to worry about
currency conversions or sending off travelers cheques to far flung
corners of the globe.

<P>Magazine launch: Being unveiled at the Kickstart Show will be the first
issue of the new Kickstart magazine Amiga Insight. This magazine,
produced totally by club members on Amiga hardware, will have a monthly
mix of news, product reviews, tutorials and informed debate about the
latest Amiga topics - indeed everything from the future of OS3.5 to why
880K floppy disks should be killed off for good!
