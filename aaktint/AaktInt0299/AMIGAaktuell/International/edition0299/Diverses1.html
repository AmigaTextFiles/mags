Frequently Asked Questions<BR>
--------------------------
</P>
<P>
This document is designed to inform you of some questions that may have already been
answered before, regarding aMozilla. It is generally bad practice to ask this question
again, so please read this FAQ before asking and questions :-)
</P>
<P>
1) I signed up to be a beta-tester. Have I been confirmed?
</P>
<P>
Yes. All people who signed up as a beta tester have been accepted to the Beta Test WG.
You will be informed at a later date as to how you are to go about Beta-Testing aMozilla.
</P>
<P>
2) Isnt aMozilla supposed to be Open Source?
</P>
<P>
Yes. aMozilla is Open-Source, we have never said it will not be. However, we have decided
to exercise our right to ensure that the program is working correctly before public release.
The beta testers will have access to all versions of aMozilla v0.1 through v0.9. At Version 1
the aMozilla code will be made public, as well as an executable version.
</P>
<P>
We have made this decision, because we feel that it best suits the needs of this project. We know
Mozilla doesnt work like this, but please trust us on this decision. We believe it will lead to a more
stable release of aMozilla in the first place, rather than the buggy Mozilla's on other platforms.
</P>
<P>
3) Why StormC?
</P>
<P>
At the very begining of this project, some of the coders expressed the opinion that everyone should
be using the same Compiler to ensure maximum compatibility. The decision was made that if possible, StormC
would be the best compiler, as it would allow us to easily port the code to PPC, and make use of WarpUp.
</P>
<P>
I then contacted Haage + Partner regarding this, and they very kindly promised us some copies of StormC, and the
development team will be receiving this soon.
</P>
<P>
4) Will aMozilla use NGLayout?
</P>
<P>
Yes, aMozilla will use NGLayout, as quite simply it is the only option. It is very quick, very advanced
and will be constantly evolving to support new standards. The nature of aMozilla is to allow these
changes to be *EASILY* implemented with just an update script.
</P>
<P>
5) What GUI will aMozilla use?
</P>
<P>
Initially, aMozilla will use MUI, as it is easy and quick to develop for, enabling us to release a working
version of aMozilla as early as we intend.
</P>
<P>
In future, after V1.0, we intend to implement a dual GUI system, similar to that seen in Miami. This should enable
us to use the XPFE technology, and possibly another Amiga GUI system.
</P>
<P>
6) What machine will I need?
</P>
<P>
We are anticipating the minimum specification to be an 68030 Processor, with 8mb RAM.
</P>
<P>
aMozilla will require either AGA or a GFX card.
</P>
<P>
7) When can I expect to see Version 1.0?
</P>
<P>
Version 1.0 (the first public release), should be available at the World of Amiga Show 1999, we are
confident of meeting that deadline.
</P>
<P>
8) How much will aMozilla cost?
</P>
<P>
aMozilla will cost nothing, we are unable to sell it, and we wouldnt want to sell it even if we could.
</P>
<P>
9) What about Java/Javascript?
</P>
<P>
aMozilla will definitely support Javascript, and will almost certainly support Java. We are currently
evaluating whether to support Kaffe or Electrical Fire.
</P>
<P>
10) What about Plugins (Real Video, Real Audio, Shockwave)?
</P>
<P>
We are unable to promise support for any of these plugins, although we are in negotiations to purchase
licences to implement the technology into aMozilla.
</P>
<P>
To raise the money we will sell advertising on the web site, and aMozilla t-shirts. If you want to see
these plugins, please support us financially, we cannot do it otherwise.
</P>
