<H2>4. A.C.T. decides about future presence on the Amiga market</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Final decision about future presence of A.C.T. on the Amiga market
</P>
<P>
M.  Albrecht, founder and head of the company A.C.T. is collecting informations about the interests of the Amiga community for existing and
future developments of his company in a Web survey. Even if A.C.T. is present usually on the audio sector, they also offer USB and MultiIO
controllers. If the number of interested people should be lower than a limit, A.C.T. doesn't see any possibility to stay present on the Amiga
market.
</P>
<P>
A participation on this survey doesn't include an advanced booking of the products. Mr. Albrecht told us, that when reaching the necessary
minimum number of interested people those are contacted, who entered their eMail address and are asked for an advanced booking as well
as advanced payment. The necessery number of orders are quite low (1000 to 2000 pieces depending on the project) and they are all needed
for a save financing of the projects. Any Amiga user with Internet access is asked to consider a participation, because the result of this
survey doesn't only decide about the actions of A.C.T., but is directed to other firms and developers for helping them to decide.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
The survey can be found on <A HREF="http://www.act-net.com" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.act-net.com</A>. It runs up to May 20th.
Then they will decide, which products to develop. Even now A.C.T. announced, that it is most likely, that the USB (Universal-Serial-Bus) controller
will be produced. Three versions have been planned: one for ZorroII-Amigas, one as AddOn for the sound card Prelude and on as AddOn for
the Ethernet card AriadneII.
