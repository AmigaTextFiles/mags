<H2>6. Photogenics is back!</H2>
<P>
Presumed ones live longer, we Amiga users know that. This is also true for the well-known picture editing software Photogenics, we didn't
hear of for a long time. But Photogenics wants a comeback:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Photogenics 4
</P>
<P>
After 4 years of hard work, Paul Nolan finally published the new revision of the well-known and loved picture editing software Photogenics.
</P>
<P>
Photogenics is a graphics package, which allows you to create phantastic pictures from nowhere or the edit existing pictures. It can be used
for various functions from simple file converting to advanced photo manipulation and picture touch ups. It offers extremely realistic painting
tools like e.g. chalk and water colour to create phantastic master pieces in minutes.
</P>
<P>
Numerous new functions allow never expected experiments with the graphic design.
</P>
<P>
The list of the new features:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Changing of the colours, transparency of the picture editing mode and the position of the drawn in real time.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Realistic tools like airbrush, chalk, pen water colours and also smear functions.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Various symmetry and text tools.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Best work results also when using a standard mouse.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Working without time stealing masking with any of the painting tools. You can choose between 3 dozens of work modes.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Easy erasing of errors with the right mouse button without altering the good parts.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Unlimited number of layers allow an efficient picture composition.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Phantastic pyrotechnic paint techniques like lens flares, fire and explosions. Combined with the smear tool you can produce
Supernovae, waves of fire and even sun sets and waterfalls.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Innovative user interface with freely positionable elements.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Full multithreading: No waiting, many effects in real time.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Advanced, but easy useage of the alpha channel. Use any picture as a mask or just draw it on a picture. Changes on the mask are
displayed in real time in the main picture.
</LI>
<BR><LI> 24-bit-alpha channels. Only Photogenics offers the possibility to us colour alpha channels, which allow a masking of red, green and
blue. Drawing with gray creates common masks. Create unusual effects with the useage of 24-bit-alpha channels for masking picture editing effects.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Symmetry tool - allows incredible effects in combination with the paint tools in seconds.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Text tool - Just click anywhere into the picture and write into a paint layer. The text is fully editable until it has been fixed on the
lower picture.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Multiple display with various magnification factors.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Impressive colour manipulation with 5 colour selectors, RGB and HSV slides. You can use colours from pictures, with the changes
becoming visible in real time.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Extended file format support. Current formats to be loaded and saved are IFF-ILBM, IFF-DEEP, JPEG, Targa, TIFF, BMP and PNG,
but more formats will follow. Photogenics also supports loading using 24-bit datatypes.
</LI>
<BR><LI> 24-Bit print support using Studioprint.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Open plug-in architecture for easy extendability of third parties. Photogenics is basicly a collection of plug-ins, which form a program
without transition. Third party developers can access the same API as Photogenics, what allows developers to write any extension of the
program core.
