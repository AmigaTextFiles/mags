<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
This is the May edition of the games section of AMIGA aktuell international. To tell you the sad news right to the beginning:
Settlers II for the Amiga has been definitely cancelled. The reasens for this decision sound like excuses, but what is
the motive of Blue Byte? I'm sure, this question is asked by many Amigans. So they tell us, it would be too much work to
give all the graphics and sounds to Titan Computer. But the worst is, that Titan computer completed the complete engine
for Settlers 2 and doesn't get the graphics now. Why wasn't that made clear before? Unfortunately, I don't know it either...
</P>
<P>
Well, this month was quite boring regarding game news, again. There were some news, but nothing earth-shattering (in opposition
to the other Amiga news, there were some). I personally can't hardly wait for the games of Digital Images. The developer team
is working for so many projects and the first ones are to be published soon. If they can keep their promises, Digital Images
will become one of the most interesting companies for Amiga games in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There were also some discussions this month: Manni Froitzheim gave his view to some comments regarding his test reports.
In addition Wolfgang W. Wolber commented the test report. I made just a short comment below Mannis report in this edition.
</P>
<P>
And then there's something to tell regarding the Tomb Raider 2 announcement from Looflirpa Entertainment in the last
edition: It was, unfortunately, an april joke. 'Loopflirpa' is written backwards and means 'Aprilfool'....It seems, that
only Wolfgang W. Wolber noticed it, at least he sent me a mail regarding this theme. It's a pity, Tomb Raider 2 on the
Amiga would have been nice ;-)
</P>
<P>
There aren't any reviews this month again. Even if 'The Prophet' was published, I don't have any test sample available.
More regarding this theme in the previews section.
</P>
<P>
The Charts section hasn't been actualized this month, because I didn't get later data than the ones from March 2, 1999.
So wait for the next edition, maybe there will be an actualized version, then.
</P>
<P>
And now something private: Markus Tillmann asked me to help him with the 5th mission of Napalm. Unfortunately I didn't play
Napalm up to this level and so I hope, that someone of you completed the 5th mission. So this is the original question of
Markus:
</P>
<P>
'I cannot complete the 5th mission successfully. O.K., I'm not the big strategist, but I play this mission for weeks
and tried nearly anything to complete this mission, even 60 tanks and a dozend of soldiers didn't lead to access.
</P>
<P>
And now it begins to nerv, I want to continue.
</P>
<P>
Can you give me a tip, how I can complete this mission successfully with the humans?
</P>
<P>
If someone has an idea I would be grateful, if he sent it directly to Markus Tillmann &lt;<A HREF="mailto:golz@online-club.de">golz@online-club.de</A>&gt;
or, of course, to me - I will forward it then.
</P>
<P>
So have fun with this edition,
</P>
