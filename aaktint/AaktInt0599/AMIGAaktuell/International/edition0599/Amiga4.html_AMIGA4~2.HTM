<H2>4. Meeting with Jim Collas and Petro Tyschtschenko</H2>
<P>
Some weeks ago AMIGA invited the hard and software developers, dealers, representatives of Amiga clubs as well as the
commercial press for April 27 to a meeting with AMIGA president Jim Collas and vice president Petro Tyschtschenko for
Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Petra Struck, known from the German Amiga News (<A HREF="http://www.amiga-news.de" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.amiga-news.de</A>),
was there as a representative of the &quot;Amiga-Club im BTX und Internet&quot;. This is her short report:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;
On April 27, in Frankfurt there was a meeting between Jim Collas and dealers, developers, press and user groups. Jim Collas
introduced himself to the Amiga scene, informed the present persons in detail about the strategy and plans of the realisations
of the AmigaNG, answered the questions of anybody and has had an idea of the scene in Germany. He followed ideas and suggestions
and addressed the statements of some persons intense.
</P>
<P>
I saw Jim Collas as a man, who is very charismatic and is able to change things. In his long speech I felt, that
he is 'infected' by the &quot;Spirit of Amiga&quot;. With know-how and power he wants to make his targets reality,
that are scheduled and which are clearly structurized, but also revolutionary. A man with visions, farsightedness
and especially with competence.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the last years, after that many promisses, I got the feeling, that something really happens, now;
the nearly stopped train Amiga is moving again. I don't believe, that I exaggerate, if I say, that we can look forward
to a phantastic Amiga future.&laquo;
