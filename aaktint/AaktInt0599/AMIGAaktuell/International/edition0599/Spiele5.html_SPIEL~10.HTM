<H2>5. Preview: Nuxelia</H2>
<P>
&quot;Nuxelia? Wasn't there a preview before?&quot; This question might be asked by many of you and you are right,
Nuxelia was already introduced in the March edition. But in this edition it was the first revision of the preview.
Meanwhile a second was released, which has some major changes. So back to the preview: Especially the graphics changed.
Many things are quite colourful now. And many technical difficulties have been solved, so the game becomes much easier.
Even if the graphics doesn't pull out your socks it has been designed fine and not amateurlike like other current
games. Nuxelia is a Jump'n'Run in the style of Wonderboy/Mario and it is fun. But in the moment it is a bit too easy.
By the way, the developer team is looking for a publisher. If you are interested contact Erik Gustavsson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:zik@craze.nu">zik@craze.nu</A>&gt;.
The conclusion is the same: Nuxelia could become a really fine Jump'n'Run game!
