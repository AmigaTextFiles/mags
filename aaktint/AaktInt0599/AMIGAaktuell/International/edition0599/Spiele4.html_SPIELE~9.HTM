<LI> The Settlers 2 won't come for the Amiga
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Well, as bad as it sounds: The Settlers for the Amiga seems to be cancelled. The reason seems to be Blue Byte, because it
was 'too much work' to give the graphics and sounds to Titan. Titan Computer now has a complete engine and now the graphics
and sounds are missing. This is annoying. Shortly after it was released an initiative was startled, that has the target
to change Blue Bytes's mind. You can vote on  <A HREF="http://www.angusm.demon.co.uk/AGDB/Sett2.html" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.angusm.demon.co.uk/AGDB/Sett2.html</A>.

New, impressive screenshots from Gilbert Goodmate have been published this month. According to Prelusion a graphic designer
of the team also works for Disney, what would justify the high graphics standard of the game.

</UL>
<P>
The ToAD (Gathering of Amiga Developers) team was founded in February and wants to offer the possibility to developers to
exchange experiences, ideas etc. and as a result to raise the standard of Amiga software. In addition GoAD works on a
remake of the C64 classic 'Cauldron'. The remake will be made freely available, if it's ready, so it is put into the
public domain. But they still need talented PowerPC C/C++ programmers, who like to work with such a project. If you are
interested contact Michael Flaherty &lt;<A HREF="mailto:michaelf@bakakaba.demon.co.uk">michaelf@bakakaba.demon.co.uk</A>&gt;.

<LI> Hired Guns level editor published
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Steve Hammond published a leveleditor for the known Amiga game Hired Guns, that was released by Psygnosis in 1993, on his homepage
after hard investigations. The level editor is to blow new life into the game. Everybody could create his own levels. It is
most likely, that the level editor is from Psygnosis and was written by the programmers of the company at that time. By the way,
Steve Hammond wrote the story of Hired Guns. The level editor can be downloaded from his Hired Guns site:

<P>
Alive Mediasoft published 'The Prophet' a game in the style of Dungeon Master. It's supposed to have more than 200,000
places, e.g. in the city, in the temple, at the graveyard etc. In addition there will be no route to follow, which means
you can go whereever you like. 'The Prophet' is available on Disk and CD-ROM and will be about 60.00 DEM (approx. 30.61 Euros).

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Surprisingly new screenshots of the game ACSYS, which was believed to be cancelled, appeared. In the final version there
will be up to 7 weapons, that can be shot within 360°. In addition there will be cool Sound FX, multidirectional parallax
scrolling as well as animated inter sequences. Momentarily the program needs 4 MB of RAM and a 4x CD-ROM. By the way, Unique
is looking for a musician. If you are interested contact Christian Sobotta &lt;<A HREF="mailto:christian.sobotta@rz.tu-ilmenau.de">christian.sobotta@rz.tu-ilmenau.de</A>&gt;.

</UL>
<P>
After a long time the website of Digital Images has been actualized. And so there are many news to report:
Space Station 3000 is as good as ready and a demo is to be released soon. In addition the Genetic Species 3D engine
is to be used, what is a fine change for a strategy game. The work for Wipe Out 2097 runs fine and screenshots will
be published in approx. 2 weeks. A demo is to follow soon. In addition Digital Images seems to plan Zeewolf 3. They
are negotiating with the original programmers of Binary Asylum, which is said to be fine. Digital Images is also
in negotiations with developers of some popular PC games (Heretic 2, Quake 2 &amp; F22: Air Dominance Fighters) for
porting them to the Amiga. And, of course, Digital Images is working on AmigaNG only games, where some Screenshots
wil be published soon.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Seaside from APC&amp;TCP is a game of theme park, but, as the name says, a type of holiday place at the beach has
to be managed. The game features sound bombastic: there are supposed to be more than 100 different land types,
1000 different decorations and 250 different beach types. In addition the environment is to change constantly.
A release date hasn't been published, yet.
