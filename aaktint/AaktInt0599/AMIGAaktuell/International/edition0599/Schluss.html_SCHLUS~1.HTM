Is the AmigaNG to be released in 1999?
</P>
<P>
Already this year the first Amigas of the next generation (also called AmigaNG or Amiga-II) are to be put on the market. But due to the
delays, which are usual in the computer branch, it has to be allowed to question the schedule.
</P>
<P>
If even giants of the computer branch usually delay the introduction of new product revisions, because the desired hardware or software
hasn't become ready due to not calculateable delays, why shouldn't we expect, that this can happen with a completely new product from a small company like
AMIGA? Because with this method we avoid the disappointment, if the highlight of the &quot;Show of superlatives&quot;, as the AMIGA vice president
Petro Tyschtschenko called the computer show in Cologne, that is to be in November 1999, isn't that phantastic.
As people say: Hope the best and expect the worst. Any Amiga user knows that due to our experiences of the last years and we should act that
way in the next months. A release of the Amigas of the next generation this month would be good  - but maybe too good to become true?
</P>
<P>
See you, next month!</P>
<P>
Yours,
