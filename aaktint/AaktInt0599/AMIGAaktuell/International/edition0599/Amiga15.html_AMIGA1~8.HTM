<H2>15. The Midwest Amiga Exposition</H2>
<P>

Many of you have emailed us asking whether or not the Amiga Central Ohio
Network will produce the 
Midwest Amiga Exposition for 1999.  At this time we will not be producing a
show for 1999.

Our show was created by everyday users for the sole purpose of supporting the
Amiga during some of it's 
roughest times.  In 1996, when we started our event, most other events had
closed their doors and an 
important role was left unfulfilled.  We felt we needed to support a
diminishing market during those times for 
other users and more importantly, developers.  

While some might argue, we believe we had a small role in helping the Amiga
trade show market in the U.S. 
become active again.  Amiga trade events are once again gaining popularity and
increasing in size, so rather 
than compete for exhibitors and attendees, we have decided it is time to step
aside and let others continue 
on.

The Amiga situation is currently more positive than in the past and we are
excited about the recent 
developments at Amiga Inc.  We will not rule out the possibility of bringing
back the Midwest Amiga 
Exposition in the years to come, but for now, we are confident that Amiga
trade shows in the U.S. are in 
competent and capable hands.

We have put together a scrapbook from each year of the Midwest Amiga
Exposition and we encourage 
you to visit our web site at http://www.amicon.org/mae.html and see what it
was like to be there.

There are simply too many people to thank in the end for what has become for
us, a personal chapter in the 
history of the Amiga.  Our debt of gratitude to the Amiga community and to the
developers that stuck it out 
is too large to measure.  

Sincerely,


David Pearce
President
The Amiga Central Ohio Network
