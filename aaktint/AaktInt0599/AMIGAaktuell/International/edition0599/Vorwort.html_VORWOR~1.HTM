Welcome to the new edition of AMIGA aktuell international.
</P>
<P>
In April AMIGA was in the headlines again. Now the company has e.g. a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who
was employed in a leading position in the most known computer companies of the world, like Apple, Borland,
Silicon Graphics and Sun.
</P>
<P>
In the PowerPC hardware range there are also interesting announcements:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Titan Computer, the turbo board manufacturer ACT as well as Haage &amp; Partner want to join their efforts to
put a G3 board for the Amiga on the market.
</LI>
<BR><LI> GVP-M also plans G3 boards
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Negative news are to hear from the German magazine market: Unfortunately one Amiga magazine is gone. After there were
rumours before, that the Amiga Fever was to be cancelled, it was announced in the last days of April, that the magazine
is integrated into the amigaOS without delay.
</P>
<P>
The internals of this edition:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> From now on an Express-HTML-edition of the German version of AMIGA aktuell will be made available normally on the last
day of each month on <A HREF="http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/Marko.Koscak/aakt/index.html" TARGET="_TOP">http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/Marko.Koscak/aakt/index.html</A>
This is a service for the subscribers of the HTML-edition, who want to read AMIGA aktuell just after it is finished.
</LI>
<BR><LI> AMIGA aktuell international can be contacted per Fax, now.
The Fax number is: +49 (0)89/66617-31176.
</LI>
<BR><LI> The Mailbox &quot;Big Planet&quot; where AMIGA aktuell could also be downloaded from went out of service.
</LI>
<BR><LI> There are two things I want to focus your attention to:
<UL>
<LI> Letters, that reach me per &quot;snail mail&quot; can only be answered, if you send enough return postage. I think,
you can follow the reasons, that the publisher and the editors of of a free, non-commercial magazine, cannot pay the porto
in addition to the large amount of work and Internet costs they have every month. I hope, you understand that.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Articles, that reach me per &quot;snail mail&quot; on paper or per fax, can be considered in special cases, only.
I think, that the publisher of an electronic magazine might expect to get articles in electronic form (per eMail or on disk).
No one can be expected to type in longer texts manually. I hope for your understanding also in this manner.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Our regulary summonses:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> We are looking for someone, who wants to do his/her own AMIGA aktuell international
column, that informs about software updates. Each month there are new
revisions for countless FD and commercial AMIGA programs. This new column
should list the most important improvements of new software updates.<BR>
Who is interested in, to do that?
</LI>
<LI> We are still looking for testers of freely distributable software.
Everybody who wants to do this job is filled into a special distribution
list, and gets ideas for tests in unregular intervals. You aren' obliged
to perform the tests.
<P>
  Of course, we are happy about tests of commercial products as well.
  Write an eMail to <A HREF="mailto:aakt@gmx.de">aakt@gmx.de</A> .
