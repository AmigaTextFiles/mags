<H1>Amiga</H1>
<H2>1. Spontaneous interview with AMIGA vice president Petro Tyschtschenko</H2>
<P>
</P>
Eastern`99
At  the  evening  of  the  third  day  at the Mekka&Symposium party suddenly the<BR>
general  manager  of Amiga International, Petro Tyschtschenko entered the stage,<BR>
took  the  microphone  and said some greetings to the Amiga fans around.  Better<BR>
say  to  the  less  fans left at the party as their part is becoming smaller and<BR>
smaller every year that passes.  (but that`s another story)<BR>
</P><P>
After  leaving  the stage Petro was speaking to Steeler and some other guys near<BR>
to  the  entrance.   Chavez  being  drunk  a bit had the spontaneous idea to ask<BR>
Tyschtschenko  if  he would agree to be interviewed.  We both wanted to make his<BR>
life  a  bit  harder asking him some uncomfortable questions about the more than<BR>
unsure  future  of  the  Amiga, about the faults made in the past etc.  etc.  So<BR>
read on what this real friendly man told us.<BR>
</P><P>

ø1 G&C: Hello and welcome to an interview  for the Amiga diskmag "Jurassic Pack".<BR>
ø1 Hey, greetings to you... how did you get here?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty:  Hello  and  happy  easter to you. I  came  here  by  car because I had to<BR>
 transport all the presents for the AMIGA scene.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: Aren't you being missed at home?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: Mhhh... yes, but I'm often on tour for my beloved AMIGA.  Thank Goodness,<BR>
 all members of my family have great understanding when it comes to this.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: At the moment  a lot is going on...  Phase5, Haage & Partner, Escena etc.<BR>
ø1 What will the future be like, in your opinion? Who will dominate the market?<BR>
ø1 (Also concerning projects like "Kosh", etc.)<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: All AMIGA fans are welcome. They will all make their way but I think there<BR>
 should  only  be  one  direction where we  all  should  go. Only united we are<BR>
 strong, separation only causes damages at the moment.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C:  How  come  you  are so committed?  Is  that  more a personal or business<BR>
ø1 oriented engagement?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty:  That  commitment is of a purely personal  nature.  I like to fight for an<BR>
 idea,  that's  the  only way to succeed  against  my  American friends. I have<BR>
 nothing to lose.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: At the moment I see  the danger of separation  of the already small Amiga<BR>
ø1 family.  Commitment  that goes in the right  direction  can't be wrong. But in<BR>
ø1 Poland,  for instance, the Amiga plays  a more important role, especially when<BR>
ø1 it comes to the demoscene.<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: Segregation? No. Kosh?  I've just had a great meeting with  J.H. Haage and<BR>
 Dietrich.  We agreed that Phase5 will do the new G3 board  and Haage & Partner<BR>
 on  the  other  side will develop the  68000 emulator...  so you see  there is<BR>
 harmony between us!<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C:  Haage & Partner will soon develop  OS 3.5, unless they are already doing<BR>
ø1 so.  This is all very good but nothing  visible to the public has happened for<BR>
ø1 quite  a  long  time. Isn't it already a  bit  too  late? Many Amiga fans have<BR>
ø1 already  switched  to  other platforms because  their  Amiga  was too old, for<BR>
ø1 example to PCs.<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: This is quite correct and sad  but the hard core will be preserved for the<BR>
 existing  platform.  And the people that have  left for PC will come back with<BR>
 flying  colours as soon as we will have started fighting against the monopoly!<BR>
 Just wait and see.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: We will do so...  We Amiga fans are quite used  to waiting for something.<BR>
ø1 Mhhh. What will your strategy be like?  What will the marketing look like, how<BR>
ø1 do you want to get market shares back?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty:  I too am accustomed to waiting for things. After all, Gateway did next to<BR>
 nothing  during the past two years. They needed the time to explore the Amiga.<BR>
 Now  they  have finally understood it. Money  is  one strategy we will need to<BR>
 regain  the  market. And Gateway will invest  that money. Secondly we need the<BR>
 management. And I think Jim Collas is the right person to bring back the Amiga<BR>
 to where it should have been for a long time, that is back to the top. Gateway<BR>
 are masters in marketing affairs.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: Lately Gateway  has reacted and exchanged  some leading persons,  also to<BR>
ø1 incrase the transparency of the company.  I've asked myself why a company that<BR>
ø1 produces PCs is interested in supporting a competing computer platform.<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: Our operating system is the key.  Gateway  has  now  realized  that and is<BR>
 going to take off.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: In how far  do you plan  to continue  to support  the so-called  "Classic<BR>
ø1 Amigas"?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: As long as I have something to say, always... and that will hopefully last<BR>
 for a long time.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: What do you think about organising  an "Amiga only" exhibition  in autumn<BR>
ø1 instead of the Computer '99 in Cologne?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty: Nothing.  We simply need the other people  in order to show them  how good<BR>
 and  unbeatable  we  are with a technology  that  hasn't had any novelty since<BR>
 1991.  I've already engaged myself for Cologne  and I promise you that it will<BR>
 be a superb exhibition.<BR>
</P><P>
ø1 G&C: Thanks a lot for this conversation  and thanks to Amiga International for<BR>
ø1 sponsoring our party last year (Cologne Conference '98). A last question: What<BR>
ø1 are your wishes for the future, regarding your private life, your professional<BR>
ø1 work, and the Amiga?<BR>
</P><P>
 Ty:  Our Amiga should finally get to the place where it ought to be. That's my<BR>
 most important target. Private: Health, so that I can continue to fight for my<BR>
 beloved  Amiga  for  a long time. And in  the  professional sense I wish for a<BR>
 product,  a  new one, something revolutionary  with  a thousand millions sales<BR>
 like we had in 1985 ... and that satisfies all users.<BR>
