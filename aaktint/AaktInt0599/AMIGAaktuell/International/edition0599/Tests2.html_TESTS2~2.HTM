<H2>2. Software test: Picture viewer 'Show' (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P>
</P>
&raquo;Where have all the pictures gone...
</P>
<P>
The picture displayer SHOW by Alain Renard
</P>
<P>
Even if the Amiga has lots of picture display programs there is another, that is introduced to you. On one hand, because it
is a CyberGraphX-only picture displayer, on the other hand, because there are some other features in addition to the ability
to display pictures on the monitor. So SHOW can also be used as a slideshow viewer or as a mini picture editing program.
</P>
<P>
This explains and justifies the enormous program size of approx. 500 KByte.
</P>
<H3>1. Requirements</H3>
<UL>
<LI> an Amiga (there aren't any informations about the required operating system in the documentation, but revision 2.04
should be the minimum due the CyberGraphX)
</LI>
<BR><LI> CyberGraphX
</LI>
<BR><LI> a fast processor, but even an 68000 can be used
</LI>
<BR><LI> enough memory, but also in this manner there aren't any informations in the documentation. Depending on the
picture size it should be possible to work even with 2 MB.
SHOW was tested under AmigaOS 3.1, CyberGraphX V3, Retina ZIII, 12+2 MB RAM and a 040/40 processor.
</LI>
</UL>
<H3>2. Installation</H3>
<P>
Here the user has to forego for an installation script and do it manually. In a mini text the necessary steps are listed
by the program author. Because there are just some files to be copied this shouldn'b be a problem even for beginners.
The program package includes the picture displayer SHOW as well as the program RANDOMFILES in a 68000 version as well as
in a 68040 version. In addition some libraries (gtlayout.library, ixemul.library and reqtools.library) are included and
have to be copied to LIBS:, if necessary.
</P>
<H3>3. Program description</H3>
<BR>
The current revision of SHOW can display pictures in these formats:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> JPEG (also progressive JPEGs</LI>
<LI> PNG</LI>
<LI> GIF</LI>
<LI> TARGA</LI>
<LI> BMP</LI>
<LI> PPM</LI>
<LI> TIFF</LI>
</UL>
and save in these formats:
<UL>
<LI> JPEG</LI>
<LI> PNG</LI>
<LI> TIFF</LI>
<LI> RAW.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It always opens a 16 or 24 bit CyberGraphX screen for displaying the pictures.
</P>
<P>
When starting SHOW first you get an error message about a missing Show.prefs file in the ENV: directory. But you shouldn't
get scared from this message and click boldly on OK. Now SHOW offers a screenmode requester, which allows to select the
16 or 24 bit screen you wish.
</P>
<P>
If this is done you can select one or more pictures to be displayed using a file requester.
</P>
<P>
If SHOW displayed the picture(s) it is recommended to save the most important program parameters, that are saved in
ENV:Show.prefs and put the error message on startup into history.
</P>
<P>
SHOW can also be started via Workbench as well as via the CLI. Without problems SHOW can be used from programs like
DOpus. In addition to just displaying the pictures the program offers a number of options for additional manipulation
of the displayed pictures. So you can scroll too large pictures with a good speed, in addition you can zoom in or out
in any intensity. In addition you can scale the picture by pressing a button to the half or the double size or put it back
to its original size. In addition to showing the pictures SHOW offers a rudimentary picture editing and offers these
functions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Negative mode
</LI>
<BR><LI> horizontal und vertical mirror
</LI>
<BR><LI> rotate 90°
</LI>
<BR><LI> gamma correction
</LI>
<BR><LI> RGB to gray scale
</LI>
<BR><LI> brightness and contrast correction
</LI>
<BR><LI> colour correction of the basic colours
</LI>
<BR><LI> cutting of picture parts
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Show.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Show.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="69" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Of course, the picture, that have been changed that way can be saved, which also allows the scrambling of the pictures
using the XPK package.
</P>
<P>
Another special feature is the possibility to composite various pictures to another picture. But the possibilities to be
creative are restricted in the mode.
</P>
<P>
If you'd like to show your picture collection as a slide show to an interested audience - this is no problem with SHOW.
With a quickly written script you can decide whether to run an endless loop or to run it once. In addition the program
author offers the program RANDOMFILES, which doesn't only work with SHOW, but with programs like CyberShow. RANDOMFILES
can be controlled via the CLI. It creates a script for SHOW from the picture collection. The included, slim documentation
is a good help for the user.
</P>
<H3>4. Conclusion</H3>
<P>
SHOW is more than just a CyberGraphX picture displayer, it can be used for small corrections of existing pictures.
But even if the program author insists on being no programmer the current revision of SHOW runs quite stable and
show a large number of functionality for a picture displayer.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the current revision of SHOW doesn't support datatypes. This restricts the universal usage to partly
hard limits.
</P>
<P>
In addition the creation of a script file for a SHOW slideshow is not very intuitive.
But:
SHOW is freeware and worth a look!
</P>
<P>
The current version (1.14) of SHOW can be found in the Aminet under
