<H2>5. What is true from the 'Transmeta' rumour?</H2>
<P>
During the last weeks there were rumours again, which claim that a new processor or the company Transmeta will be use
in the AmigaNG. Two things have to be mentioned in this matter:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> This rumour bases on an information, which is several months old.
</LI>
<BR><LI> According to Dr. Havemose they haven't decided for any chip, yet. With the 'MMC', that was mentioned on the
'World of Amiga 98' they just wanted to make clear, what power the AmigaNG has to offer.
<P>
  It has also to be considered, that AMIGA places on hardware independence.
</P>
<P>
  But there is another possibility: The use of the Transmeta chip should be kept a secret as long as possible.
  One point is, that it is to be said a completely new processor, apart from CISC and RISC technology, that can
  be put to state-of-the-art with software updates(!). Someone can also like this theory, so you have to ask yourself:
  &quot;If this chip really allows a gigantic speed, why shouldn't AMIGA be interested in using it within an
  'Amiga-native' hardware?
