<P>

After a couple of months break, Amiga Survivor Magazine returns with a
brand new issue. We are now settled in our new offices, and the newly
designed magazine finally makes a comeback with the best issue yet.

The new, full-color cover'd A4 magazine has just been released with pages
of the latest news, reviews and previews of all things Amiga.

We have a special 4-page EXCLUSIVE preview of Digital Images' forthcoming
conversion of WipEout 2097, including weapon and craft details and an
exclusive interview with the man behind the conversion; Stuart Walker.
There are full reviews of NetConnect v2, Kang-Fu, APC&TCP volumes 4 & 6.
Tons of previews including: The Prophet & Phoenix Fighters from Alive
Mediasoft, Wildtracks, Pinball Pro, Abduction, Diablos Land, MegaPolice,
The Last Seal, and updaates of Spcestation 3000, Hex, The Holy Trinity and
more!
Plus, we'll have the usual articles, such as The Fifth Column, The
Trashcan, Aminet Ramble, Web Watch and all that malarkey. We're also
introducing our new feature, a Retro page which looks back over the last 
few years of the Amiga's livelihood.
PLUS! We've also got (another) BRAND NEW LOOK courtesy of our cover artist;
Stephen Thwaites. You'll have to See it to Believe it!
