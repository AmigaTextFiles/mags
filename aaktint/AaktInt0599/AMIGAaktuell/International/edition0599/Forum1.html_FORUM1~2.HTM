<H2>1. Progress report about Eagle Computer (by Stefan Schindler)</H2>
<P>
</P>
&raquo;Regarding the theme EAGLE computer I can confirm the negative experiences.
</P>
<P>
My A4000 tower case was delivered with a delay of three months and only after some telephone calls, where the
excuses for the delay were contradictory. (It also happened, that an employee told me, he would call back within
an hour, but he didn't.)
</P>
<P>
The 250W power supply for the tower was promised to me for 60.00 DEM on the telephone, but appeared on the bill with
an additional 60.00 DEM. The holes on the back weren't made correctly, so that a slot outlet could not be reached. The
mounting screws for the motherboard weren't pre-mounted. Some important screws for the stands of the towers. My Cyberstorm
MKII didn't fit (resp. after sawing and filing), because a piece of metal was in the way. When I called them I learned,
that the problem was known. EAGLE should have told me BEFORE I ordered.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5&quot; cage didn't fit after mounting the processor board, especially with the much too short power cables. The
power supply wasn't connected to the On/Off switch and there wasn't a manual to tell me how to do it. So the connection
could only be made using a measuring instrument.
</P>
<P>
When I called the company and told them the problems, named above they told me: &quot;And what are we supposed to do?&quot;
When I explained, that I think EAGLE didn't keep the contract they promised to send me an Amiga mouse and various CDs in
the parcel (with the missing tower stands!). I'm still waiting for this parcel since February...
</P>
<P>
So, if I have to say it in short form: EAGLE bungles and if you order from EAGLE it's your own fault.
