And now a supplemental regarding the hiring of Dr. Rick LeFaivre:
Maybe it has been certain for weeks. Because the photo of Dr. LeFaivre, which can be downloaded from

looks very much like the one with the, until now, unknown AMIGA employee, who is on the left side of a several months old photo, which can be downloaded
from  <A HREF="http://www.amiga-magazin.de/magazin/a04-99/news/gruppe.jpg" TARGET="_TOP">http://www.amiga-magazin.de/magazin/a04-99/news/gruppe.jpg</A>.
