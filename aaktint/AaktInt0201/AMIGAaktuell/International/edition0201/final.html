<P>
I know, I know: This is what I have announced several times in the last few years only to
herald huge disappointment for Amiga users.
</P>
<P>
But now there is more hope than ever for a new Amiga: at CeBIT the first handheld device
based upon the new operating system will debut.
</P>
<P>
But what does this mean for a user who wants to purchase not more and not less than a
desktop computer? On first sight, just nothing, but on the second quite a lot: As soon as
the first AmigaDE products hit the market, be it handheld devices, set-top boxes or even
mobile phones, AMIGA gains revenues, read important resources, to give the finishing
touch to the without doubt more sumptuous versions of computer operating systems.
Furthermore high quality AmigaDE devices are the best advertisement for the generation of
Amiga computers to come - and new software developers from outside the Amiga area may be
attracted, even possibly several &quot;acquaintances&quot; who left our system years ago.
</P>
<P>
Currently it is up in the air when the first desktop version of the AmigaDE will be
released. According to Eyetech not before summer; AMIGA itself seems to believe an
earlier date possible, but does not want to commit to setting a date. But this should not
be a worry, it is better than the recent practice of ambitious schedules followed by
deeply disappointed Amiga users when the product is released much later or - as in most
cases - not at all.
</P>
<P>
Let us hope the AmigaDE is released as early as possible, but:
Rather a bit later and a mature version from the beginning than a buggy quick shot. The
latter could cripple AmigaDE's chances in one go or in the worst case even kill it off
completely.
