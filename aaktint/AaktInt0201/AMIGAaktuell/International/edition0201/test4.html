<H2>4. Software test: Multi preferences &raquo;MainPrefs&laquo; (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P><B>The Configuration center of the Amiga</B></P>
<P><B>MainPrefs by Martin Elsner</B></P>
<H3>1. Program description</H3>
<P>
Some days ago, a program announcement that promised to help all those &quot;system
administrators&quot;, appeared on the &quot;amiga-news.de&quot;-news ticker [1]. Martin Elsner described
his free program &quot;MainPrefs&quot; as a tool flow system configuration. It includes functions
to manage assigns and environment variables, to edit configuration files and to use
preferences editors from one central point.
</P>
<P>
That sounds interesting, and so we will take a closer look at MainPrefs in the current
version 2.05.
</P>
<H3>2. System requirements</H3>
<P>
The author says nothing about hardware requirements, so &quot;MainPrefs&quot; should work with all
systems. So it is even more astounding that the minimum software requirement is Amiga OS
3.5. The reason is simple: MainPrefs uses the ReAction-GUI that was introduced with OS
3.5.
</P>
<H3>3. Installation</H3>
<P>
You have two options: either you use the included install script after downloading [3]
and unpacking the archive, or you just copy the whole directory anywhere on your system.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs3.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="95" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
If you want to get rid of the program again, you only need to delete the directory.
</P>
<H3>4. Program usage</H3>
<P>
The included documentation is short and succinct, but understandable and includes
everything you need to know to use this program. The author explicitly warns you about
the risks of careless experimenting with environmental variables and the
&quot;startup-sequence&quot; - not without reason. You should know what you are doing before
editing these files.
</P>
<P>
MainPrefs can be started from Shell as well from the Workbench.
</P>
<P>
The main window shows four tabs for the four types of files you can modify: &quot;Assigns&quot;,
&quot;Files&quot;, &quot;Programs&quot; and &quot;Variables&quot;.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs4.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs4.jpg" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Furthermore, you can define the standard editor, save changed preferences and load the
help file. The latter function did not work initially. SnoopDos quickly showed why:
MainPrefs looks for Multiview either in C: or its own directory. But neither is the case
on the standard installation. Usually, Multiview resides in the &quot;Utilities&quot; drawer. If
you copy the program to one of the aforementioned directories, the help file appears upon
pressing the &quot;Help&quot; key.
</P>
<H4>4.1 Assigns</H4>
<P>
The tab &quot;Assigns&quot; lists all logical devices that are currently assigned. You can scroll
around in this list, and modify, add and delete assigns. If an older assign already
exists, you can choose either to add the new assign or to overwrite the old. You can also
choose if you want to attach the assign to a path name, so that with removable media the
assign is carried over to the new medium; or to use the option &quot;DEFER&quot; to activate the
assign only if the &quot;device&quot; is accessed. Note that the newly defined or modified assigns
are only temporary. If you want them to survive a reboot, you must save them permanently,
for example in the &quot;user-startup&quot;.
</P>
<H4>4.2 Files</H4>
<P>
And this brings us to the next tab: Martin Elsner already has included the two central
configuration files, &quot;startup-sequence&quot; and &quot;user-startup&quot;, into the &quot;Files&quot; lists. You
can easily add further files. After double-clicking one of those listed files, the
standard editor you have configured before starts up with this file and you can start
editing.
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. But if you try to remove all of the files from the list, MainPrefs will
punish you with a crash (reproducible) that brings down the whole system.
</P>
<H4>4.3 Programs</H4>
<P>
A little scared, we moved on to the &quot;Programs&quot; tab. By default, you find here some
programs from the &quot;Prefs&quot; drawer. Similar to &quot;Files&quot;, you can add files (not only from
inside &quot;Prefs&quot;), give them an informative name and start them by double-clicking.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs5.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs5.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="83" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this tab suffers from the same deadly bug described in &quot;Files&quot;.
</P>
<H4>4.4 Variables</H4>
<P>
Many programs put global variables into &quot;ENV-Archive&quot;, which then can be found in the
&quot;Env&quot; directory on the RAM disk during a session. You can also maintain these with
MainPrefs.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs6.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs6.jpg" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
That displays the variables themselves as well as their contents. If a subdirectory
exists, you can go down it with a mouse click. Of course, you can go up again
(UNIX-like).
</P>
<P>
A button loads the variables from the directory &quot;Env-archive&quot;, which is located inside
&quot;Prefs&quot;. Not all variables can be edited, even if they are displayed by MainPrefs.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs7.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs7.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="66" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
You should be especially careful here. You can accept the changes you've made either
temporarily for the actual session by pressing &quot;Use&quot; or store them permanently with
&quot;Save&quot;.
</P>
<H3>5. Result</H3>
<P>
MainPrefs is an interesting concept. The program offers a central point for configuration
and manipulation of the most important system and program parameters. The program
philosophy is well thought out and makes intuitive handling possible.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, MainPrefs requires the ReAction-GUI, which means that users of Amiga OS
versions prior to 3.5 are unable to use this helpful program. A pity.
A few bugs dull the positive impression. The &quot;repairable&quot; help function may be
acceptable, system crashes during the usage of the program are clearly not. As soon as
Martin Elsner fixes these problems, MainPrefs is a fine and recommendable piece of Amiga
software.
