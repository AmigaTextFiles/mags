<H2>3. Geography software test &raquo;Geoworld 1.12&laquo; (by Dietmar Bertelsbeck)</H2>
<P>
Tested on:<BR>
A3000T<BR>
2MB chip-RAM, 92 MB fast-RAM<BR>
Kickstart 40.68, Workbench 45.1/OS 3.9<BR>
Cyberstorm MK68060<BR>
PicassoIV<BR>
</P>
<H3>1. Installation</H3>
<P>
Installation could be a problem. The package is provided via three emails, each with one
DMS file. Unfortunately, there are no instructions on what to do with these files. For
those of you who have never worked with DMS-files before, a short guide:
Obviously you need the DMS program. a) start DMS with option &quot;write&quot; and name (complete
path) of DMS-file, for example &quot;DMS write Work:Geoworld1.DMS&quot; b) insert disc in df0: and
confirm c) repeat this with the other files (each with another disc).
After that, Geoworld can be installed from these discs via installer.
</P>
<H3>2. Screenmode</H3>
<P>
After starting Geoworld, a requester pops up for choosing screen mode. Tip: don't use
24-bit modes, because in this mode the message appears: &quot;Landkarte leider noch nicht
verf&uuml;gbar.&quot; (engl. map is not available), followed by a screenmode with 32 colours.
At 1024x760 the screen doesn't fit completely, so use 800x600 with 256 Colours. Even if a
24-bit mode is selected, only 8-bit will be displayed. That should be sufficient.
</P>

<H3>3. Navigation</H3>
<P>
Hard to go wrong. You simply have to click on a country on the worldmap and a map of that
country will appear with plentiful text information. There are about 220 countries
available as yet.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld2.jpg" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
If you enter the name of a specific country in the controlwindow (wildcards are
supported), the country will be shown directly, or a requester with all possible
countries will pop up. Alternatively you can click on a country on the worldmap. The
country will fill blue, and the information be displayed in the info window.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld3.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="88" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Geoworld offers answers to the following questions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> What country is it ? (click on worldmap)
</LI>
<BR><LI> Where is the country ? (search via name)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Very interesting also is &quot;maxi-search&quot;. This feature allows searching for a country or
town - sorted by size, inhabitants, postal code, etc. Try it, it's fun ! By the way:
searching by phonenumber would be great.
</P>

<H3>4. Infos</H3>
<P>
a. Country selection (&quot;L&auml;nderauswahl&quot;)
</P>
<P>
A requester with all 220 countries appears. Unfortunately it is not possible to change
its size. In the menu you can select a sorting method (region, inhabitants, etc.). What
is the smallest city ? (Vatican City). Unfortunately there is no sorting method
&quot;up-wise&quot;.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld5.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld5.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="78" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
In the info-window for countries, there is a cycle-button called &quot;general&quot; (&quot;allgemein&quot;).
A click on this button lets you browse through all provided information. There are some
errors, which apparently are caused by using MagicX with Cycle-to-menu-function
activated. Sometimes the description in the gadget disappears.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld6.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld6.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="89" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
b. City-selection
</P>
<P>
This is another unchangeable requester listing 6119 cities, including 1889 in Germany.
You can reduce the number of listed towns by entering a search key and sorting by
different criteria, e.g. date of founding.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld7.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld7.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="74" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
c. Both
</P>
<P>
This menu is available if the map-window is activated. On my system the menu-description
of the chosen menu is hardly readable (turquoise). MagicMenu could be the reason for
that. For both requesters I miss a function to position them and/or a limitation in the
city-requester, when being called from country-info (USA has 1178 cities !).
</P>
<P>
d. Currency-calculator
</P>
<P>
The currency-calculator is very nice. You can calculate rates between any currencies. The
number of currencies in the world is amazing. An update-function for currency-prices
would be great (euro).
</P>
<H3>5. Sundries</H3>
<P>
Unfortunately, the map-windows are not positionable. A click on windowborders of the
world-map leads to the message &quot;Landkarte noch nicht verf&uuml;gbar&quot; (map is not available).
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Geoworld8.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Geoworld8.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="27" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Choosing (in preferences) a blinking arrow over the selected country on worldmap doesn't
work on my system. Sometimes the arrow appears, but over the wrong country. On the other
hand, it works with cities. The description of cities is mostly difficult to read or
impossible (cities very near together or text written over the city).
</P>
<H3>6. Summing up</H3>
<P>
If this review has given the impression Geoworld is no good, nothing could be further
from the truth.
</P>
<P>
I love GeoWorld, because it provides very easy access to extensive information about 220
countries. I don't think there is one country missing... Looking at the list of
international associations for example, you will find many things you never knew before.
Certainly, a lot of time has been spent collecting all this information - Great! And
there are regular updates available.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing missing in the functionality of Geoworld, but the claim of being a full
geography-program can't be accepted. Missing is information about rivers, seas,
mountains, countries and counties, etc. GeoWorld shines in information about countries
and cities/towns. Additionally you get a program for searching postal codes. In terms of
price-performance, I classify it as &quot;very good&quot;.
</P>
<H3>7. Recommendation</H3>
<P>
For those who are interested in countries and cities/towns, or those who want a fast
comfortable search engine for information about these topics, Geoworld is highly
recommended. In these areas, it beats any atlas.
</P>
<P>
Geoworld is available for DEM 24.90 (appr. EUR 13). More informations can be found on
