<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>Breast or drumstick.......?</B></P>
<P>
And again I must note: This world is evil. The audience of a Munich radio station was
able to experience live a spectacular happening. In the interests of general wellbeing a
new kind of sport was needed. So &quot;Extreme-Microwaving&quot; was invented. Sporting, sporting
.... but, confound it, how does it work?
</P>
<P>
Take a little child, or better, the toy car of a little child.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore take the sister of that rugrat, who has long suffered the merry-mad-driving
sound of exactly that toy car.
</P>
<P>
The poor sister, whom we all sympathize with, now had this satanic plan to &quot;fry&quot; the toy
car in the microwave oven. But all Munich was to learn about this blow for freedom, and
thus all of this went &quot;on air&quot;.
</P>
<P>
In all its gory detail the sister related how the nerve-jangling
monster metamorphosed into a little shrunken plastic puddle of bleeding colours. At the
end of this rite she shared the relief of every toy terrorist when she confirmed that no
battery could be connected to that plastic puddle to produce that kind of sound  again
(to talk about music would have been exaggeration).
</P>
<P>
&quot;Oh well,&quot; says the reader, &quot;a bit less electronics on this planet.
But where is the kick?&quot;
</P>
<P>
Well, cynic that I am, I would have let the kid participate in ceremony. The loud crying
of the child at the resolute activity of the sister certainly could have been emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Before complaints by the German Children's Protection Association pelt down on me
serially, I'll try to dare an elegant twist to the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems of recent electronics definitely is the poor protection
against noise. Blowers and drives, motors and alarms every day assault our ears. In a
capital like Munich this inevitably has an effect upon the psyche. Who hasn't secretly
wanted to chuck his neighbour or the computer into the microwave?!
</P>
<P>
A request to Snoqualmie: Let us hope we will be saved from similar situations at least
with our &quot;girlfriend&quot;. I really would not like to ....
</P>
<P><B>Live long and prosperous,</B></P>
<P>
yours

P.S.: Of course the gag with the microwave is not advised for imitation.
Where else should we let the Ravioli take the sunbath?
