<H2>3. Interview with AMIGAs president Bill McEwen (by Christoph Dietz)</H2>
<P>
The following interview with AMIGAs president Bill McEwen has been published by our
partners amiga-news.de:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;<B>Amiga-News: In your latest Executive Update you announce that the CES
(Consumer Electronics Show) would be a great fun for the Amiga community.
But how would this be a great fun if Amiga Inc. is not a exhibitor there?</B>
</P>
<P>
Bill McEwen: We were there. We had two companies showing Amiga enabled
devices at the show. These meetings were private, but we were there :-)
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Can you tell us details about this devices and the companies behind?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: No. We are under NDA with each of them. Announcements will follow soon.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: In an interview with Corinna Cohn you told the community that Amiga Inc.
is low on money and our readers are now wondering if this means that Amiga
Inc. is closing down. So why are you low on money?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: We are far from closing down. It takes money to run this business, and
we planned to raise money in summer of last year. Our timing was off, and
the market had a big downturn. As of the time of the discussion we had not
secured more funding.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: So I can assume that there is no financial shortness anymore?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: We will continue to watch every dime very carefully, this is not a
market to be crazy with your money.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Can you tell us the names of Amiga Inc.'s investors?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: The &quot;Invisible Hand Corporation, LLC&quot;, and &quot;Net Ventures, BV&quot;.
</P>
<P><B>AN: What do these investors expect from Amiga?</B></P>
<P>
BME: To make money.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: They are not interested in the Amiga products to use in their own
products?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: They are investors not OEM's.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Is going public an option for Amiga Inc.? Can we expect to buy stock
options in the near future?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Public offering is not possible at this time. But you can expect to
have opportunities to invest in the future with Amiga.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Francis Charig told me (as published on amiga-news.de) that the AmigaDE
will be ready in the first half of this year. Are you agreeing with this?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Yes. This is the plan.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: How and then (more exact) will AmigaDE hit the marked?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Initially in some OEM hardware platforms, and then it will get more
functionality and be out in other hardware with software following.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: According to MeterNet they are only waiting for AmigaDE to release their
Set-Top box. When do they get AmigaDE and will this version be the same as
planned for release in the OEM hardware?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Yes, the initial release is for this type of hardware OEM.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Also Francis spoke about memory protection and why TAO is not planning
to implement MP into the operating system. But you already announced that
Amiga Inc. is going to implement MP into AmigaDE. Is this plan up to date?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Tao is not, and they never were going to. This is consistent to what we
have said since the beginning. Amiga is handling the MP. So the plan is the
same that we have said since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Can we expect MP to be in the first versions of AmigaDE?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: No, not in the first version. It has been planned for later.
</P>
<P><B>AN: Why do you think MP is needed?</B></P>
<P>
BME: I personally think that this is better suited for the desktop and
server market.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: What can AmigaDE developers expect to be added into the next SDK update?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Sound, 3d, and numerous other new tools and enhancements.
</P>
<P><B>AN: When can they expect the next update?</B></P>
<P>
BME: Targeted for end of February - middle of March.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: More than 15.000 copies of SDK are sold. How many developers are
registered? And how many of them are contributing software?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: A little over 2,000 busy working.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: This means that at least 13.000 people only bought the SDK to support
Amiga Inc. with some money or for to add the SDK to their treasury?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: You asked how many are registered. We have thousands who are working
and have not registered.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Do you know a reason why they didn't register?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: No. It is really up to them. We have also located two sites that have
created SDK's that are pirated. I believe that we have shut them down now,
but we know that several copies were downloaded before we stopped them.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Which is the most amazing software contributed right now?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: There are so many, I do not know where to begin. I would encourage
people to look at the developer section of the web site to see many of the
titles that are being worked on.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: While the &quot;World of Amiga 2000&quot; in Cologne Fleecy announced that about
1.5 Mio units of AmigaDE are already sold. What is the market and when
will the AmigaDE based products show up?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Products will begin showing up in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: A press release from &quot;Thendic Electronic Components&quot; just crossed the
wire that tells that &quot;in September 2001 Thendric will release a modified
Handheld-PC for the consumer market under the label 'Amiga(TM)'.&quot; Are they
only licensing the Name &quot;Amiga&quot;? Or will they use AmigaDE?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: There is only ONE owner of the Amiga name and Trademarks, Amiga Inc. We
own the worldwide exclusive rights to all of the Amiga properties, that
were once in the hands of Gateway. Thenric has licensed AmigaDE for their
devices. We were not supposed to say anything for another month, but since
they have announced, then it is true they are one of many new licensors of
AmigaDE.
</P>
<P><B>AN: And are there other products?</B></P>
<P>
BME: Several in the works and all over the office.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: How many copies of AmigaOS3.9 are sold? How close are we to an
PPC-Version of AmigaOS 4.0?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: OS 3.9 I do not know right now. We had several thousand out by before
Christmas, and I have not seen the reports of the sales since that time.
We should have some numbers up on the site soon. As far as meeting the
sales requirements for the OS 4.0 PPC version, we are not even close. We
are still evaluating the market need for this product, and I hope that we
can show that there is a true market and business for 4.0, and even other
versions in the future.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: When can we expect that the decision is made?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Working on it now.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: What are the improvements in the classic AmigaOS to legitimate the
version jump to 4.x?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: Once the decision has been made, then you will see a targeted feature
list and then we will all know.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Do you know about the status of development at Eyetech and bPlan?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: I have been focused on other funding issues, and Fleecy has been
working more closely with these developments.
</P>
<P><B>AN: Will the AmigaOne be available in Q3/2001?</B></P>
<P>
BME: That is the plan.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: How can the Amiga community support Amiga Inc. at best?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: The best way to directly help is the purchase of SDK's and other
products. And the more people creating product for Amiga the better. We
have recently received several new games for AmigaDE and they are great.
It is really encouraging to see all of the development efforts underway,
and the more people that we have developing the better.
</P>
<P>
<B>AN: Are these games only converted from other platforms or are they
completely new? Are they cutting edge in graphics, sound and idea?</B>
</P>
<P>
BME: All of the above.
</P>
<P><B>AN: Bill, thank you for this interview!</B></P>
