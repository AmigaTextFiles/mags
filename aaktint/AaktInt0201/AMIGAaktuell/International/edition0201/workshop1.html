<H2>1. Workshop: You &raquo;wood&laquo; if you could - Creating Textures for WBClock (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
   [Translator's remark: The program Cinema4D used for the workshop from the AmigaPlus CD
is a German version and has no English localization. Therefore menu items, requester text
etc. will be quoted in German with an additional translation. Christian, the author,
helped me with several menu items, but even he (at short notice) could only find an
incomplete English version of the program.]
</P>
<P>
Knock on wood (or: &quot;How to create a nice texture for my WBClock under OS3.9&quot;)
</P>
<P>
Yes, I admit, in the beginning I was not a believer in AmigaOS 3.9. In more than one
eMail list I had read a lot about problems of installation and use. But then again I
heard quite a lot of good things about it. Totally confused, I ordered it from KDH. :)
</P>
<P>
Here I wish to repeat a fervent &quot;Thank you!&quot; to KDH. They had the parcel in my hands
within 24 hours - and this was in the holidays!! But then again if it hadn't been
Christmas I wouldn't have been there to pay the COD at my front door. ;)
</P>
<P>
So much for delivery. Since then I have become completely sold on the performance and the
convenience of the 3.9 update. The graphical appearance, the improvements to the
preference programs, the CD player, Action, AMPlifier etc. and of course Genesis V1.0.6
in full version justify the price of 89.- DM (45.50 Euro).
</P>
<P>
Only the WBClock disappointed me a little. And no, not the WBClock itself, but the
textures that come with it.
</P>
<P>
Not that they look crap, but the textures just are too big for my
Workbench, and there are too few of them. The look is not improved by scaling them back.
</P>
<P>
The more I played with it, the more I came to realise I would not  be happy without a
nice circular clock in a border of virtual wood. My first impulse was to whinge about the
lack thereof, but being versed in Amiga graphics programs, I thought it would be quicker
to create my own. I think it looks good and at 99x99 pixels does not use up too much ram
on a Workbench.
</P>
<P>
Because I hoped ;) that my wood would inspire others to create their own looks, I decided
to write a little workshop. You don't need much, just a few graphics programs which most
serious Amiga users already have on the hard drive.
</P>
<P>
My wood texture was turned in the raytracer Cinema4D. I wanted to enhance my Workbench,
not make it look amateurish, and any old idler can slap on some borrowed backdrop. ;)
</P>
<P>
I used version 4.0 Pro from the legendary AmigaPlus CDROM. It should be possible to
emulate this workshop with older versions without problems. If you do not have Cinema4D,
you could use some other raytracer (Imagine, Moonzoom or Tornado should work as well). If
short of funds and software, you should have a look at the software offers on  AC Forum
(www.amiga-club.de) or at eBay (www.ebay.de, or your local variant). I've often seen
there very inexpensive Cinema4D offers. As far as I know, the publisher Falke-Verlag some
time ago had several AmigaPlus CDROMs with Cinema4D. You could ask there, too.
</P>
<P>
Once you've got a raytracer, make sure you have the paint program PPaint as well.
Preferably version 7, which can be downloaded for free from the Aminet.
</P>
<P>
For touching up graphic errors, changing the size of the picture and adjusting the
brightness I used ArtEffect. ArtEffect is not really necessary for this workshop, but if
you have it, you can experiment with its many effects. Alternatively, you can use any
24Bit picture processor you are comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
Fire up Cinema. For a round clock with a nice wooden border just three objects are
needed: one ring, one disk and a source of light. We will start with the ring.
</P>
<P>
Select the menu &quot;Objekte/Grundobjekte/Ring&quot; [Object/Base Object/Ring] and keep the
&quot;Shift&quot; key pressed. The following requester should pop up.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/WBClock1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WBClock1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="91" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The number of the &quot;Ringsegmente&quot; [Ring Segments] should be increased to 36. Do this to
make the curvature of the clock smoother. The &quot;Rohrradius&quot; [Pipe Radius] is set to 25 to
make the ring narrower. The remaining settings must not be changed (&quot;Ringradius&quot; [Radius
of Ring]=200, &quot;Rohrsegmente&quot; [Pipe Segments]=12). Now click on &quot;OK&quot; and Cinema creates
the ring.
</P>
<P>
Next we need the clock's background, or rather the surface where the clockface will be
displayed later. For this we use a simple disk.
</P>
<P>
Return to the menu &quot;Objekte/Grundobjekte&quot; [Object/Base Object] and  select with pressed
&quot;Shift&quot; key the item &quot;Scheibe&quot; [Disk]. In the requester set the &quot;Radius&quot; [Radius] to 175.
The number of &quot;Segmente&quot; [Segments] should be 36, the same as for the ring.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to bring the objects into their correct positions. Activate the &quot;XY&quot;
view in the toolbox and select the &quot;Ring&quot; object. This is done by opening the menu
&quot;Bearbeiten&quot; [Edit] and activating the item &quot;Objekt ausw&auml;hlen...&quot; [Object Selection...].
In the requester select the entry &quot;Ring&quot; and click on &quot;OK&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Then the ring is &quot;stood up&quot;. Select in the toolbox &quot;Objekt bearbeiten&quot; [Edit Object] (the
cube below the eye) and &quot;Drehen&quot; [Turn] (the bent arrow). Because we want to turn the
clock around the x-axis, &quot;X&quot; must be activated in the toolbox, too. If you have done all
this, you may &quot;stand up&quot; the ring through 90 degrees. When the ring has turned far
enough, the lines of the wire-frame cube appearing during the rotation should align with
those of the Y-plane. Or in other words: When during rotation of the object inside of the
XY-view, if only a (2D-)square is visible, the ring is in the correct position.
</P>
<P>
After placing the ring in the upright position, we turn to the background of the clock's
dial. Cinema offers for this a useful &quot;Ausrichten&quot; [Align] function. First the disk
object must be selected. For this the previously used function &quot;Objekt ausw&auml;hlen...&quot;
[Object Selection...] is activated again. After selecting &quot;Scheibe&quot; [Disk] you enter the
menu &quot;Extra/Ausrichten auf...&quot; [Extra/Align to...]. In the requester select the entry
&quot;Ring&quot; [Ring] and click to &quot;OK&quot;. As you see, the disk is placed to the correct position.
</P>
<P>
The worst is now over, but we still need a source of light.
</P>
<P>
Again enter the menu &quot;Objekte/Grundobjekte&quot; [Object/Base Object] and there activate the
item &quot;Lichtquelle&quot; [Light Source] - but this time without pressing the &quot;Shift&quot; key,
because the standard settings are sufficient for our purpose. You should activate the
&quot;XZ&quot; view, which lets you view the scene from above. Next the &quot;Verschiebe&quot; [Shift] mode
in the toolbox is activated (this is the arrow showing to the right).
</P>
<P>
The light source should be set close to the front of the clock. Use the dotted
positioning squares which Cinema draws into the page view. A good position for the light
is 1 square in front (on the Z-axis - &quot;Z&quot; selected, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; deselected) and appr. 1
square to the left (X-axis - &quot;X&quot; selected, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; deselected), but you might enjoy
experimenting for effect.
</P>
<P>
Now move the light in the up direction: switch to the XY-view and push the source of
light a little more than one square up (Y-axis - &quot;Y&quot; selected, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; deselected).
The XY-view will look like this:
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/WBClock2.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WBClock2.jpg" WIDTH="96" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
You might be tempted to lock in the illumination at this stage, but don't. After you have
created your surface textures, they may  look better if you alter the position of the
light source slightly.
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that the lighting of the clock should correspond to the lighting of the
Workbench. If you look at the 3D effects used on Workbench you will see that light always
comes from the upper left - the upper left part of icons, windows and buttons is brighter
than the lower right part. The lighting of the clock should be similar.
</P>
<P>
ok! Our clock still looks a bit pale -  we need a surface texture. My preference was a
border of wood. For this I activated the material manager of Cinema (right Amiga + &quot;m&quot; or
the menu &quot;Fenster/Materialmanager&quot; [Window/Material Manager]. An empty window opens.
Click and hold down the right mouse button and select in the pop-up menu the item &quot;Neu&quot;
[New].
</P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Activate the texture &quot;Neu&quot; [New]&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">and again hold down the right button. In the pop-up&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">menu select the item &quot;Bearbeiten&quot;&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN="TOP">[Edit]. The texture editor appears.&nbsp;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
First the &quot;Farbe&quot; [Color] of the material is edited. There are two areas, one to edit the
color of the material and the other one to define the texture.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/WBClock3.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WBClock3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="78" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The first three sliders in the area &quot;Farbe&quot; [Color] should all be at 100 percent. The
fourth slider adjusts the intensity of the color. Set this slider to appr. 14 percent. In
the area &quot;Textur&quot; [Texture] the texture of the surface can be selected. With Cinema4D
several textures are supplied. In the file requester select the mahogany texture, which
you will find in &quot;C4D:Tex/mahagoni.tif&quot;. Ignore the cycle gadget &quot;Interpol&quot;. The texture
doesn't look bad......
</P>
<P>
...........but I'd like it polished! ;) So let's make the texture shine a little. At the
right border of the window &quot;Material bearbeiten&quot; [Edit Material] there are several
buttons with a checkmark (or without...). Only &quot;Farbe&quot; [Color] and &quot;Schatten&quot; [Shadow]
are selected. Activate the checkmark for &quot;Glanz&quot; [Shine]. Next click upon &quot;Glanz&quot; [Shine]
in one of the top rows. Set &quot;Modus&quot; [Mode] to &quot;Plastik&quot; [Plastics]. Set the slider
&quot;Breite&quot; [Width] to 12 percent, and the slider &quot;H&ouml;he&quot; [Height] to 27 percent. You could
use different values, but don't overdo it with the &quot;Glanz&quot; [Shine]...the border of the
clock shouldn't look like a cheap mahogany-veneer-imitation made of plastics. ;) Now
click &quot;OK&quot;.
</P>
<P>
In the window of the material manager the new texture should be displayed. Now we have to
assign the texture to the border of the clock (object name &quot;Ring&quot;). For this the ring has
to be selected as I explained earlier. After you have selected the ring, again click with
the right mouse button upon the wood texture in the material manager and select the item
&quot;Zuweisen&quot; [Assign] in the pop-up menu.
</P>
<P>
The next thing we need is a nice surface for the dial. I felt a background with a dull
polish made from a grayish material would go well with mahogany. Create a new texture for
this, following the procedure used for the mahogany texture. In the settings for &quot;Farbe&quot;
[Color] the first three sliders again should be set to 100 percent. Try the fourth
intensity slider at 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
This time we will not use a texture. The clockface should have a dull gleam. For this we
we again set the checkmark &quot;Glanz&quot; [Shine] at the right border. In the settings &quot;Glanz&quot; I
used the mode &quot;Plastik&quot; [Plastics], and set &quot;Breite&quot; [Width] to 18 percent and &quot;H&ouml;he&quot;
[Height] to 28 percent. Confirm with &quot;OK&quot; and assign the texture to the dial (object name
is &quot;Scheibe&quot; [Disk]).
</P>
<P>
If you want you can make a test render at this stage. Prepare to be underwhelmed, because
the camera position is less than edifying. You have to set the scene for your
&quot;Photoshooting&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Change into &quot;Perspektive&quot; [Perspective] view by clicking on the &quot;P&quot; in the toolbox.
&quot;Perspektive&quot; shows the view from which the scene later will be rendered. You want to see
the clock from the front and not twisted sideways. (WBClock might not be pleased either.)
Turn the whole scene (the &quot;Eye&quot; in the toolbox must be selected) in the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;
directions so that the clock looks - so to speak - directly into the camera. This is
easiest done by turning the scene around one axis at a time.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/WBClock4.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WBClock4.jpg" WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
A test render now looks much more convincing, but not yet perfect because the environment
color is not set properly. Select in the &quot;Objekte&quot; [Object] menu the item &quot;Umgebung...&quot;
[Environment]. The requester allows the environment color to be adjusted. All three
sliders should be set to 50 percent. Click on &quot;OK&quot; and you are ready to render the scene.
</P>
<P>
To do this click on the &quot;Render&quot; symbol in the toolbox of Cinema (this is the symbol with
the film strip) and in the pop-up menu select the relevant render mode. If you want to
change the render parameters, click with the right mouse button on the symbol. In the
requester the size of the picture, the aspect ratio and several other self explanatory
parameters can be configured.
</P>
<P>
If the clock renders too big or too small (e.g. the borders of the clock are partly cut
off), adjust the scaling. The &quot;Eye&quot; and the &quot;Scaling&quot; (small triangle + big triangle)
symbols must be selected and the whole scene changed accordingly in the &quot;P&quot; view.
</P>
<P>
The final size of the WBClock texture should be predefined with Cinema. It depends on the
size of clock you want: if small,  don't render the graphics too big, because later
scalings with help of ArtEffect and PPaint will cost you quality.
</P>
<P>
It is best if the graphics are created in the preferred size of the final WBClock
texture. For this the picture format of a small  clock e.g. 99x99 pixels (don't wonder
about this &quot;99&quot; value, it will be explained later) will be set to appr. 103x103 pixels
and the scene scaled and shifted so that the border of the clock is just visible without
clipping the edges. The rendered picture should look like this:
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/WBClock5.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WBClock5.jpg" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The background is still too dark, but this does not matter. With PPaint the black borders
will later be cut off anyhow. If you believe your clock is a success, save the picture
and the scene. If the picture is too bright or too dark or not of the right size, just
change it within a 24Bit picture processor of your choice. PPaint should NOT be used for
this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Now start PPaint. First set the &quot;Color Reduction&quot; in menu &quot;Settings&quot; to &quot;Qualitative&quot; and
&quot;Dithering&quot; in the same menu to &quot;Floyd Steinberg&quot; and &quot;Best Quality&quot;. The screen needs to
have 256 colors. Now load the rendered graphic as a brush (press F5). After PPaint has
finished loading and &quot;downward calculations&quot;, the palette of the brush should be used as
screen palette. (Select menu &quot;Color/Palette/From Brush&quot; or simply press &quot;LAlt&quot; + &quot;b&quot;.)
</P>
<P>
Lay down the brush in the middle of the screen. In menu &quot;Settings/Transparency&quot; the item
&quot;Color&quot; must be selected. Cut out the graphic again and remove all unused areas of the
brush with &quot;LAlt&quot; + &quot;e&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Now press &quot;LAlt&quot; + &quot;i&quot;. This gives you a screen with the specifications of the brush.
IMPORTANT! The graphic must have uneven numbers of Pixels in the height and in the width,
so that WBClock can center the clockface. That means a size of 99x99 pixels or of 101x101
pixels is ideal. (All right, this was the explanation of the &quot;99&quot;-pixel-value. ;))
If this is not the case, try to change the height and the width by just one pixel. PPaint
offers a way to do this via an ARexx script called &quot;Brush Format&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Now again save the brush in IFF format and start WBClock. If you double click on the
clock you access its preferences. Under the tab &quot;Hands&quot; you set the &quot;Type of hands&quot; to
&quot;Rhombus&quot; and the &quot;Width of hands&quot; to &quot;Thin&quot;. Under tab &quot;Face&quot; you set the &quot;Background&quot;
to &quot;Transparent Picture&quot;. At &quot;Picture Name&quot; you select your saved texture.
</P>
<P>
Checkmarks must be set at &quot;Oval&quot; and &quot;Auto Size&quot;. Change the &quot;Radius (%)&quot; to 90 percent.
Under tab &quot;Colors&quot; the colors and borders of the pointers can be defined. In my opinion
the minute hand looks best in red with black border and the hour hand in white, also with
black border.
</P>
