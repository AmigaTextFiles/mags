<H2>5. Software test: System monitor &raquo;SnoopDOS v3.4&laquo; (by Klaus Moddemann)</H2>
<P>
Just in case you hadn't noticed, SnoopDOS34.lha is begging to be downloaded from Aminet.
It offers quite a few extra features over those in version 1.7. The most important are:
</P>
<P>
-Support for more than 20 new system functions
-Easy usage for all functions through a complete GUI
-Custom formats for the output file, including a format editor
-History function with scrolling
-Outputs of ARexx scripts can be displayed
-Commodity support
-Support for Cut&amp;Paste with Clipboard
-AmigaGuide-help for all functions
</P>
<P>
Once you have downloaded the archive, installation is as simple as unpacking it and
copying the contents somewhere on your hard disk. The program is started with the usual
double-click on the icon, which opens the SnoopDOS main window. The title bar is
resplendent with vital information like program name, author, version and hotkey.
Underneath is the event window that displays all system functions as they execute. Below
is the status bar, showing the current status of SnoopDOS. There are also some control
buttons.

<P>
A click on &quot;Setup&quot; opens the preferences window. Here you can change the font, the
default screen, logfile, hotkey and buffer for the display. In two string gadgets you can
define the format for both the output window and the log file. If a manual edit seems too
much, you can use the supplied SD-format editor. Open by clicking on &quot;Edit&quot; beside the
string gadget. SD-format lets you change all options with Drag'n'Drop.
</P>

<P>
When you're finished, confirm the changes with &quot;USE&quot; to get back to the preferences
window. With &quot;Copy&quot;, you can transfer the settings to the other string gadget. Confirm
with &quot;USE&quot; and you will be back in the main window.
</P>
<P>
With the &quot;Functions&quot; gadget, you can open a window to define the functions to be
monitored. Once again, make your settings, confirm them with &quot;USE&quot; and then if you are
happy with them use &quot;Save settings&quot; from the main window to save them permanently.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/SnoopDOS3.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/SnoopDOS3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="57" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The other gadgets are quite self explanatory.
</P>
<P>
Using SnoopDOS is very easy. Start it and then start the program(s) that are causing
problems. SnoopDOS gives very extensive information on the processes started by
recalcitrant program(s). You can save this information into a logfile.
</P>
<P>
SnoopDOS is not only helpful for trouble-shooting, but also for deinstallation, because
it shows which files are opened by a particular program.
</P>
<P>
To conclude this test: SnoopDOS is an easy-to-use program that helps you solve problems
without making problems itself. The only exception I noticed was MiamiInit: With SnoopDOS
running in the background, the whole system hangs when you start MiamiInit, making a
reboot necessary.
