<H2>2. AMIGA is looking for developers for PDA applications</H2>
<P>
The following mail from Gary Peake has been published by our partners amiga-news.de:
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;Hello,</B></P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, I promised you some exciting announcements. As the first of those, I
would like to introduce
Matt Fontenot, Amiga's Product Manager.
</P>
<P>
Matt has been with us from the beginning and while you may not have met him yet, he has
been working closely with
many of our third party partners and has been busy creating many new products, as you
will soon see.
</P>
<P><B>Now for the announcement:</B></P>
<P>
There is tremendous potential for distribution of your applications, games and other
content for one of the world's
largest manufacturers of PDA hardware. The projection is for more than 7 million units to
be sold by the end of
2001 and there are already several million units on the market at this time. There will
be specific requirements as far
as style, type of applications, distribution rights and certification of content. Matt
will have more details on this in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in developing PDA applications and games for a specific
manufacturer who will use Amiga Inc.
</P>
<P>
for content delivery, please contact Matt as soon as possible. This is a serious project
for those with an interest in
providing content and we will open a new mailing list for it - the particulars will be
announced in a few days.
</P>
<P>
This project is for both open source and commercial content providers, so no matter what
your choice of
development is, you are cordially invited to apply. To get further details, though, you
must have a signed NDA on
file with Amiga. You can get an NDA form from www.amigadev.net under the legal menu,
right hand menu bar.
</P>
<P>
Just fill it out and fax it to my attention at 425-396-5671. Then send an e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:projects@amiga.com">projects@amiga.com</A> that says
&quot;I am interested.&quot; You can also contact Gary at <A HREF="mailto:gary@amiga.com">gary@amiga.com</A> or Matt at <A HREF="mailto:matt@amiga.com">matt@amiga.com</A>
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
Gary Peake<BR>
Matt Fontenot<BR>
</P>
<P><B>Suplement:</B></P>
<P>
Amiga, Inc. asks you not to send the above mentioned e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:projects@amiga.com">projects@amiga.com</A>, but to
add your e-mail
address at the bottom of this original message and then to send it in using the &quot;I am
interested!&quot; button.&laquo;
