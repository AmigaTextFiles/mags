<H2>1. Little helpers for everyday Amiga usage (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
Welcome to the latest issue of &quot;Little helpers&quot;. First I want to thank all those people
who sent nice emails after reading the last issue. Bear with me for a correction and an
addition.
</P>
<P>
Correction to &quot;MMULib&quot; by Thomas Richter:
I wrote: &quot;There is no comfortable installer-script available, and with the myriad Amiga
configurations surely it is not possible. The only installation-help is a little
ARexx-Script which can be used to create a config-file.&quot;
I got it all wrong. In fact, there is an installer-script in the archive, but the files
&quot;s:user-startup&quot; and &quot;s:startup-sequence&quot; should be tested manually after the
installation. (Some &quot;MuTools&quot; will be started in the &quot;s:user-startup&quot;, which could cause
problems, but not if they are started in &quot;S:startup-sequence&quot; after &quot;Setpatch&quot;).
My apologies for this oversight. There is the new version 42.4 of the MMULib-Distribution
available on aminet.
</P>
<H3>Addition to &quot;DosTrace&quot;:</H3>
<P>
A reader has sent me a newer version of the system-monitor &quot;DosTrace&quot;. My thanks for
that. It is version 2.20, which is a little different from the previous version 2.13. It
can be downloaded from my homepage (<A HREF="http://members.surfeu.de/68kfreak" TARGET="_top">http://members.surfeu.de/68kfreak</A>).
</P>
<P>
With those out of the way, back to the latest stuff, hopefully correct this time. In this
issue, I want to review the tools &quot;MemIcon&quot;, &quot;MainPrefs&quot;, &quot;VirusExecutor&quot; and &quot;RxTD&quot;.
</P>
<H3>MemIcon:</H3>
<P>
The name implies it all: MemIcon consists of a little AppIcon, which handles all its
functions. MemIcon keeps it simple: it only displays the amount of free memory, the
OS-version and the screen size. Seems inconsequential....unless you want to do a switch
with the screenbar on Workbench 3.9, which lacks this info. And this is the reason for
MemIcon.
</P>
<P>
MemIcon can be configured via tooltypes. You can set the font and its size, the colours,
position, the information to be displayed and a few other things. MemIcon lets you create
a little Info-Box which displays your favourite information.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, owners of Amiga systems with a gfx-card won't be interested in the
exact amount of free chipmem, or the exact number of free fastmem bytes, as shown in the
screen's titlebar. Rounded values like &quot;15.5 MB&quot; would be better.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/Memicon1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Memicon1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="16" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Installation is very easy. The archive consists of a short description and the executable
file.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MemIcon2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MemIcon2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="73" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
MemIcon should be copied to &quot;WBStartup&quot;, to be loaded after the boot process. The
tooltypes are well documented, and some of them are self-evident. You should be aware
that the author has released the program as &quot;alpha&quot;, which normally means a very early,
untested version.
</P>
<P>
On my Configuration (OS3.9/040/CGFX) the program worked fine. The only worry I ran into
was shifting the AppIcon around the screen: the background wasn't restored correctly.
(note of the english renderer: Not unknown late at night on NT4.) Crashes/memory
fragmentation refused to appear.

<H3>MainPrefs:</H3>
<P>
It's the price of progress!!?? With every new OS update the number of preferences
increases. After installing new Datatypes and Tools, each with its own configuration
manager, the chaos grows. So you try to increase the font size, to save your eyesight,
but in a screen full of Preferences, where is the damned Font-Preference...?
</P>
<P>
Martin R. Elsner, the author of &quot;MainPrefs&quot;, seems to have run into this problem ahead of
most of us, and has written a main configuration program.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="72" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
His solution is really nice. Mainprefs uses a ReAction-GUI and doesn't restrict itself to
the ordinary functions like collecting all Preferences into one program. It also sports
an assign editor: all actual assigns and their state are displayed (normal, path, multi
assign, later).
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/MainPrefs2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/MainPrefs2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="61" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The tab files captures a table of all important system files like &quot;user-startup&quot;,
&quot;startup-sequence&quot; or &quot;mountlist&quot;. With a double-click on a file, a previously defined
texteditor will be started. Changes can be made very quickly.
</P>
<P>
The tab programs contains probably the most important part of MainPrefs. All usable
Preferences can be added here. Of course preferences from other applications can be
inserted, too.
</P>
<P>
But MainPrefs should not be seen as a mini-toolmanager. The configuration is a bit
complicated, and MainPrefs doesn't provide any AppWindow-functions. Adding about 50
preferences would be just another soporific piece of work on my system. I decided to add
just the important preferences. This way, the listview stays simple, too (how often does
one change to time zone or the preferred language? My girl-friend doesn't work at UPS! ;)
).
</P>
<P>
Very useful also is the final editor MainPrefs provides - the variables-editor. With this
editor, environment-variables can be changed easily. On the left side the name of the
variable is displayed, on the right side the content.
</P>
<P>
New variables can't be created and Amigans running &quot;HappyEnv&quot; have their own special
problem. Mainprefs only displays the variables found in &quot;ENV:&quot;, and the main point of
&quot;HappyEnv&quot; is to keep variables out of &quot;ENV:&quot; until a program wants them........
</P>
<P>
The installation a snip via amiga-installer. MainPrefs is localized and supports german,
english, italian, french, spanish and turkish. The documentation is available via
amigaguide in german, english and italian.

<H3>VirusExecutor:</H3>
<P>
Thank god it's not often that the Amiga gets influenza - or any other virus. But if it
should happen, VirusExecutor could be your salvation.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/VirusExecutor1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/VirusExecutor1.jpg" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
VirusExecutor uses xfdmaster.library and xvs.library. For protection against the latest
virii, you must always have the latest versions of these two libraries on your system or
bootdisk.
</P>
<P>
Xfdmaster.library lets VirusExecutor decompress various compressed files (e.g.
</P>
<P>
StoneCracker, Imploder, PowerPacker, etc.) and test them for all known virii. The latest
xvs.library keeps VirusExecutor up to date with a definitive virus-database. Get in the
habit of checking Aminet for updates of both libraries if you regularly engage in
internet intercourse of the download kind.
</P>
<P>
VirusExecutor has all the important condom functionality a virus-scanner should have
nowadays. It checks all system vectors for reset-resident programs or virii, has access
to an archive of disc-bootblocks, regularly checks freely definable files and
directories, and can scan whole partitions and archives for link-virii or trojans.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/VirusExecutor2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/VirusExecutor2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="72" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
Most system patches (changed Library Vector Offsets) will be detected by VirusExecutor
and displayed. If unknown LVOs are displayed, the user should panic, it could be a virus.
On the other hand there is no need to jump out of the window, the unknown LVO could be a
new system patch VirusExecutor doesn't know about, because the author hasn't added the
new patch to the patches-database.
</P>
<P>
Users can look into a database (menu &quot;Show/Patches&quot;) and compare the database's patches
with whatever patches are installed on own system. If you find a patch which
VirusExecutor doesn't know, download the latest VEPatchBrain-file from the VE-homepage.
If that does not help, an extensive viruscheck is recommended, and you should send off a
quick email to the author.
</P>
<P>
The user interface is more functional than user friendly - distinct echoes of 1992. On
the other hand VirusExecutor doesn't gobble system resources and fits on the OS3.5+
emergency disk. Users should create a bootdisk complete with VirusExecutor to be able to
check for a virus without booting from hd in case of emergency. Of course, this disc
should be writeprotected.
</P>
<P>
VirusExecutor can be installed without problems via the amiga-installer. There are
catalogs for german, english, dansk, french, italian, norsk, polish, portuguese, slovak
and svenska. Unfortunately, not all parts of VirusExecutor are localized. The
documentation is provided as amigaguide in german and french.

<H3>RxTD:</H3>
<P>
AmigaOS 3.9 has several system patches to upgrade OS2.x/3.1/3.5  with system friendly
code. Unfortunately the odd man out is ToolsDaemon by Nico François. On OS3.9-systems
ToolsDaemon can crash the system. Some OS3.9-users have not struck problems with
ToolsDaemon but they should know that this once-splendid hack could be undermining the
stability of their system. At worst this leads to desperate postings in different
mailinglists, accusing OS3.9 of being the problem, when 3.9 is innocent.
</P>
<P>
Those who can't use ToolsDaemon under 3.9 or even those who don't have problems, should
look at RxTD on aminet. It is a program  that generates the familiar ToolsDaemon-menus
using system friendly ARexx-ports. This whole package is ingenious. Unfortunately the
installation is problematical and in parts incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Installation doesn't use the standard amiga-installer, but a little custom script. There
is no version-checking - newer files won't be copied.
</P>
<P>
After installation, you should manually compare the versions of &quot;libs:wbstart.library&quot;,
&quot;l:wbstart-handler&quot; and &quot;c:wbrun&quot; with those in the RxTD-distribution. All other files
will be correctly copied to the system. ToolsDaemon MUST be moved out of the
wbstartup-directory, if you haven't already done that. The ToolsDaemon-preferences should
not be deleted, as TxTD uses them.
</P>
<P>
After rebooting, the Workbench-menus will be displayed as usual by RxTD, but system
friendly this time. RxTD may have problems with hotkey-definitions saved with
ToolsDaemon. If you get an error message like...
</P>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><PRE>
&quot;7 *-* KEYBOARD ADD NAME &quot;RxTDMIHotKey1&quot; '&quot;Ctrl+LALT+S&quot;' CMD ...
+++ Command returned 10&quot;
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
... on start up, the corresponding hotkey-entry must be removed from ToolsDaemon-prefs.
Changes will only take effect when starting ToolsDaemon-Prefs out of Tools-menu. When
started from WB, changes won't work unless you reboot.
</P>
<P>
The english documentation in amigaguide-format says that the alternative
ToolsDaemon-Preferences &quot;TDPrefs2&quot; on aminet can be used. But on my system it was not
possible to delete menu-entries with TDPrefs2. They weren't displayed by TDPrefs, but it
didn't produce a difference with RxTD.
</P>
<P>
The author of RxTD has promised a full replacement of ToolsDaemon on his homepage. Till
then, you'll have to work around the installation problems and handicaps of RxTD v1.2 and
then wave goodbye to ToolsDaemon.
