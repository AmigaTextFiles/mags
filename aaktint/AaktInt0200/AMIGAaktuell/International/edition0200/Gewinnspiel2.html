<H2>2. Introduction of the new prizes</H2>
<P>
And this is a new chance for all of you to win a prize:
</P>
<P>
Frank Weber gave his program AFiloFaxPro for the competition to us:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;AFiloFaxPro manages your daily life. To do this it offers an extensive personal organizer function and in addition
many features like an electronic notepad or statistic functions, which e.g. log the daily computer run time. (Supports MUI)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
A demo version of the program can be found in the Aminet.
</P>
<P>

Andreas Falkenhahn gave his program NewInstaller for the competition to us:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;There are many software packages in the Aminet without installation program, even if Commodore developped the
Installer program, which offers an easy to use user interface and has also many powerful functions.
</P>
<P>
But many authors do not have the time or are to lazy to write an Installer script. Many of them also found it too difficult.
</P>
<P>
But this time is over. NewInstaller makes it possible for any author to include an Installer script with his software package.
But stop - you do not have to write the script yourself - NewInstaller does this for you fully automatically.
</P>
<P>
The only thing you have to do is to add an icon with the default tool NewInstaller to your software package.
In addition you can set further options using the tool types.
</P>
<P>
NewInstaller is completely integrated into the Internet. You just have to add two tool types and the user can register
your program online, if he wants to. Or you add a tool type and he can directly browse to your Internet homepage!
</P>
<P>
But there is more: NewInstaller can make the installation to a first class multimedia event. It can show various pictures
and play samples and modules. And it does not matter, if the installation runs on AGA/ECS/OCS/graphic boards or whatsoever...
The pictures are always shown in the best possible quality and adjusted to the Workbench colours as well to the Workbench's size!
</P>
<P>
Many things can be changed with the Tool types.
</P>
<P>
I decided to release NewInstaller as Shareware.
</P>
<P>
If you register and want to get your key file per eMail, this costs 10 DEM (approx. 5.10 Euros). If you want to receive it
per mail on floppy disk the price raises to 15 DEM (approx. 2.65 Euros)!
</P>
<P>
A demo version (apart from the nerv requester fully operational) can be downloaded from the Airsoft Softwair Homepage (<A HREF="http://airsoft.home.pages.de/" TARGET="_top">http://airsoft.home.pages.de/</A>)
or from the Aminet laden (<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~aminet/util/wb/NewInstaller1_5.lha">util/wb/NewInstaller1_5.lha</A>).&laquo;
</P>
<P>
In addition Thomas Hasemann gave the network and Internet client software AmiTCP/IP to us.
</P>
<P>
Our thanks goes to all the donators!
