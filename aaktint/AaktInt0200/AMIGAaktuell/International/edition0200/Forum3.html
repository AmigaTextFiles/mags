<H2>3. Thoughts about Amiga (by Gerd Engelmann)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Since 1989 I use the Amiga, esteemed it as a fast, easy to attend computer.
What constitutes the Amiga first of all is its lean operating system, the
hardware is of secondary importance. All things considered for me there is
no difference, if the TurboCalc table is calculated by a Motorola 68k
processor, by a PPC or by an Intel chip. Would there be the AmigaOS in the
same extent and with equal speed on another platform, this was allright for
me. Unfortunately there is none, so I have to work with my old A2000.</P>
<P>
But seriously: besides of my Amiga additionally I use a fast PC, which in
the meantime I violateed with different operatin systems. Of course there
is Windows, aside of it I installed Linux and since a few months BeOS, too.
On the Amiga I use via emulation the Mac with MacOS 8.0. But the most jobs
I still do with the Amiga. Somehow funny! Why?</P>
<P>
Well, about Windows there isn't much to say, I don't see, why Win 3.11
became the standard OS, not to mention Win 9x. The beginnings were not bad,
but it failed at the realisation. The whole structure of Windows should
be forgotten! As a user you have no overall view over the system, because
(to my opinion) it is made up completely chaotic. Even professionals have
their difficulties with it.</P>
<P>
Linux is a fine thing for people with a liking to make experiments, but not
good for the normal user. This I do say as one, who gets along quite well
with Linux. And as this I recognize the weak spots. It still is to complicated
to install Linux, not mentioning the use of the whole system. As said before,
just super for freaks.</P>
<P>
MacOS, noble, cool, and an alternative to AmigaOS!? I like it quite well and
it really is foolproof, as it should be. But where is multitasking???? Anyone
who intensely uses MT on the Amiga like I do, knows what I mean. And if you
wish to have a deeper look into the operating system, MacOS will be not of
much help.</P>
<P>
But finally BeOS: This is, what I am longing for. It is closest to AmigaOS,
is very fast, makes multitasking at its best and looks quite up-to-date.
Unfortunately there are not enough applications and it does not run on an
Amiga.</P>
<P>
So only the Amiga is left over. I rather surf with the Amiga over the net,
write my emails better with YAM than with Outlook and for nearly everything
else I prefer the Amiga. The PC is mostly used for jobs, where the calculating
speed is valid, thus MP3 coding and raytraceing. To work with the Amiga is
just fun, it is, I'm sorry, frustrating with the PC. I cannot understand anyone
saying, there is no more sense in working with an Amiga. Everyone owning a well
equipped computer of this brand can do anything you can imagine. Of course it
might be fine, if there was more good software and I am looking forward eagerly
for a new Amiga, but until then I get along with my computer quite well.</P>
<P>
I hope, that the new owners of the Amiga rights put up something great, but it
ought to be similar with the existing, working with it must simply be fun.</P>
<P>
All these are my personal opinions. I don't want to start an Amiga-PC
discussion, but just wish to make known my thoughts. I don't object other
views, anybody who wants to pass them on to me is asked to do so.</P>
