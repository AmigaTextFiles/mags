Description: This game is a remake of an old game from the 80s. So are graphics and game idea. You represent a wolf
that has to collect eggs, which come from 4 ways. This is done using 4 keys, which make you go to the ways. The
game has two different speeds. If one egg falls down you get a chicken, which shows the number of failures. If you
collected 3 the game is over and you have to begin again.</P>
<P>
The game is really for fans, who were fascinated from the LCD games. But due to the same idea over and over again
they should be bored, soon.</P>

Description: At last another a graphic adventure in the style of Monkey Island. And it is much more crazy than this classic.
You represent Erika Evermore, who awakes in a (dream) world after eating some mushrooms. There are a lot of strange
people and things (slimey alien king, crazy professor...). Now you have to solve some problems (e.g. destroying the
universe) as in any adventure game.<BR>
With this game you get a crazy grahic design, which is not as good as in games like Sixth Sense Investigations, but
it supports the mood. The sound is between really good to nerve killing, but it seems to be wanted that way.
It really is a good game. Due to the theme the puzzles are not always logical, but they are fun. The game currently
consists of part 1 and 2 only. If there is enough interest the author wants to put in the last part, too. So, fill in
the included form, please.</P>

Description: This game is also a remake of a classic.
This time the spectrum game HotShot gave the idea.
The player controls his game figure using a joystick or the keyboard and tries to move the ball on his side using a
magnetic stick and then to shoot it against the bricks at the ceiling to destroy them. But either the computer or an
opponent controlled by another player is on the same game field and tries to get the ball, too.
You can imagine the game as a mixture of Breakout/Arcanoid and a pinball game.
The graphics are useful and sound is nearly not existant. But the game is at least for a short time period interesting,
especially, if you play it with another person.</P>

Description: According to the author this game is a wipeout clone. This sounds good, but it shows up as a very poor game.
The graphics are not in 3D, but the images of the gliders keep their positions while the course is moving towards them.
You do not nice it with other games, but in this game it looks very funn, if the trist graphics comes towards you.
There is not very much of a game idea, too. You just speed up and the curves you notice too late can be driven through
without slowing down anyway. Due to the bad controls the shooting down of the opponents does not offer fun, too.
This game could not recommend to the fans of those games, too.</P>
