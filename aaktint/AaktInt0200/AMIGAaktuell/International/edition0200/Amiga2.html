<B>Las Vegas, January 8, 2000 -</B> Amiga Incorporated, a privately held company based in Maple Valley, WA, has entered
into a strategic relationship with the Tao Group as the new content platform foundation partner for the new Amiga. Terms
of the transaction were not disclosed.<BR>
Bill McEwen, Amiga President/CEO, said that the company selected Tao as the foundation partner for the new Amiga after
reviewing numerous other potential partners.

<P>
&quot;After extensive research trawling the markets we found that Tao had the greatest similarities and strengths with
our vision, and the capabilities to get the job done&quot;. McEwen said.  &quot;Amiga with Tao together will  bring a new
level of capabilities, portability and scalability never available before.&quot;<BR><BR>
&quot;Tao has its roots in the Amiga so this is particularly satisfying for us&quot; said Francis Charig, Chairman and
CEO of Tao Group.  &quot;What makes this relationship so exciting to Tao is the relationship we can enjoy with  Amiga
and the Amiga Community. The world has changed radically in the last few years and there is a vacuum in terms of content
and software environments that meets the needs of the mass market. The skill sets of the Amiga community combined with the
power and flexibility of Tao's software infrastructure means that the New Amiga can create the most compelling content for
the emerging digital services and content markets.&quot;
