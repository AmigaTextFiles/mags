<U>Fleecy Moss explains the plans of AMIGA (January 15, 2000)</U><BR>
</P><P>
In a newsgroup Fleecy Moss of AMIGA Inc. explained the plans of the company:
</P><P>
»In my trawling around the community hangouts,<BR>
I have come across several misconceptions, rumours,<BR>
and a lot of confusion. Whilst I can't hope to answer <BR>
everything, here are some things I want to set straight.<BR>
</P><P>
</P><P>
0. Amiga will build a digital content universe. Digital<BR>
   content means anything composed of 0 and1 - <BR>
   applications, video, audio, games, emails, whatever.<BR>
   We will focus on 2 markets, the pathfinder market,<BR>
   for digital adventurers, power users, gamers,<BR>
   content creators, DTPers, artists, video  ppl<BR>
   and those who refuse to define a computer as<BR>
   a digital appliance. Our second market will <BR>
   cocentrate on the Domestic Digital Habitat (DDH).<BR>
</P><P>
1. If you are a personal computer person, there will<BR>
   be a personal computer second wave Amiga.<BR>
</P><P>
2. We will support classic development in so much<BR>
   as we want to help users and developers transition<BR>
   to a new machine. That will be the total extent of our<BR>
   support for the classic machine. If this involves further<BR>
   AmigaOS releases, then so be it.<BR>
</P><P>
3. We are targetting x86 and PPC for the first consumer<BR>
   release of Pathfinder products (if you are a personal <BR>
   computer person, this means you).<BR>
</P><P>
4. We will do everything in our power (that doesnt bankrupt <BR>
   us or interfere with our primary goals) to ensure classic <BR>
   Amiga  software runs on the new machine in some form or <BR>
   another.. The new Amiga product family (formerly called <BR>
   AQUA) will run natively and hosted. This is to create a large <BR>
   market fast  for Amiga developers to profit from. For the first <BR>
   pathfinder release it will run hosted to see this market grow <BR>
   fast. We see one of our core duties as serving the developers.<BR>
</P><P>
6. We are talking to the Phoenix Consortium about common <BR>
   interests. <BR>
</P><P>
7. We have been contacted by QNX but currently have no plans <BR>
   to work with them.<BR>
</P><P>
8. We will develop Amiga products for another market, the <BR>
   Domestic Digital Habitat (DDH) market. This markets will <BR>
   be kept separate but products will work together if the installer <BR>
   so desires it.<BR>
</P><P>
9. There will be a new website and it will be public shortly. It has <BR>
   been tested on all browsers, Amiga and non Amiga, and given <BR>
   the compatibility problems between the implementations of open <BR>
   standards, our best effort has been made. The site   will grow <BR>
   quickly and more information will be added. We want it to become a<BR>
   village where all Amigans can come to voice their opinions, chat, <BR>
   and travel off  to different parts of the Amiga universe.<BR>
</P><P>
a. A developer support manager has been selected and they are <BR>
   working  on implementing   the developer support program. This will <BR>
   be in  place before the developer boxes are released.<BR>
</P><P>
b. The developer boxes are specced out, we have contacted several <BR>
   whitebox manufacturers and we are building the distribution.<BR>
</P><P>
c. Amiga will not provide dates until we have a product. We will share <BR>
   timelines, but will not attach dates to them. Enough damage has <BR>
   already been done.<BR>
</P><P>
d. We have had acceptances from 75% of our development team and<BR>
   their names and roles will be announced once we get back from <BR>
   training (before the end of the month).<BR>
</P><P>
This mail can be redistributed without modification within the community. <BR>
As further questions and issues come up, we will attempt to answer them.«<BR>
