<H2>2. Hardware test: Testreport IOBlix1200 Parallel with Iomega ZIP100 (by Dennis Trabandt)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;First of all, you have to take the IOBlix out of the box. You will find
a disk with the drivers, a slot sheet with the connector and a small
circuit board. The IOBlix has to be connected to the clockport. Finally
place the slot sheet in the designated mounting position in the case.
</P><P>Now connect the ZIP100 to the parallelport.</P>
<P>
After starting your computer, install the software for the IOBLix using
the "Install" program from the floppy disk.
After successful installation, run the programm "Install Parallel ZIP".
This copies a device and a few dosdrivers to your harddisk, namely PZIP0
and PZIPC, the latter is for PC ZIP disks.
After rebboting, you can format the ZIP disk for Amiga or for PC.
Formatting a ZIP disk can take a long time. Fortunately you can use
quick format. The formatted capacity of the disk is only 95MB. Why?
I have no idea.
The transfer rate according to SysInfo is about 168 kB/s. This is not very
fast, so backups can take quite a while.
</P>
<P>
Well, the ZIP works now, but you have no tools, because Iomega only supplies
PC software. (In my opinion, an untolerable situation, which is common in the
whole peripheral producing industry, for example scanners, printers, etc.) :(
</P>
<P>
Several programs from Aminet can provide a solution. I've chosen Z100 from
Thomas Omilian (Aminet: disk/misc/z100.lha), which is shareware (you have
to send a music CD to the author). The good thing about Z100 is that it
configures itself during the installation, all devices and units will be
selected automatically.

<P>
The package contains:

(The eject buttons works again only after a reboot.)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Note:&nbsp;</TD><TD>If you plan to use Windows9x ZIP disks frequently, you should consider to get yourself CrossDos7, which supports DOS 8.3, making it possbile to
use filenames up to 30 characters long. A review of CrossDos7 can be found in Aminet.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">Result:&nbsp;</TD><TD>With the IOBlix and Z100, you can use a ZIP drive (almost) as good as with the original tools from Iomega.
Most people will have a lot of fun using the Iomega ZIP, and for all who need more than 95 MB on a disk, there is also the ZIP 250.
I will test it in the next issue.</TD></TR></TABLE>
