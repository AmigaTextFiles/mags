<H2>5. Introduction: CD&sup3;&sup2;-Alliance</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Dear Readers of Amiga aktuell International,</P>
<P>
certainly one or the other among you will have a CD³² sitting around at
home, possible even with the additional SX-1 or SX32 module, and your
opinion is, that not enough is done for CD32. Exactly this is the opinion
of Dieter as well as Thorsten Schoelzel and Manuel Gatz, and together we
form the CD32-Alliance.</P>
<P>
In connection with dealers, soft- and hardware manufacturers our aim is to
bring the already dead CD32 market back to live again. We ask all those
having a CD32 resp. all CD32 fans to assist us. Because again it depends on
you, if there will be new releases for CD32 or not. Therefore we ask you to
participate in the inquiry, which is recently held e.g. in CD32-Corner. The
CD32-Corner may be accessed with the following URL:<A HREF="http://home.t-online.de/home/amiga-freak">http://home.t-online.de/home/amiga-freak</A></P>
<P>
Our inquiry can only be successful, if everyone participates on it. The
break even point is at 500 CD32 users, that is, at least 500 users, better
more, have to take part in the inquiry. Because for 10 or 20 users no
manufacturer will produce a 3D extension or a MPEG module.</P>
<P>
Moreover the CD32-Alliance will carry on the development of the &quot;CD32 Tips-
Guide&quot;, which may be available, as this Amiga aktuell International appears. There are
lots of novelties ... Among others there will be a new name, starting with
version 20 the &quot;CD32 Tips-Guide&quot; will be called &quot;CD32 Cheats-Guide&quot;. You'll
find it on the same homepage (in the games area) as well as in the Aminet.
There are hints & tricks for appr. 60 CD32 games.</P>
<P>
Note: In Aminet the CD32 Cheats-Guide will appear as &quot;CD32-Tips.lha&quot; for
download. A change to &quot;CD32Cheats-lha&quot; is planned with the next version.</P>
<P>
We kindly ask you to visit us in the CD32-Corner and let us know your
opinion.</P>
<P>
On the homepage, which will be &quot;powerd by CD32-Alliance&quot;, you will find
lots of informations around the C32 and everything ever developed for it.
Be it the MPEG module, the extensions SX-1, SX32, the CD32 joypad ...</P>
<P>
Before long further pages will go online, the first one will be a support
page for developers, to explain how the games they programmed are made to
run on CD32. What is needed and exactly how it is done, you will learn it
there.</P>
<P>
Well, did you take a fancy to it and do you plan to buy a CD32? No problem
at all, just have a look at our classified advertisements, maybe you find
it right away.</P>
<P>
Right here I wish to call you up, beeing a CD32 user having informations
round about the CD32 or knowing about dealers still offering soft- and
hardware for the CD32, or beeing a software programmer developing software
for this console, please let us know about it.</P>
<P>
We would be glad, if the CD32-Alliance logo might soon decorate your
homepage. Please get in touch with us.</P>
<P>
Attention software developers: You developed a game for CD32 and don't
know how to present it to the rank and file? No problem, just contact us
and soon your product may be found in the dealer's shelfs. Please talk to
us about further conditions.</P>
<P>
A software product distributed by the CD32-Alliance will become &quot;powered by
CD32-Alliance&quot;.</P>
