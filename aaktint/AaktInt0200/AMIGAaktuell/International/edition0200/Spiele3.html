<P><B>Hi!</B></P>
<P>
In front of you there is a new edition of the AMIGA aktuell international games section. This month there are some
reviews again, which are from Immortal, Max Rally and Foundation DC. At this place I want to thank my guest reviewers
Carsten Schroeder and Chrism&auml;n from the Starmag and point out, that everybody can test games for the AMIGA aktuell
games section. Just save the complete ASCII or HTML file and send it to me. Just remember: This games section can only
kept alive with your help! So there is a Mac corner by Andreas Koch and PD-games from the Aminet by Heiko Garrets, this
month.</P>
<P>
So, I want to say a few words about the current Amiga situation: I think very, very positive about the buying of Amiga by
Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss. Because these persons are enthusiastic Amiga users themselves, they might be the best to
know what has to be done, now. I think, they will make decisions, which are shared by the Amiga community, because they
are in close contact with the community and are members themselves. So, it can only become for better! The only thing I
worry about is their money. The further development is going to cost much money and has to be made (if there is no
&quot;secret&quot; sponsor). So, let's wait to see what's going to happen. However, things are going to change faster
as we are used to it from Gateway.</P>
<P>
On this note, have fun with this edition,</P>
