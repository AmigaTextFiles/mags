<H2> EXECUTIVE UPDATE</H2><BR>
<B>February 4, 2000</B><BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<p>Greetings to one and all:

</P><P>A great deal has occurred over the last couple of weeks, and it is only going to get more interesting as we move forward. It has been some time since I spoke with you, and I wanted to share some of the fun.
</P><P>In the last two weeks we have announced our new foundation partner, started technical training with our new development team, and had many meetings with future technology partners
</P><P>The responses have been overwhelmingly positive and, to quote an old song "they ain't seen nothing yet".
</P><P>On January 8, 2000 at CES in Las Vegas we announced our partnership with the Tao-Group as our foundation OS partner.  This is not just a technical but a strategic relationship and brings with it great rewards.  I have asked Fleecy to write a short document highlighting the Amiga/Tao relationship from a more technical perspective, to save you from having to put up with my telling everyone how incredibly great and fantastic it is. We want you to make your own minds up.
</P><P>In the next two weeks we will make another strategic partnership announcement with regards to the new path for Amiga. As with all our announcements, look at it against
the whole picture and not in isolation.
</P><P>After a week long trip to Germany and the UK I have come back with a much better understanding of what we can and cannot do.  As mentioned before we are not going to make promises or product announcements.  We will announce to you, the community, only after the deal is signed or the product is sitting before us.  This won't put a stop to rumours, but it will make them all the more obvious. Change brings uncertainty, and in an information vacuum, mischief makers like to take the spotlight. If it isn't officially sanctioned by Amiga, don't believe it.
</P><P>Our job as a company is to create exciting market opportunities for Amiga developers to take advantage of, and to give Amiga users a platform they can enjoy.  This requires more than just an upgrade to the existing OS.  This requires, indeed demands a complete strategy reaching into all areas of the present and the future. The time has come for all of us to move forwards, owner, developer, and user.
</P><P>Many of you have sent us business proposals, and product marketing ideas, and for this we thank you, and ask for your patience as we look over them.  Some are providing us with valuable insight into the desires of the Amiga community as a whole, others are providing us with a good chuckle. This is the Amiga advantage that other platforms just do not share.
</P><P>Over the next few months there may be some companies that come out with their own plans, or state that we do not have the community at heart as we move forwards.  The reality is, they do not know what we have planned.  In order to stay focused and to keep up our incredible pace, we are not sharing our plans outside of our signed partnerships.
</P><P>We have to prioritise and act singlemindedly if we are to reach our first plateau in our given timescales. Once there we will be able to pause for breath. Some are not happy about this, but they do not know the full plan. Our mission is not just about restoring the Amiga, but about pushing it forwards as THE technology for tomorrow.
</P><P>This means that if you hear something annoying, or frustrating, or downright nasty, and the source  is not Amiga Inc, then disregard it.
</P><P>Plain and simple.
</P><P>If you did not hear it from us, or read it here on this web site it is not true.
</P><P>We are not asking for your trust or your undying belief.  We only ask that you take us on OUR words and deeds, not on the  misinterpretations of others.
</P><P>We will soon be starting  official meetings in Europe, the UK, and the US for developers and dealers.  This will include introductory training seminars for the new OS, and introductions to the retail pricing and schedules.  We will also begin the process of introducing the new web site, and putting the Amiga Advisory Council to work.
</P><P>I want to thank each and every one of you for your hospitality during our meetings and for your continued support as we move forwards.  We have had the chance to meet with many end users, developers, dealers, and new partners, and look forwards to meeting even more of you as time goes on.
</P><P>There is a great deal of activity, with a lot of first footsteps on some  truly amazing paths.  New partners excited, old faces returning, familiar faces reminding us of our heritage. Indeed  we are already having to move into bigger facilities, such is our rate of growth.
</P><P>I know it can be frustrating but after years wandering lost in a dark place, the sun is finally starting to crack a smile on the horizon. Together, we will march into tomorrow.
</P><P>Keeping the faith,
</P><P>Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga Team.
