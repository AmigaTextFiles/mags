<H2>4. Report about the Meeting with Bill McEwen and Petro Tyschtschenko</H2>
<P>
</P>
Information Meeting with Bill McEwen and Petro Tyschtschenko on
Januar 17, 2000 at ESPRIX HOTEL, Rhein-Main Airport, Frankfurt.
</P><P>
This meeting, according to the words of Bill McEwen intentionally held
in Germany as the first one after the foundation of the new Amiga
Incorporated , was meant to inform developers, distributors and press about
plans and strategies, that will ensure the future of our computer. The
audience consisted of appr. 30 participants (estimated, sorry, I had
forgotten to count), who had travelled by from all parts of Germany.
A few minutes after 15 o'clock the meeting was opened by Petro Tyschtschenko.

</P>
<P>
There were no written documents, only the NDA (Confidentality and Non-
Disclosure Agreement) had to be signed by each participant and obliged
him not to disclose anything connected with the business policy of
Amiga. Unfortunately this covers all and everything beeing of high
interest for us, namely the hard- and software outfit of future Amiga
computers, but as well the financial conditions of the new company
and their partners have to be kept in silence.
</P><P>
Bill McEwen freely spoke about his views and ideas, jumping in good temper
from topic to topic (... and his "yankee drawl" made it for the one or
the other, including the reporter of this, a bit difficult to follow him
everywhere).
</P><P>
First and later on as well Bill regretted, that the unfortuate proceedings
of Gateway have thrown back the development for three years. Wheras the
management at first had supported the development of the Amiga, after
a change in the upper level the heading was completely reversed.
</P><P>

</P>
<P>
Again and again it came clear, that for Bill the idea of the Amiga is
a vision, which to follow he called up all friends of the Amiga. If this
what he explained about the new possibilities will come true, we may
really expect great things. Of course, as usual, not everybody will enjoy
it, but we will have to live up to this. The business policy of Amiga
by all means seems to be quite reasonable.
</P><P>
To my opinion of very high importance is the definite assistance for
developers and programmers, which was expressively promised. Hardware
equipment and software pakets for this purpose will be made available as
soon as possible. A date in February is looked upon for release.
</P><P>
We, the endusers, may already in this year, possibly in late summer, be
able to buy the New Amiga. And it is planned to concentrate upon the
Christmas season. Precise data and dates will be released, as soon as they
are known. There is the impression, that Amiga Inc. itself will not
produce the hardware. Concerning the software, especially the operating
system, the cooperation with the new partner TAO seems to be indicated.
</P><P>
The classic Amiga (after a remark out of the audience Bill later on
solely used the expression "current Amiga") will be supported as far as
possible, further developments of the OS are not excluded.
</P><P>
Finally Bill called upon all developers to talk to and to cooperate with
Amiga Inc. to prevent incorrect developments. He generally asked to keep
a close contact with him. In this connection he accentuated, that the AAC
(Amiga Advisory Council) will be addressed again and will actively be
engaged in the further development.
</P><P>
Amiga Incorporated does not plan to participate at usual fairs and
expositions, but will arrange events on it's own. It is important to create
a market and to introduce the Amiga as a brand to the wide public. Jokingly
Bill stated, that even CNN already had perceived Amiga's intentions and he
had given them an interview, which especially in his family was highly
appraised!
</P><P>
Repeatedly and again at the end Bill accentuated his feelings about the
Amiga community and expressed his gratitude, that they never abandoned their
hope. He is amazed, how in these last three years enthusiasts still have
created novel software and hardware. He thanked all of them and again
asked to keep up the connection to him. His email address and his phone
number are well known. Whenever he is in his office, he will pick up
the phone by himself.
</P><P>
The official meeting terminated at about 17.30, most of the audience met
for some talks in the bar. The reporter skipped this part, unfortunately,
because afterwards he learned that Petro Tyschtschenko had invited the
press people for a conversation, which was not announced before.
