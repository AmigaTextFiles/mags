<H2>4. Impulse for a Diskussion: Missing Social Behaviour (by Robert Wahnsiedler)</H2>
<P>
The following I'd like to place under discussion: 
</P>
<P>
&raquo;On Amiga 3 practices have spread, which I really care about and I'd like
to start a discussion over them. 
</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>In Usenet and all other fora there only two kinds of people are writing,
to my feeling there are some &quot;dumb&quot; PC users rsp. ex amigans,
who squabble around, and the TOTAL CREAM, who get excited about every so
little fault.
<P>
The discussion goes for weeks, because someone posted a file of just a few
bytes; there are scarcely any subjects connected to Amiga and mails from
users with genuine problems with their Amigas are completely ignored.
There is a ruthless nonsense talk but no one is willing to change the
situation. I experienced it with my two projects, one was ADSG, which was
planned to be like SASG (just better) and the second was AmiWolfenDoom.
</P>
<P>
No help in any way, not even with a simple mail. The Amiga was known for the
way users were assisting each other, we ought to remember this according
to the slogan &quot;BACK TO THE ROOTS&quot; and just enjoy, that we still
have an Amiga. I'd like to say this to all Amiga users, who read your
magazin, that not all resemble those in DCSA.misc or #amigager.
</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI>This is a mail to all PROGRAMMERS/COMPANIES. It seems to have come
into fashion to prefinance all and everything on the Amiga. Or before a
program is initiated, they are looking on relevant news sites for
prospective customers. This cannot be the real solution, I for myself know
more than ten Amiga user NOT having access to the internet. They enter a
shop and want to buy something and they cannot participate at those votes.
About all this pople should bother before they scream &quot;I only received
100 emails, what means, there is no interest&quot;.
<P>
The specific inducement for this mail was FUSION PPC. I'd like to have
this program and I'd certainly enjoy PCX PPC as well, but under these
conditions they wouldn't sell a single piece on  a PC.
</P>
<P>
All this fuss about prefinancing, and will the program be released or will
it not? An acquaintance of me paid in advance and what is it all about?
Due date at 20. November has gone by and the excuse was, that not enough
people had paid. And I had believed Blittersoft had taken over the
remainders!

And then Blittersoft get excited, that until now only 300 (latest state)
had paid etc......... The additionally necessary 200 will easyly be found,
if the program finally is on sale.
</P>
<P>
To prefinance a product seems to be ok, but they cannot cash in the whole
sale in advance. I just don't believe, that FUSION PPC can only be sold
500 times! I shall buy it, but only if it is free on sale. That means,
only 199 are missing. :)
</P><BR></LI>
<LI>Is there someone having a connection with SASG? I believe it is a
real nasty mess, what happens there. You don't find the authors, zero
support, homepage outdated, but they don't hesitate to readyly cash in the
money! Why am I setup like this? After I recognized, that it is very
difficult to order MUI via snail mail I bought a keyfile with my credit
card for a friend.
</P>
<P>
In the comment field I had written that the keyfile was not to be made
out for me, because I already have one! Of course a keyfile arrived with
my name in it, upon the mails from me and my friend until today we received
no answer. Now he works with MUI with my name (looks really good :() and
of course is quite dissapointed. His readiness for further sales now isn't
so high anymore.
</P>
<P>
As positive example I wish to mention the people of of Aliendesign (Scalos),
who sent me a keyfile with the correct name within a few days!!!
</P>
<P>
The Amiga market has become very small and I believe just out of this
reason we ought to pin the black sheep to the wall, that the Amiga users
may not be struck even more.
