<H1>News from AMIGA</H1>
<H2>1. The sale of the AMIGA rights - your opinions</H2>
<P>
In the laste (German) edition we asked for your opion about the sale of the AMIGA rights to Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss.
Here they re:
</P>
<P>
Lars Wache means: &raquo;I think quite optimistic about the Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss thing. Quite often e were
being disappointed by other companies - also by Gateway, so I can only say: Let's wait and see what the new team is going
to make out of our girlfriend. If they would be acompanied by Jim Collas, everything can only become better.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolf Zimmer thinks about the sale of the rights as &raquo;the only remaining hope&laquo;.
</P>
<P>
Hans Happe also thinks positive about it:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;You asked for the opinion of the Amiga users about the overtake.
</P>
<P>
Well, I expect it to be a great chance, the this platform, we got used to, does not decline completely. We, the users, know
that it is still fun working with it, even if the power of the processor is no longer state-of-the-art. So, dear Mr. McEwen
and Mr. Moss, now build the Amiga with more processor power for a reasonable price using the Amiga concept, which does not
necessarily mean, that the operating system must not change. It has to change, to follow the current needs (DVD, digital
editing etc.). If this can be accomplished using Linux or any other component is irrelevant: The most important thing is,
that the Amiga feeling is not lost.
</P>
<P>
And we, the Amiga user, should promote more offensive for the Amiga concept, so new markets can be conquered.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Muench is waiting for the new models:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;In addition to my comment to the question of opinion 12/99 I can evaluate the sale nearly just positive!
Two people made it, who have the knowledge about the potential of the Amiga, in the contrary to Gateway. The question
is, how they want to boost the Amiga market. According to the informations I got they want to continue the NG concept.
But I have my doubts, if this system had something in common with the Amiga-look-and-feel. Let's wait and see. Once
bitten, I do not expect too much from Amino.
</P>
<P>
They should give the licence for porting the OS to CHRP especially to Haage &amp; Partner (even if I do not like WarpUP
very much); first contacts have been made, I think. I personally think, that the development with the PowerPC was
more interesting, because it is no harsh break with the ClassicAmiga and it represents an open platform, which anyone
may produce. This strategy helped the IBM compatible to success. In addition this platform has just the MacOS.
If a fast, save Amiga-OS was convincing, this could raise the ratio of presence of the Amiga. I hope, Amino thinks about
this.
</P>
<P>
If the NG-Amiga (should it come) be that great as the A 1000, I would not lock this technology out! In the meantime I
have made some experiences with MacOS and WinDOS and I made the first steps with Linux. They all do not come even close
to the current Amiga system. So the NG-Amiga has to become revolutionary.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Nils Goers &raquo;doesn't mind&laquo; about the taking over of AMIGA.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Markus Lunk thinks about it &raquo;quite positive, if the financial situation was not so uncertain. Let's hope, that
Jim enters the company as soon as possible! The finances are my only concern. That Bill and Fleecy are two of us and
have the knowledge, is out of the question.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gerd Engelmann's opinion is this:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I really am pleased about the developement since beginning of the year.
After I had let down all my hope about a respectable successor of Amiga
and put up with having to work with my A 2000 until its technical breakdown
now a new computer again comes into reach. And even more than ever!
</P>
<P>
Because now the rights are in the hands of people, who appreciate, what Amiga was
and still is.
</P>
<P>
The announcements of the last days sound very promising, the cooperation
with the TAO group I consider very positive, even if there is not much known
about their projects.
</P>
<P>
But I deeply hope as well, that Haage & Partner will not be forgotten, because
theirs are the deserts, that not even more users have turned away from Amiga..&laquo;
</P>
<P>Fritz Trampnau writes:</P>
<P>
&raquo;I have to say, that I have no idea about the new AMIGA sale, in the moment. Sure, B. McEwen made some statements
 - also about the AMIGA - in the past and I am quite sure, that he will give some more statements - but now we reached
 the point, where nothing more is believed and there are no more hopes - WHITE OUT - horizon and landscape became one -
in which direction it might go, you always see the same - so we go forward and soon we go in a circle - and - turn around
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
BUT: At the latest in spring the WITE OUT is gone and there are new AMIGAs in summer!<BR>
So keep on walking - the ones said dead live longer than they believed it themselves!<BR>
On this note -
</P>
<P>AMIGA forever!!&laquo;</P>
<P>Dieter Schoo is optimistic:</P>
<P>
&raquo;They say there were 5 million dollars paid for Amiga. This much money cannot be paid from the pocket of your jeans,
but there are people behind this, who pay. And they want to get their money back, quite soon and with interests. So they
take a close look, before giving the money.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: The Aminos showed a concept, which is convincing!
</P>
<P>I hope, that</P>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> the buying of AMIGA was due to the interest about the &quot;Amiga&quot; (could be expected with Bill McEwen and
Fleecy Moss) and</LI>
<LI> there is enough money to make their ideas com true and</LI>
<LI> they keep in mind what is the development about, so the Amiga will always be up-to-date.</LI></OL>
<P>
Then we will get a new system, which will get the current Amiga freacs enthusiastic about it (of course, after the
necessary grumbling and demonizing as it has to be for real Amigans! ;-) ).&laquo;
