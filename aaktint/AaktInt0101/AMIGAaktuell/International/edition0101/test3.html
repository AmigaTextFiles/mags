<H2>3. Hardware test: 19&quot; monitor &quot;Iiyama S900MT1&quot; (by Klaus Moddemann)</H2>
<P>
Not long ago Iiyama announced their 19&quot; S900MT1 for 769 DM. Because I needed a new
monitor I bought one at the exhibition in Cologne and ordered it at cool bits. Because
they had no monitors available at the exhibition they sent me one through German Parcel
two weeks later directly from Iiyama. A manual, power connection, warranty booklet and
the obligatory rotating leg were included.
</P>
<P>
The SM901MT1 was snugly packed into a huge cardboard box so that damage was nearly
impossible. After taking the monitor out of the box and plugging it in, it didn't seem to
work. The only message the display showed was: &quot;Attention! Out of Range!&quot;, at the same
time displaying some utopian and totally ridiculous frequencies. The next step was to
reconnect the old display and check the old frequencies.
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? The display should have been working at frequencies of 48 and 75 Hz. I
set the CGX-presets to the 80 kHz display, changed the screen mode and reconnected the
Iiyama again - and it worked. No further startup difficulties emerged. After this I
adapted all screen modes with CGX to the new display - ready!
Life with the S900MT1 is much more fun than the old 15&quot; model: having installed the
screen modes correctly you get a brilliant, sharp and steady picture which leaves nothing
to be desired. This is down to the 0.26mm dot pitch.
</P>
<P>
For fine tuning the extensive on-screen display can be used to eliminate any errors with
trapezoids, convergence and parallelograms.
</P>
<P>
The display includes five preinstalled screen modes and 20 storage slots that can be
adapted to your computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Overall: The display seems to be well assembled and has got a 36 month bring-in warranty.
Anybody looking for an inexpensive 19&quot; display that works out of the box would do worse
than choose the Iiyama.
