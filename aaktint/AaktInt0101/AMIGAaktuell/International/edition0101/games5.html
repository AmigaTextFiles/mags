<H2>5. Review: &raquo;Ermentrud - Souped up and vegging on the ridiculous&laquo;</H2>
<P>
Inutilis Software has dared to put a serious adventure into a loony story. Good adventure
or a tired medieval joke?
</P>
<P>
Monkey Island made point and click adventures bestsellers on the Amiga and it has had
many honourable successors. The newer ones of this type are Nightlong (Clickboom) and
Simon the Sorcerer II (Epic Interactive). And now there is another one: Ermentrud. You
have to ask if this game can hold its own against the competition: the programmer team is
only one person (and will be busy with A-level exams soon).
</P>
<P>
Ermentrud only runs on CGFX screens at 640*480 and 8bit on Amigas with Workbench 3.x.
That´s valiant. Support of graphic boards is very commendable, but graphic board and CGFX
as minimum? I suppose it does show a desire to make a good game. There will be about 40
locations, all backgrounds painted by hand and colored on the Amiga. And sound as well
(spoken words and background music with AHI).
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a good project, doesn´t it? So, what´s it all about?
</P>
<P>
A head of cabbage (literally!) has kidnapped the usual princess while her guards are
drinking in the &quot;Bei Helga&quot; tavern. The King sends for Ermentrud (the Hero) and tells him
to bring the princess back because she is supposed to be married to Prince R&uuml;bensupp
(turnip soup).
</P>
<P>
Ermentrud gallops off and on his journey visits the medieval capital of King Pilsener,
the semi-oriental island of Thymian (thyme), a neighbouring land where resin runs out of
the trees, and the underground world of the family of the Kohlkopfs (cabbage heads).
</P>
<P>
The plot is designed (with the exception of the first and the last chapters) to be played
in any order. The plot is about soup, pot-herbs and a very ... impressive ... princess.
You won´t believe where you can find herbs and other interesting things.
</P>
<P>
The story is under construction and details of the showdown cannot be told here. Just
remember this: cabbage is not the only active vegetable in this game.
</P>
<P>
It has the look of a funny game, especially considering that there will be a film of the
same name too. Don't discount the possibility of an intro like Codename: Hellsquad in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The first demoversion is just one screen with no inventory.
You can´t do anything, but there is sound and it is worth a look.
</P>
<P>
I have CyberGraphX and so I just copied it over and played it (by clicking the funny
icon.)
</P>
<P>
It looks quite good! The screenshots don't do justice to the game, and it is funny. The
Hero stands there with a horse like in the Monty Python film &quot;Knights of the Coconut&quot;, in
front of him the obligatory toad.
</P>
<P>
When you move the mouse around the screen, the active objects appear as text on the
screen: the toad, the lake and the door.
</P>
<P>
Looks quite professional and has humorous touches. The hero, when he tries to open the
door, says: &quot;The door has no door-handle, damn demoversion&quot;. So how do you open the door?
That´s easy, use objects with the left mouse button (open, take etc. - the annoying
combining of verbs falls out) and with the right button you can look at them (strong door
made of imitation oak, as good as www.inutilis.de). I don´t know how to handle the
inventory, the second demoversion doesn´t help there, either.
</P>
<P>
The second demoversion is not as good, there are just two new screens. There is still no
inventory and the additional pictures are not as good as the first one. In the house,
there is a speaking shoe(!) that prattles all the time but you cannot choose answers nor
shut it up. And if you talk to it a second time it goes into the same rant as the first
time. On the second screen is the Titanic(!!) and the plot goes surreal. A second
speaking shoe appears, which just curses and obviously doesn´t like the first shoe.
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of ads for Inutilis (Latin for useless) products. This is normal even
usual in LucasArt but the number of them in this game is annoying. This is not to say
that the game is not good: on the contrary, this is just a phase in the development of
the engine and one can see the potential of the game. Let us hope that the quality of the
game overcomes the silly story.
</P>
<P>
The developer and storywriter is working hard on the game but it could take several
months.
</P>
<P>
There will definitely be no AGA version - at this high resolution it´ll be too slow - but
it will run under P96. We await a third demoversion, maybe with some inventory or sound?
By the way, a complete CD soundtrack is planned, too.
</P>
<P>
So, have a look at the demoversions for yourself and get ready for the full version.
