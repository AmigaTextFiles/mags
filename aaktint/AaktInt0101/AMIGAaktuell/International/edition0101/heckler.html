<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>Yea yeah year, 2001 already?</B></P>
<P>
I'm sitting, quite relaxed, at the round dining-room table of my alternate and holiday
residence in Gera. The illustrious local phone company technician only today hooked up my
ISDN connection, and my &quot;girl friend&quot; now is connected to the fast comm-strap.
</P>
<P>
Mobile phones: I have steadfastly refused until now. Maybe only  because I had not been
&quot;lucky&quot; enough to be among those who found one under the Christmas tree? Or a bit of envy
prejudicing me agin the mobile-phone-promotion hubbub in the media? Well, who knows...
maybe so.
</P>
<P>
Just how many means of communication does a man need to be happy? Good question ... Next
question: which means of communication does a man need to be happy? Not easy to answer,
either.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I bother my head more about the technical components than what I have to say? All
right then ... wrong start. Let's try it like this: When did I have my last really
absorbing conversation? And what was it about?
</P>
<P>
Offhand, I remember little or nothing. What did I murmur to the cute sales maiden in the
bakery shop this morning? Did I, besides a sleepy &quot;G'morning&quot; and &quot;Four pretzels,
please&quot;, say anything?
</P>
<P>
OKay, let's step back in time. Last night I watched TV. Ooops, the telly is a monologue.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon I had been in the city. It was quite overcrowded. I had to buy myself an
ISDN-suitable phone set - after all I may have had an emergency the next day. I do
remember a quite exuberant fussily-motivated salesman. Somehow he reminded me of the oaf
in the Telekom advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The height of his product appraisal was the following hint: &quot;Well, you know, you must
have ISDN nowadays&quot;. Of course I asked  if he had such a modern connection, and he had to
climb down: &quot;But I have a mobile phone ... hihihi-gnatz-titter ... may I draw your
attention to ... , too?&quot; I gracefully declined.
</P>
<P>
Mmmhh, oh well. I'm beginning to see that this kind of problem analysis is not very
fruitful. I reach over to my newly acquired phone to call a friend: &quot;Hi Ralf, how nice of
you to call me. How are you? <trilllll> Oh, wait a minute, my cell phone is ringing. Or
better ... I'll call you back some time.&quot; So he wants to call me &quot;some time&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Okay, didn't work well. I try a lady colleague, who does not have my advantage of being
on vacation. A few days ago I had proudly sent her my three phone numbers (MSNs) via
eMail. She mails back the question &quot;And which one is for what?&quot; and I sat a bit startled
in front of my monitor screen, then weakly promised to find out!
</P>
<P>
So let's kill two birds with one stone. Little high for me and my number in the display
for her. Ha ha, ingenious! Well thought, well done and dialled ... the drowsy &quot;tuuuuuut
tuuuuuut tuuuuuut&quot; has a somehow relaxing effect upon me. After five or six rings I hang
up.
</P>
<P>
Two more attempts are as ineffective. Intent? Mmmhh, rather lots of work ...
</P>
<P>
Well, don't give up hope. &quot;Try another of the ladies. One of them lately had her birthday
and you haven't congratulated her yet&quot;. She answers.
</P>
<P>
Short felicitation through the wire, short &quot;status report&quot; about the first days of my
holidays and a few nice regards out of Gera; but she is quite busy and I get a prick of
conscience. Hence a quick end of the call with best wishes for Christmas and &quot;A good
start into the New Year&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Mmmh, this wasn't the right thing either. My last try I give to an acquaintance not too
far away from Gera. A hearty &quot;Hi ... how are you? This is really nice, to hear some news
of you again&quot;. The call takes about five minutes with the result that we met a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
It was a nice day, we had lots to talk about and for good-bye there was a cordial
embracement.
</P>
<P>
My net result: Modern communication electronics provides us with a variety of
possibilities. But, folks ... I wish that all of us, for the year 2001 and further, will
once again really talk to each other.
</P>
<P><B>Live long and prosper,</B></P>

P.S.: Many thanks for the kind reactions I received after both my last hecklings. Special
thanks go to Michael Christoph, who remembered a possible solution for my timing problem
mentioned in my heckling 11/00.
</P>
<P>
Now at least my Amiga knows exactly when to grow a summer or winter fur. Mayhap a
solution for other readers as well!
