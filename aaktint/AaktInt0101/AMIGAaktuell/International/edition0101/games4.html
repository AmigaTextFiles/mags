<H2>4. Review: &raquo;Simon the Sorcerer II&laquo;</H2>
<P><B>The wizard returns</B></P>
<P>
After seven years one of the most popular point and click adventures on the
Amiga resumes.
</P>
<P>
K&ouml;ln, WOA 2000, Saturday 3.00 pm: Simon II is offered for sale. After a
long wait the sequel &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; is available. The game is sold
in a DVD high gloss cover. Inside there is the CD and a printed(!)
handbook.
</P>
<P>
Seems to be professional, more investigation needed.
</P>
<P>
There have been some problems with Simon II: the negotiations for the
licence dragged on, and the programming was hard work. The Amiga version
is drawn from several source codes, mainly x68 Assembler DOS/Windows. But
in the end Paul Burkey (Foundation) and Peter Muholland have succeeded, and
thanks to them we have an Amiga version of this classic game.
</P>
<P>
To know what´s going on, take a dip in the handbook: &quot;Simon is a young boy
who is teleported to a strange land by accident. There he has to manage a
lot of adventures...etc and rescues several people etc and kills Sordid,
the evil wizard, who, what a surprise, wants revenge from the grave.&quot;
Simple enough plot, isn´t it? There are some jokes in the handbook like
the title of the section on sound: &quot;Make-this-damned-noise-low!-function&quot;,
or the last sentence: &quot;We hope you have a lot of fun playing this game, if
you own a legal copy of Simon. If not, we hope you will hate every damned
minute.&quot; That´s right.
</P>
<P>
Getting back to the storyline: The intro tells how Runt becomes an
apprentice of Sordid. With his help, Sordid tries to retrieve Simon to
return from the grave. Sordid sends a magical cupboard to Simon's
dimension which transports Simon back to his dimension. Unfortunately
Simon doesn´t land in Sordid's castle but in front of Calypso's shop (Simon
saved Calypso in the first part). Calypso tells him that he needs BedFull
to get back in his own dimension. Meanwhile Sordid sends out his monsters
to catch Simon. The game begins.
</P>
<P>
More and more games these days demand better hardware. PPC and 3D graphic
board are often obligatory, 64 MB RAM and a 4* CD-ROM is not enough. Not
so Simon II. You just need AGA, 68030 CPU, CD-ROM and AHI (on the CD) and
16 MB. This shouldn't be a problem, should it? But extra RAM and graphic
boards are supported. Installation is very easy, just click on the
installer icon. You should make a directory for the game that can take 180
MB of data. Unfortunately there is no option for a part-installation for
smaller harddrives, except starting Simon II directly from the CD.
</P>
<P>
So, now you know what the story is and if it´ll run on your computer. If
you are still interested in the game, read on: After starting the game an
AHI sound mode and a screen mode (320*200, 8 bit) must be selected. If you
do not select a screen mode, Simon II starts on the workbench! The game
starts with an animation in which we see how Runt changes to Sordid. The
graphics have, in my opinion, not changed. This isn´t a bad thing - the
graphics of the first part were very good. Eyes spoiled by Heretic II and
Earth 2140 will have to get used to the 320*200 screen but this is not
difficult due to the great graphics.
</P>
<P>
This first film sequence is quite funny, but what follows then is a big
laugh: the credits! The credits? Why should they be funny? As in the
first part there is another intro running in the background during the text
about the programmers. This intro shows Simon in conflict with a living
broom. See for yourself who wins. And then the game starts.
</P>
<P>
Simon lands with his cupboard in front of Calypso's wizard shop. In a
short sequence we learn what we have to do (if you don´t know it by now,
you haven´t read attentively so far...) The screen is split into two parts.
The bigger one is the playing-field: you see the landscape and can move
with the mouse. If you click the mouse button Simon moves to that point.
If this point is on the border of the screen or a path, our hero goes to
the next screen, in the house etc. The other screen is the &quot;brain&quot; of
Simon. Here you decide what he should do. There are eight pictures (in
the first part of the game there were just words, now international
symbols). For talking just click on the mouth and on the person Simon
should talk to. For investigating things click on the magnifying glass, to
take something, on the magnet. I think this should be clear. The handling
is a bit fussy, often there is just one possible action. But it becomes
familiar and anyone who played the first part won't be fazed. In the
middle is the inventory where anything Simon finds on his journey is shown.
These things can be investigated, used or given away. In the beginning we
just have a post card, saving, loading and quitting. One can save at any
time during the game. Although you cannot &quot;die&quot; it is important to save
now and then.
</P>
<P>
You have to solve riddles by collecting things for use in the right place,
and by talking to people. Most of the time there are three sentences from
which you can choose. Because of the large number of characters (some old
friends return from the first part) and many locations, Simon II is a big
game. If you don´t know what to do in the game, there are some commercial
solutions but the game is not that difficult so you should get it on your
own. And you should have a sense of humour. You're searching for BedFull
to get wings for your cupboard and if you do nothing for long enough, Simon
becomes a little heap of bones.

Simon II is a great game. It is not as up to date as say, Nightlong, but
nearly every Amiga user can play it and it costs only about half. But
there are some niggles. There are bugs under OS 3.9, you cannot save the
game, the intro doesn´t run correctly all the time and you have to select
the AHI mode and screen mode all over again every time you start the game.
There is a bugfix for these problems.

Simon II is a well done sequel. It comes quite a long time after being
published for the PC, so the graphics are not up to date. But it is a
funny game just like the first part and it is worth playing - it will be
difficult to stop playing.
</P>

+ very complex<BR>
+ doesn´t need a high-end amiga<BR>
