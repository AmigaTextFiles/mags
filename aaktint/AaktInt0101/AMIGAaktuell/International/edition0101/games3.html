<LI> ACSYS is cancelled
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
After the developer team announced that they would only finish ACSYS if 500 punters had
expressed interest in the game only 86 did so. This is why the developers now have
stopped developing the game. The game will become open source - that means, if a
programmer or a programmer team wants to finish the game it may be published along with
profit sharing for the former team (exception: publishing as freeware).
