&raquo;A new update for owners of the &quot;The Best of Airsoft Softwair Gold Edition&quot;
CD-ROM was uploaded. Version 4.3 NG of the Install Kit supports much more
games now (177 in total). I also made some minor optimizations and bug
fixes. To download this update please use the program &quot;Updater&quot; which is
contained on the CD-ROM. This version of the CD32 Games Install Kit is only
available for owners of the CD-ROM. The last public, shareware version is
3.9.&laquo;

&raquo;I reworked the homepage today and removed a lot of unnecessary stuff like
the personal, projects, support and other sections. The homepage is now
much more compact and only really necessary things are available on it. I
also added a poll section which will contain a recent poll from time to
time. The links section was completely reworked and I removed all dead
links but I also added some new interesting ones. The only thing that
wasn't modified is the design, sorry. This will change also somewhere in
the future but certainly not in the near as I've some more important things
to do...well, feel free to drop me a line if you're an artist and want to
do something new for this homepage!&laquo;
