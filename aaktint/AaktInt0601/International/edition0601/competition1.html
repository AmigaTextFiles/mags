<H1>AMIGA aktuell International competition</H1>
<H2>1. Results of the last competition</H2>
<P>
First we have to make an unpleasant statement:
We don't have enough sponsors which are supporting our monthly competition. In the last
months, the will to support our competition was decreasing more and more. At the moment,
we are not able to realize a competition with a prize. The reason for that is undoubtly
the catastrophal situation on the Amiga-market and the complicated situation of
Amiga-Dealers and Software-Publishers. So, after some discussions, we decided to stop the
competition until we have again enough prizes. I and all other guys from AMIGA aktuell
are really sorry about that sad fact. Nevertheless, a competition without a prize does'nt
make any sence. We will reintroduce the competition, if we get at least prizes for 4
further editions of AMIGA aktuell.
</P>
<P>
For the time in between, you don't have to do without the master-question. We are always
interested in your opinion about the amiga-market and whatsoever is asked. In the next
edition of AMIGA aktuell International, you will find the master-question, in a little
changed form and of course without the chance to win a prize, in our forum. We will
publish the readers opinion in AMIGA aktuell International as like ever.
</P>
<P>
But now to current matters: In the last competition 30 readers entered.
</P>
<P><B>And now, last month's solutions:</B></P>

<P>
Several participants added comments to their answers to the question
of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Albin Konrad is pessimistic: &raquo;Because more and more I do not believe in a &quot;good&quot; future
for the Amiga, I will not participate in these changes. I deeply regret this, because I
have stayed with the Amiga from the very beginning. Still I am very content with this
system and will use it as long as possible.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Rene Stelljes thought of a &quot;fifth answer&quot;: &raquo;Out of the given answers I should favour
number 2. But personally I would take number 5:
5. Yes, if you can afford to buy a PPC board by then and if the new operating system does
not exceed the price of Windows.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Steffen Nitz wishes for an AmigaOS that remembers the past: &raquo;I hope for an AmigaOS 4 for
x86 processors with complete compatibility for software since 2.0.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Mai hopes that it will be possible to run AmigaOS 4.0 with PowerUp boards, too:
&raquo;I should like to buy the OS 4.0, but right now only if it will run on my current
hardware (PPC603e+ with 96 MB RAM, BVision). A completely new PPC board is too expensive
for me, and besides that I am skeptical this investment would pay off (too many
disappointments until now!!!).&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andre Beer has a similar view: &raquo;Presumably I will buy AmigaOS 4.0, if it will run on my
BlizzardPPC and will offer a real advantage (= increased speed). Otherwise I will keep on
waiting until an AmigaDE computer with AmigaOS 5.0 is available off-the-shelf.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Kai Stegemann has an eye on further development: &raquo;For the new OS the new hardware is the
first priority, then AMIGA may push the envelope some more. Furthermore the SDK must be
finished, before any software will appear for it. Then we can wait and see! Whatever
surprises the AMIGA-yanks have for us should not concern us plain users.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andreas Wolf rather trusts in AMIGA's competitors: &raquo;My expectations of AmigaOS 4.0 are
that, bundled with an Escena/Eyetech board, it must be more attractive than MorphOS +
Pegasos. This could become difficult once BPlan offers the more powerful hardware for a
(presumably) more favourable price. And I believe that they will have a finished product
in the stores before AMIGA Inc. + Eyetech.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Stephan Koehler bets on the AmigaDE: &raquo;My PPC board perished with Phase 5, and because we
cannot be sure that the new AOS 4.x will support those boards, I will not buy another
one, but save my money for the AmigaDE.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Hummel states his opinion extensively: &raquo;Amiga OS 4.0, PPC native ... just what
many users are looking for. Unfortunately again there are lots of other Amigans who do
not like this course ... It appears as if Amiga users have an unbelievable ability to
wait and see, after first going the grumble big time.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, AmigaDE would/will (the plans for the DE proceed anyhow!!!) be the ultimate
objective, but honestly, the Amiga OS, as we know it, brushed up AND PPC native, that
would be an exquisite thing! We will have to wait and see if AMIGA, Inc. can stick to
their schedule and, just as important, if the 3rd-party companies can bring out their
hardware platforms!
However it turns out, I hope finally to have new hardware and a new OS available, at the
latest by Christmas!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Bastian Kinne answers with &raquo;preferably 3, I do not plan to buy a PPC computer, unless the
price/performance ratio for such hardware convinces me - in this case OS 4.0 will belong
to it. :-)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Harry Fisch scarcely has hope: &raquo;Let's see if I can sell my Athlon during this summer ;-).
But I am very, very skeptical.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Claus Luethje wants to buy AmigaOS 4.0 in any case and in his opinion AMIGA did not
change course at all: &raquo;The so called 'strategical change' by AMIGA, Inc. is only a change
for those who did not understand the original strategy. (That now AmigaDE will not be
made a 100% OS, but that the existing AmigaOS will be adapted, really is quite
unimportant for the users.)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Runda will not buy a PowerPC system: &raquo;I preordered a G4 board from phase 5, and
I never got the board nor my advance-payment back. I do not intend to sink any more money
into this.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Krister Skrtic wrote: &raquo;I believe in OS4, not that the first version is going to be that
blasting but that they will continue making it better and it's PPC :) And new Rom's
taking away the 4gb barrier and other things. 4.2 would be really good.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Net result:</B></P>
<P>
A clear majority of participants want to buy the AmigaOS 4.0, as long as it conforms with
their expectations. Those who do not want to buy the update of the operating system
specifically criticize the selection of the PPC processor.
</P>
<P>
It was striking that it was mainly the critics who came forward with their comments.
</P>
