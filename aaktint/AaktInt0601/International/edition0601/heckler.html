<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P><B>Making waves</B></P>
<P>
Who would not be once in his life formidably famous? And even if only for a few jiffies?
</P>
<P>
An announcer for the &quot;Landeswelle Th&uuml;ringen&quot; [Local radio station in Thuringia] right now
has terrible difficulties. The manager of the station, so he complains in heart-breaking
tones several times a day, will fire him, if he has not become famous by the 30th of
June. Devoted listeners are asked to forward ideas for a truly bombastic action, which
will make him (and of course the station) famous everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Well, at least he's managed to get into AMIGA aktuell (International) courtesy of the
&quot;The Heckler&quot;. Cordial congratulations, J&ouml;rn!!
</P>
<P>
AMIGA seems to have similar problems. Unflaggingly they announce so called &quot;strategic
partnerships&quot; at regular intervals. No matter what the deal is, how small or big the
cooperation may be! It restocks the pages of print and online media of the Amiga sector.
The toilet seat with cable-TV connection, forecast by me, soon could become realizable
... (at last!!)
</P>
<P>
Greasy mutual admiration among the partners dominates two-thirds of these press releases.
To finish, they congratulate each other just like those property developers who lavish
the hyperbole on the houses they have built, awarding heavy-handed pats to their own
backs. &quot;Well done!!&quot;
</P>
<P>
Yeah, if praise is a bit slow coming from the media and the users-community (&quot;You are the
best (and only) Amiga-Community, that ever was&quot;) for projects that are vapor at best,
they quickly drop in another partnership announcement. And if a freethinker in the Amiga
scene dares think a bit too free, then certain rumors about a seizure start circulating.
Topped off again with an additional (not even planned at all) headline ... a whiff of
mystery to ensnare the old believers and the nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
During the last months some true innovation seems to have been coming from &quot;Outback&quot;
Germany. The MORPHOS team does not boast of doubtful partnerships with companies unknown
to us. They just jumped in and with (nearly) no ado sprinkled several beta versions of
the new PPC operating system among the global Amiga scene for testing. More and more
software is, as if by accident, ported to MORPHOS-native. The company bPlan, which was
founded by former Phase5 members, comes forward with the announcement of a new PPC based
hardware, to stir the stumps of a limping AmigaOS.
</P>
<P>
Just a reminder: Phase5 in days of yore was the enterprise that kept the Amiga market
alive; bPlan and Morphos now could become the alternative incubator of a fantastic
platform.
</P>
<P>
Eagerly we will keep watching and we wish our friends from the &quot;Landeswelle Th&uuml;ringen&quot;
full success in becoming &quot;famous&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosperous ...
</P>
<P><B>Yours</B></P>
