<H2>5. Amiga-Emulators on PC</H2>
<P>
During the last weeks there were increased requests how to play Amiga-games
on PC. Well, that works of course, but you need some thinks...
</P>
<P>
In advance: This article relates !only! to the legal use of Emulators. I
will not give any hints, where to get illegal Amiga-Games wether in mails
not in this article.
</P>
<P><B>At first wie need for having fun:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> WinUAE, a program that makes an Amiga out of a PC. There are some other
  emulators (Fellow, Amiga Forever), but WinUAE is the most famous and
  spreaded.
</LI>
<BR><LI> An Amiga with at least OS 2.x or an internet connection. The last is used
  to copy the operating system to the PC.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
That's all. Of course some people will say &quot;we need a game, too!&quot;. But that
can be get for free and legally. Therfore later.
</P>
<P>
Well, after downloading and installing WinUAE (e.x. at www.downloads.com),
we need a tool to save the amiga's os to a file. These tools are available
on aminet (de.aminet.net), for example &quot;GrabKick&quot; [and is supplied by
WinUAE itself in the drawer amiga/transfer, comment by translator].
</P>
<P>
That tools has to be started on the Amiga, it copies the AmigaOS [more
accurate: Kickstart, the amiga's basic operating system, comment by
translator] in a 512k sized file. To get this file to the PC there are
different ways. The easiest one is using the CrossDos-filesystem of OS 2.x,
that can read, write and format PC-disks. Just copy the file on a
pc-formatted disc.
</P>
<P>
Those who don't have OS 2.x (?) but an internet connection on PC and Amiga
can send the file via mail to themselves and get the mails via PC. There
are many ways :)
</P>
<P>
After copying the file to the PC, you have to run WinUAE. In the options
you may assemble your personal Amiga, that you want to use to play. At the
optin &quot;rom file&quot; you have to locate the copied rom-file.
</P>
<P>
Now you can start the emulation. That makes no sence at the moment, cause
you have no software yet ! Software can be get legally at
www.back2roots.org. There you can download many games, applications and
other amiga-related things. The files to be downloaded are so-called
ADF-files, amiga disk file. These files are an exact image of an amiga
disc. After downloading your favorite game, you have to enter the path and
name of the adf-file into the floppy-options of WinUAE. Now you have to
start the emulation and you can play on !
</P>
<P>
Well, that was it.
