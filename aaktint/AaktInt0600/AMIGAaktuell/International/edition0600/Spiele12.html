<P><B>Introduction:</B></P>
<P>
As you may derive from the game's name Rave Shuttle is not quite a normal
game. Infact it quickly turns out to be a "scene" game which is designed
for enthusiasts of techno beats.
</P>
<P><B>Game's description:</B></P>
<P>
If you don't consider the quite weird story - the player has to participate
in a mega party with the help of the futuristic techno space ship called
Rave shuttle - it's a graphics adventure in the style of Myst. Rendered
images represent the player's view. A click on a person or an item leads
to a logical action. You move using the help of mouse clicks as well and see
the transition or some scrolling to the next picture.
</P><P>
The graphics bear the first poornesses; the pictures look gloomy and cubic.
The parts which were not rendered but drawn by hand seem to be designed
without devotion.
The sound which probably is the ost important aspect of the game doesn't
please as well. The tracks running in the background are too monotonous and
too calm just like the scarcely inserted music videos - not what you'd
expect from &quot;rave&quot;. The full ingame speech of the mostly interesting
aliens is a nice extra but finally cannot please, either.
</P><P>
I don't want to say much about the game's fun factor. Instead, let me quote
the readme file:
</P><P>
&quot;The players task is to use things such as the battery of the small robot
Buggy, the cyber glasses, herbs, [...], water from a bucket and, of course,
holy ground of space and time at the right time and in the right room in order
to do good things and to spread happyness.&quot;
</P>
<P><B>Any questions?</B></P>
<P><B>Game's speed:</B></P>
<P>
If you passed the title screen (that may take more time than you might expect)
the game is pretty slow but still playable. If you don't have high expectations
then you'll be able to handle the game.
</P>
<P><B>Results:</B></P>
<P>
In my opinion the only reason for playing Rave Shuttle is that you can buy
it togehter with three other games in a bundle. Otherwise the game doesn't
offer continuous motivation to either fans of graphics adventures or to
techno lovers.
