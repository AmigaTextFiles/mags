Here now the official press release:
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;Press Release</B></P>
<P>
Amiga is Back, and will change computing forever, again.!
</P>
<P>
Amiga the creators of Multi-Media computing, have announced the release of
their developer kit for Amiga, Linux, and Java developers.
</P>
<P>
June 3, 2000 - Snoqualmie, WA - Amiga announces the release of the Amiga
Software Developers Kit, the first new product to introduce the next
generation Amiga platform.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga Software Developers Kit provides the initial tools and examples
for developers to create exciting multi-media content for multiple devices
and computing environments. The unique strength of the New Amiga comes
from the partnership with the Tao Group in Reading England providing a
foundation where developers are able to take advantage of a ubiquitous
computing environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Amiga established what is know today as multi-media.  As a result
of this, Amiga systems are used around the world by leading film studios,
animators, and in mission critical applications. Using this as the
foundation, the Amiga is moving forward by creating multi-media for
numerous devices and computing environments in the home, in the office and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga OS is capable of being self-hosted, and sitting on top of other
operating systems. A single application is capable of running on X86,
Power PC, M.core, ARM, StrongArm, MIPs, SH3/4, and others.  In a hosted
environment the new Amiga runs on versions of Linux, Windows 95,98/NT,
Windows CE, OS/9, QNX4, and others to be announced.
</P>
<P>
The new OS also embraces the Java language in a new, powerful and compliant
way. The intent Java Technology Edition from Tao is world renowned for its
speed and compact execution of Java applications. With the new
environment, developers will be able to take advantage of both Java, and
portable assembler coding.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Today we take the first step towards the future&quot; Said Bill McEwen
President/CEO of Amiga, Inc. &quot;The new Amiga SDK provides an environment
where the best developers in the world can build exciting applications,
that can transcend hardware limitations. Today Amiga developers can be
joined by Linux and Java developers in an environment that provides the
foundation for the delivery of future content.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;Tao has been talking for some time now about our developments to create
Digital Heaven® and we see Amiga and its community as a fundamental part
of the new order that can make it happen and take an industry lead. With
the sheer tenacity and the many qualities of McEwen and his Amiga team,
the world is going to see Amiga as a Premier Brand for connected digital
appliances,&quot; said Francis Charig Chairman of the Tao-Group.
For the developer, the new SDK creates a single environment that is
scalable from handheld devices, such as cell phones upwards New versions
of the kit later in the year will introduce many new media features. Both
the current and future versions will enable compact, high performance and
robust media solutions to be used across a broad range of devices using
identical binaries..
</P>
<P>
Fuer die Entwickler erzeugt das neue SDK eine einheitliche Umgebung, die
anpassungsfaehig ist von Handgeraeten, wie Handies (cell phones), an
aufwaerts.
</P>
<P>
Neue Versionen des Pakets, die spaeter im Jahr herauskommen, werden viele
neue Media-Eigenschaften einfuehren. Sowohl die derzeitige wie auch die
zukuenftigen Versionen ermoeglichen kompakte, sehr leistungsfaehige und
robuste Media-Loesungen, die mit gleichen Binaer-Codes in einem weiten
Bereich von Geraeten verwendet werden koennen.
</P>
<P>
The New Amiga SDK is available through local retailers for $ 99.00 (approx. 202.08 DEM / 103.13 Euros), and
from the Amiga web site, Amazon.com and other sources available soon. A
version via a Japanese distributor will be announced shortly.
