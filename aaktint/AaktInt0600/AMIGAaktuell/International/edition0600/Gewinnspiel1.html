<P>
Some participants commented the question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Rainer Traub answered with &quot;1 - Positive&quot;:
&raquo;I think, it is good, that the Amiga operating system is able to run also on x86 systems, because it will be spread
widely. Because nearly everyone uses a PC, and if it's from ALDI...&laquo; (Remark of the translator: ALDI is a big
German supermarket,)
</P>
<P>
Thomas Koelsch emphasizes, that you do not have to use a x86 processor: &raquo;I still don't like the x86, but due to the
fact that I don't have to use it, I don't care about it. The important thing is, that new users and developers are gotten.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Klaus Moddemann is for x86 and sees better chances for the AmigaNG due to the latest virus attacks: &raquo;I think, it is
positive, that the new OS will run on x86 hardware, because then Amiga will get more users. The latest virus attacks on
Windows system raise the chances for success, because who wants a system, which is the target of very many virus programmers?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Volker Grabbe thinks also positive about the support of x86 hardware: &raquo;AmigaNG on x86? Yes, the good availability
of components as the current motherboards and the support of the latest developments (DDR-RAM etc.) is the basis for
good systems. And you do not have to use Intel at all. Another good CPU producer (currently with better availability as Intel) is
AMD and especially in the Low-Cost range with their new DURON-CPUs they are the first choice. Another chipset manufacturer
is the company VIA, which is also an Intel competitor, who also has an own CPU (Cyrix III), but this is not on the same
(high) level like the Duron or the Intel Celeron.
</P>
<P>
And you can get your additional hardware in the shop around the corner!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andr&eacute; Koehler has not made his decision, yet, because he thinks, that the advantages (x86 is widely spread) and the
disadvantages (BIOS - hard disk recognition, etc.) are equal.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg means:&laquo;10 years ago, when a computer friend of mine was a PC fanatic, I told him, that I would accept
a PC, if its operating system was similar to AmigaOS. And this opinion became stronger when Windows came up.
</P>
<P>
It is not the processor, that makes the PC an unhandy device, but the misshapen Windows operating system. Up to Windows
3.1 you could do something yourself, even if it needed more than 10 Mbytes to run. But if I see Win95 loading
tenths of MBs from a CD, because his computer does not want to work anymore, after my friend inserted a
&quot;Plug 'n' Play&quot; sound card, this is not my opinion of a useable system. There were much more examples I could
mention, but &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; was only possible, because MicroSoft built the possibility to access the computer
in their Internet programs!
The x86 processor actually have power. The custom chips, which brought the Amiga the formerly unique abilities, are
fine on graphic and sound boards. And a lean AmigaNG operating system, will profit from the speed of the processors,
which are sped up to make Windows95 possible at all.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Fritz Trampnau dreams of a &quot;68200-Amiga&quot;: &raquo;Well, what shall one do? The &quot;Wintel-processor&quot;
is one of the cheapest and it is fast, but it is no AMIGA. That what really bothers me is, that the new &quot;AMIGAs&quot;
will run in a &quot;DOS-box&quot;! (shudder) I would prefer a real &quot;68000&quot; (e.g. 68200 with 800 MHz) - but it
does not exist. As you know the 68060 was the last one. Lamentation makes no use - well, let's see, what's to come!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Daniel Pisanec writes: &raquo;I think it is quite &quot;positive&quot;, that the new AmigaOS will also run on x86 systems
for one easy and good reason:
So the Amiga would address MUCH MORE people. So we get more buyers, who would not need to buy expensive hardware.
</P>
<P>
In other words: Amiga will have more success a x86 port!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Tacke has not made up his mind, yet: &raquo;The ability to run on x86 processors that's an affair. Amiga will not
produce hardware themselves. But if a third party developer decides to build a desktop computer on non-x86-base you really
have to explain the people, that it can compete with the cheaper x86 systems. That is not that easy. But on the other hand
the ability to run on x86 means a big potential customer base in the desktop market.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Holger Biehl thinks positive about it: &raquo;For most of the current Amiga users other processor families than the x86
series, but the x86 might be the only chance to quickly get new users and developers (because no one would by a new
computer, on which there is nearly no software (yet) than the operating system).
</P>
<P>
But due to the fact, that the system is non-proprietary (due to its virtual processor), everybody can use the processor
he likes.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Jean Holzammer criticizes:&raquo;Just two choices for the master question? I think, that the ability to run on x86 has
has neither very positive nor very negative consequences on the success/flop of the product.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Dieter Klingschat says it in one sentence: &raquo;I think, that there is more power in the x86 hardware platform than the
aged and overloaded WINDOWS gets out! (evidence: BeOS)!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Aichinger has a good reason for his affirmation: &raquo;I like that. Then the poor PC-users get a real operating
system ;).&laquo;
</P>
<P>
It seems, that Thomas Mitzschke found the question not that interesting, because his statement is about another theme:
&raquo;I think, that the AMIGA community has been very reserved about new announcements, in the last time.
</P>
<P>
The reason might be, that the announcements of the last time, especially in the hardware sector, have silently disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Also the kind how to market new products - first the money and then it might be produced, is not my kind. If this company
goes into bankruptcy, the money is gone.
</P>
<P>
I decided, not to invest much money into my current system, but to invest it into a new AMIGA hardware system.&laquo;
</P>
<br>
<P><B>Result:</B></P>
<P>
The result is clear: A large number agrees to the support of the x86 processor series. Most think, that the wide spreading
of this CPU is an advantage.
</P>
<P>
Actually, there is partially criticism, but the often expected &quot;x86-hating&quot; seems not exist under the Amiga users.
</P>
