<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P>
<B>Hello, dear reader!</B>
</P><P>
In front of you is the games section of AMIGA aktuell International of June anno domini 2000. Nothing special
happened this month, except the tumult about Alive Mediasoft, which can be ended quickly by the company, if they
make their position clear. This month, I also found it very interesting, that there are products to buy from the
(German) Weltbild group (e.g. products from Haage&amp;Partner are offered in the Weltbild catalogue). Epic Marketing
also offer e.g. their Amiga classiX 2 CD-ROM by Weltbild. I can hardly await the response on this campaign, which has
been unique for years.
</P><P>
Back to the games section: This month you can find two reviews in the about the shareware game Sharks!, which recently
was exclusively released for the CD&sup3;&sup2;. One review was written by me, the other one was written by the
CD&sup3;&sup2; alliance, which formed some time ago. In addition to that, there is the Mac corner of Andreas Koch,
as it is in any month. Using this opportunity I would like to praise Andreas for the continuity he makes the Mac corner.
While other sections are cancelled from time to time as the PD reports from the Aminet, the Mac corner was always there.
Actually there was a preview of the game JumpingAround planned, but unfortunately it always crashed on my system.
</P><P>
Now, I want to say some words about the preface of last month: I don't think, that there are so few readers because of
AMIGA aktuell (International) or the games section being not interesting, but the game market for Amiga became that
uninteresting in the last year, that it nearly does not make sense reading about it. And most of the games being released
(exept the games from 1 to 2 companies) are of little value. And who wants to read about games, that will not be released,
each month? Well, I got three eMails this month (including the one of Carsten Schroeder) about this theme. This is also
a pro for my opinion, that the number of readers is approx. 20. But I don not want to step on someones' foot and do not
want to create a mood of mourning. Maybe the situation changes for better!
</P><P>
Now, have much fun while reading!
</P><P>
<B>Yours,</B>
