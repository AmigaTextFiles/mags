<H2>2. Comparison: Chat programs - AmIRC vs. BlackIRC (by Numen Stahl)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;For the Amiga, there exist two IRC clients, the very advanced AmIRC (current version: 3.4) 
from Vapor and the also quite good, and most of all now freely available BlackIRC (v1.1). 
To say it beforehand: When it comes to features and overview, BlackIRC can't really keep 
up with AmIRC, but on the other hand, it is Freeware while the commercial competitor costs 
40 DM.
</P>
<H3> Let's begin...</H3>
<P>
After downloading BlackIRC (a quite small archive of 500kb) you can easily unpack and 
install it with the Amiga installer. The program supports/requires some additional MUI 
custom classes, which are listed in the (quite short) documentation and can be found in 
Aminet. Since BlackIRC is Freeware now, there no longer support for it - if you have 
problems, you don't need to mail the author, it is unlikely that you will get an answer. 
Further development has been stopped due to lack of time.
</P>
<P>
AmIRC needs a little more installation, because you have to get the 30 minute demo and 
the Update to version 3.4 (if not already in the first archive) from Vapors homepage, 
before you can add the keyfile, which of course has to be ordered first. (40 DM). But 
once installed, it also runs without problems and you will get, just like BlackIRC, to
</P>
<H3> The server selection</H3>
<P>
Here you can enter different IRC servers and choose which one you want to visit today. 
Furthermore, you can enter such elementary things like nickname, real name and user name. 
This is almost identical with both client as this screenshot shows.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Serverauswahl.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Serverauswahl.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
AmIRC offers a few more functions than BlackIRC (like the creation of groups, which 
helps to keep the overview). Insofar it can score a few extra points... but not many.
</P>
<H3> Features</H3>
<P>
Both clients have extensive preferences to make them very configurable. BlackIRC has 
beside the basic IRC options (like user observation, ignore, CTCP flood protection, 
auto-rejoin etc.) also options for video conferencing. Of course this requires special 
hardware and will not be used by many, but is nevertheless worth mentioning, because 
AmIRC does offer this. Furthermore, you can define some buttons with certain IRC 
commands like Kick, Ban, etc. You can also define aliases and log sessions automatically 
or manually.
</P>
<P>
But AmIRC easily tops that. You can really say that AmIRC can do everything that 
BlackIRC (except video conferencing) and a lot more. Besides the features described 
for BlackIRC you can also define fonts and colors for the several chat windows, put 
often used sentences on the F-keys and adjust almost everything you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
Both clients support ARexx, so you can easily use scripts. You can find a quite large 
collection in Aminet, so you don't have to program everything yourself. You will find 
not as much scripts for BlackIRC as for AmIRC, because the latter is more wide-spread.
</P>
<H3> Overview</H3>
<P>
If you chat on different servers, in several channels, have some queries open and maybe 
even some other programs running, overview is essential. That's were BlackIRC is losing 
ground: All channels end up in the same window, and you can switch between them with a 
mouse click. This one windowed mode isn't necessarily a bad thing, but BlackIRC doesn't 
notify you (neither acoustically nor optically) when something happens in a currently 
hidden channel. Furthermore the mode isn't available for queries, so have to keep a 
window open for each query.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/BlackIRC.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/BlackIRC.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="48" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
AmIRC on the other hand allows as many windows as you like, has a window list where you 
can open and close channels and queries, or alternatively a one windowed mode like 
BlackIRC. Even a mixture of both is possible, you can use only one window and remove 
channels or queries from it and run them in separate windows. The overview in AmIRC 
does not only beat its Amiga competitor, but also most common PC clients (like mIRC, 
HTIRC, pirch) as well. Here it scores a lot of extra points.

<H3> Results</H3>
<P>
Without doubt, AmIRC is the better program. I can really recommend it to every regular 
chatter. If you only chat now and then, you can save the 40 DM for the keyfile and use 
the 30 minute demo or BlackIRC. But is apparent that both Amiga clients can easily 
prove themselves against most of their PC competitors. If ever took a look at the most 
common IRC client for Windows, mIRC, you will understand why most users of this system 
prefer HTML chats...

<H3> Where to get it??</H3>
<P>
You can download BlackIRC for free from <A HREF="http://www.innovative-web.de/" TARGET="_top">http://www.innovative-web.de/</A>.

A demo version of AmIRC, which quits after 30 minutes and expires after 30 days, can be 
found on the Vapor homepage (<A HREF="http://www.vapor.co.uk" TARGET="_top">http://www.vapor.co.uk</A>).
This demo version also includes 
informations on how to obtain the keyfile for 40 DM (approx. 20.41 Euros) via email or postage.
</P>
<P>
Finally I'd like to invite every IRC chatter to the channels #Amiga or #Amigafun on 
irc.germany.net, that's were I can be found often (usually with the nick &quot;Numen&quot;; 
everyday about 21.00 (MET)). Maybe we'll meet sometimes! :)
