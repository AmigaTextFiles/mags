<LI> In matters of our own I want to direct your attention to a <A HREF="Umfrage.html">survey</A>, which is very important for the future of this
magazine and which is included in this edition of AMIGA aktuell International. I ask ALL of you to have some minutes
and to participate. Thank you.

the German version of this magazine, won far ahead of all other German magazines. The results can be read (in German only)

<BR><LI> Phase 5 digital products, who went into bankruptcy, seem still to send signs of life: Gerald Carda, formerly

Dietrich - according to rumours he is fleeing in Great Britain...
