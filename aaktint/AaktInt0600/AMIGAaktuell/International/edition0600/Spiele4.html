<LI> Important AMIGA-aktuell-International survey
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In matters of our own I want to direct your attention to a <A HREF="Umfrage.html">survey</A>, which is very important for the future of this
magazine and which is included in this edition of AMIGA aktuell International. I ask ALL of you to have some minutes
and to participate. Thank you.

<LI> Alive Mediasoft in cross fire
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
This month, the tumult about Alive Mediasoft escalated: While the rumours substained, that Alive Mediasoft published
old Amiga games without licence, an Amiga user found a cracker intro of Quartex on the Goal 2000 CD-ROM, who cracked
the game Goal in 1993. So Goal 2000 seems not just to be the old Goal, but a cracked Goal, which might also not be
licenced. First consequences took part: E.g. KDH Datentechnik has cancelled publications of Alive Mediasoft games,
until further notice. Alive Mediasoft has not commented the situation. If this is not done soon, the faith into
this company might be gone.
</P>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="3" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="CCCCCC">
<TR><TD>
Supplement: Meanwhile Alive Mediasoft distributed a press release, in which Steven Flowers spoke about his lack of
understanding of the Amiga community. About the bone of contention Goal 2000 he writes, that it is an old, not yet
released Goal version and that there existed only a version with cracker intro. But this is a complete mystery to me.
In addition to that he said, that the German retailer GTI had no idea about the quality of Alive Mediasoft products.
<P>
Furthermore Darkage software terminated the contract with Alive Mediasoft about distributing their programm
&quot;Extreme - The Visual FX Generator&quot;, because the have not been paid. After asking Steven Flowers a few times,
he said, that he could not pay Darkage, if he did not get the money from other retailers. Now, Extreme is distributed
by Epic Marketing.
</P>
<P>
In addition Amiga Network News released a message from Steven Flowers, in which he wrote, that Alive Mediasoft will be
closed, soon.

According to clickBOOM Nightlong starts its last testing phase, now. A release of the game can be expected within this
month. The port of Z is approx. 50% complete, but it is in good progress. The problem with Z is, that it is completely
written in x86 assembler.

<P>
Sharks! is the first CD&sup3;&sup2; game since two years. Even if it is not a commercial publication, I think this
is interesting enough to take a closer look on this game. This is why you can read a <A HREF="Spiele6.html">review</A>
in this edition.

requires a full version of Heretic II, of course. Furthermore Hyperion Software announced, that they want to port the

During the last weeks there were some rumours about Simon the Sorcerer II. But it is not correct, that Simon the Sorcerer II
might be sold just 1000 times, nor that it is already being pressed. According to Epic Marketing they try to get it published
to the World of Alternatives show in Neuss, Germany.
