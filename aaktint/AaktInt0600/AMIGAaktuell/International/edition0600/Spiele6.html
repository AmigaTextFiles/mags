<P>
Some closer details about the speed...but you have to explain, what &quot;smooth&quot; means, of course. Because
&quot;smooth&quot; is subjective. In my opinion &quot;smooth&quot; means a FPS rate of at least 15 FPS or better
25 FPS *independent* of the current &quot;place&quot; in the game, so it's everywhere !!!
</P><P>
It should also be mentioned, that the game is limited on AGA on 320x256. AGA in HAM8 mode is just not fast enough to
get it done better than 320x256 (in 320x256 I get approx. 21 FPS, if I let the game run under AGA...
in a &quot;common&quot; scene...)
</P><P>
320x256 smooth in AAKTInt column => This references clearly the software renderer. On very fast PPCs (200 MHz 604e or faster)
400x300 is also very smooth. Some people find 640x480 smooth, too. (But I only have a 150 MHz board, so I don't make
640x480...)
</P><P>
The hardware renderer runs smooth in 400x300, on very fast systems also in 640x480. And I heard also people talking, who
meant, the hardware renderer ran smoothly in 800x600... everything is very subjective, if you say that a FPS rate is
smooth.
</P><P>
I have to mention, that the hardware renderer improves the average frame rate as well as the MINIMUM frame rate
(which is difficult to measure, but has an effect on the &quot;smooth feeling&quot;.) In addition to the the hardware
renderer looks much better.
</P><P>
It should also be mentioned, that 640x480 16 bit is at the maximum, what the Permedia 2 can do fine. For more the chip is
too slow. A modern graphics board could do miracles.
</P><P>
But as I said: what is &quot;smooth&quot; depends on the personal opinion. I play Heretic II in 400x300, even with a 150
MHz board (but 604e). In network mode I go on LowRes, so I have a small chance against my unbeatable, little brother
(he really is good in 3D shooters :) ).

<H3>Sharks! CD&sup3;&sup2; (by the Amiga CD&sup3;&sup2; Alliance)</H3>
<P>
The playing on the CD&sup3;&sup2; continues...!!!
...because Christian Steiner puts a new CD&sup3;&sup2; game named &quot;Sharks!&quot; on the market. But there is one
thing more to say: &quot;Sharks!&quot; is the first CD&sup3;&sup2; game in 2000. [Remark of the newsroom: By the way,
Sharks! is also the only CD&sup3;&sup2; game since mid 1997]
</P><P><B>THE PRESENTATION:</B></P>
<P>
Just put the CD into the drive of the CD&sup3;&sup2; and it begins. After a short time of booting a menu appears
where you can choose between the game &quot;Sharks!&quot; itself and two other games, which were pressed on the
CD as a bon-bon.
Now, a small intro-animation starts, which shows e.g. who programmed Sharks! and who helped. After this intro is over
you enter a new menu. There you can choose between the options and the manual of Sharks! in English and German. Of
course, you can directly enter the game by pressing the red button.
</P><P>
By pressing the blue button on the CD&sup3;&sup2; on the joypad you enter the option menu.
First, there are the so-called &quot;FPS&quot; values, which you can optimize resp. change for use with a normal
CD&sup3;&sup2; or an accelerated CD&sup3;&sup2;(with SX&sup3;&sup2; module).
In addition to that it is possible to change the degree of difficulty. There are three settings you can choose from.
Those, who want to play Sharks! in AGA mode, should select this option menu, first, because Sharks! standard setting
is CDTV mode.
There are three more settings to choose from:
</P><P><B>THE GAMEPLAY:</B></P>
<P>
As a diver you have to try to collect treasures (diamonds, coins, jewels etc.) from the bottom of the sea. But be
warned, there are hungry sharks everywhere - and you don't want to become there lunch, do you?
After you collected the treasures, you have to try to bring them to your ship. In addition to you and the sharks there
are many fishes of various species. You do not have to be afraid of them, but the electric eel, because he can give
electric shocks to the diver.
There are nice animated air bubbles, which raise to the surface of the sea.
</P><P>
Alltogether there are 3 divers, who help you to bring the treasures from the bottom of the sea to your ship. Keep in
mind, that you get points for each treasure, which help you to get the top position of the highscore list. However, you
have to collect any treasure to get into the next level.
</P><P>
But despite all you courage, it becomes more difficult from level to level, because the sharks become hungrier and more
aggressive. So, do not come close to them, because they will hunt you.

</P><P><B>CONCLUSION:</B></P>
<P>
Playing &quot;Sharks!&quot; with the CD&sup3;&sup2; is real fun, even if &quot;Sharks!&quot; is a shareware game and
has their quality. The music tracks, which were written by Matthias F. Kretzler do not disturb at any time and are
important for the fun of the game.
Christian Steiner made us sit various hours in front of the CD&sup3;&sup2;. Who once began playing &quot;Sharks!&quot;
cannot stop for the next weeks. It is seldom, that a PD game resp. shareware game makes a good impression as this one.
Es macht wirklich richtigen Spass &quot;Sharks!&quot; am CD&sup3;&sup2; zu spielen,
trotz das &quot;Sharks!&quot; ein Sharewarespiel ist und dessen Niveu besitzt.
Die Musikstuecke die von Matthias F. Kretzler komponiert worden
sind, wirken zu keinem Zeitpunkt stoerend und tragen massstaeblich
zum Spielspass bei.
