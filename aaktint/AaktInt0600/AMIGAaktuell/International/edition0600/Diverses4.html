&raquo;Caution! Epic UK (not Epic Germany!!) has not been gotten anything from us for approx. half a year and does not get
any software of ours from any dealers. So Epic UK is not able to get software from APC&amp;TCP the legal way. Eventual
stocks, Epic could have (what is impossible after this period of time) are not paid and not property of Epic UK.
</P>
<P>
We ask all users not to buy software from Epic UK! In England, our software is available in any shop by GTI. In addition
you find a (not complete) list of dealers, who sell our software, on our homepage.
</P>
<P>
Users, who bought software of us from Epic UK are asked to contact APC&amp;TCP.
</P>
<P>
Please don't mix it up: Epic Germany has nothing to do with this. It is just Epic UK!!&laquo;

Welcome in the cupboard of your new Workbench. The new &quot;Digital Make-Up&quot;-CD is an add-on-CD with a load of
Tools and utilities for improving the design and tuning up the Amiga operating system and is arranged in themes.
Here you don't just find powerful tools, that speed up the AmigaOS and simplify the daily work - there is also graphics
material for the common gray Workbench. In addition there is software to make voice output possible. Of course, the desired
voice and sound samples are not missing. Many datatypes, latest libraries, modern fonts, new commands for the C-directory
and numerous other system enhancements put any Amiga system to the right course. New, nice screen savers and many icons
sets for the NewIcon system or the brand new GlowIcons get a modern outfit for the Workbench. Partially unreleased software
can be found on this CD-ROM. For the new AmigaOS revision 3.5 there is an extra directory where you find the latest tools
for the latest revision.
