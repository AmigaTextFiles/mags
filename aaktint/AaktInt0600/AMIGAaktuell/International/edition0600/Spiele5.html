<H2>5. Supplement to the Heretic II preview (by Steffen Haeuser)</H2>
<P>
Some closer details about the speed...but you have to explain, what &quot;smooth&quot; means, of course. Because
&quot;smooth&quot; is subjective. In my opinion &quot;smooth&quot; means a FPS rate of at least 15 FPS or better
25 FPS *independent* of the current &quot;place&quot; in the game, so it's everywhere !!!
</P><P>
It should also be mentioned, that the game is limited on AGA on 320x256. AGA in HAM8 mode is just not fast enough to
get it done better than 320x256 (in 320x256 I get approx. 21 FPS, if I let the game run under AGA...
in a &quot;common&quot; scene...)
</P><P>
320x256 smooth in AAKTInt column => This references clearly the software renderer. On very fast PPCs (200 MHz 604e or faster)
400x300 is also very smooth. Some people find 640x480 smooth, too. (But I only have a 150 MHz board, so I don't make
640x480...)
</P><P>
The hardware renderer runs smooth in 400x300, on very fast systems also in 640x480. And I heard also people talking, who
meant, the hardware renderer ran smoothly in 800x600... everything is very subjective, if you say that a FPS rate is
smooth.
</P><P>
I have to mention, that the hardware renderer improves the average frame rate as well as the MINIMUM frame rate
(which is difficult to measure, but has an effect on the &quot;smooth feeling&quot;.) In addition to the the hardware
renderer looks much better.
</P><P>
It should also be mentioned, that 640x480 16 bit is at the maximum, what the Permedia 2 can do fine. For more the chip is
too slow. A modern graphics board could do miracles.
</P><P>
But as I said: what is &quot;smooth&quot; depends on the personal opinion. I play Heretic II in 400x300, even with a 150
MHz board (but 604e). In network mode I go on LowRes, so I have a small chance against my unbeatable, little brother
(he really is good in 3D shooters :) ).
