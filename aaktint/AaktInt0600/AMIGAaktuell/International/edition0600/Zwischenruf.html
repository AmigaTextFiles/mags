He he he ........
</P>
<P>
When I was little, I could delight my family with my own &quot;J.R. Ewing&quot; laugh.
</P>
<P>
Even, if I did not understand completely, why you could delight grown ups with such a cheap joke (like smearing a creamy
cake into ones face) ... it always worked. Today, I am grown up myself and became a terrible cynic. What's the reason for
it? Mmmmhhh ..... I don't know.
</P>
<P>
Maybe, this is due to the fact, that I - as other people - quite often buy trash. The bread from the supermarket, which
went mouldly (and is shipped in a completely yellow packing to hide its content), the fine TV with 100 Gigahertz technology
and 1 MHz-digital-sound; lifespan punctualy 6 months, after that an easy copper bridge defects, which cannot hold the
grown demands of watching TV for 3 hours a day. Not to forget, the very expensive stereo, which became the disaster of
my poor, old neighbour (as reported in the last edition) ..... ;-)
</P>
<P>
But fortunately, there is our Amiga; valueable, firm girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Soon, she is supposed to get a new name: Ami (Fleecy used the name AMIE in the open mailing list of Amiga Inc.!)
</P>
<P>
This is not to point to the nationality of the new computer as one or the other might think, but means in plain English
girlfriend. So it's an americanized Amiga.
</P>
<P>
In addition they speak from AmiVerse. What the devil does that mean? Friendly universe? Well, at this point I don't mention
my knowledge of the English language; 'cos I want to survive the next week ...
</P>
<P>
But what does Amiga want to sell us? Well, after some weeks I am as bright as before: Something unbelievable powerful
(AmigaOS-New) is to lead us with its unbelievable friendlyness (AMI) into a new age (AmiVerse).
</P>
<P>
Powerful, powerful .... nearly as nice as the introduction of the potato in Europe, because it fought the hunger.
</P>
<P>
Until it is so far and I can my old Lady withdraws from active life, I have to fight much Volksmusik (folk music).
Because that easy as one or the other might think the whole revolution of Bill and Fleecy will not become that easy.
Too many trials of power fight on the computer market. The margins are increasing due to the partial shortage of
elements and the high value of the Dollar. And who wants to let this great opportunity pass? The shirt-sleeved makers
of Amiga will be fought with all power.
</P>
<P>
The only chance of Amiga Inc.: Quality
</P>
<P>
Only then, I might remain the only cynic with J.R.-laugh on this world (and don't imitate me!!) and kid poor, Volksmusik
loving senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Well, see you next month,
</P>

P.S. On this opportunity I want to direct your attention to an important thing. Even a cynic has a heart for poor souls.....
