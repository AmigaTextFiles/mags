<H2>3. Second new Executive Update from AMIGAs president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Executive Update: 6-3-2000</B></P>
<P><B>Hello world:</B></P>
<P>
Today is June 3, 2000, the six month anniversary of our first day of
operation as the proud new owners of Amiga.
</P>
<P>
When we got involved with Amiga, it was with the clear vision and goal that
we were going to change computing forever.
</P>
<P>
That we were going to be able to create an operating system that was
scalable and would run on different platforms and that hardware could
evolve as quickly as possible, and that Amiga would be able to take
advantage of that, and not be limited by it.
</P>
<P>
I wanted to create long term partnerships with our developers and OEMs
where we could truly be partners and not competitors.
That is being achieved by putting into practice logical, common sense
ideas, and working hard to succeed in achieving our goal.
</P>
<P>
After an interesting twisting of events, we are here and everything that is
mentioned above we have the chance to obtain.
</P>
<P>
Many of you did not think that we would make it this far :) , Suffice to
say we are going to be here for a long, long time.
It takes time to take over the world, we are planning to do it one customer
at a time, No, correct that, by adding one more member to the Amiga family
at a time.
</P>
<P>
Someone in the community felt that they had been slighted, and they took
their grievance out into the public forum.
</P>
<P>
Personally, I was feeling rather down because no matter what I said or did
it would not be reactive, instead of pro-active.
It was with this heavy attitude that I attended an impromptu meeting with a
group of visiting Japanese consumer electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
I had never met them before, but they had heard what we were doing, and
they remembered the Amiga fondly.
After our presentation, one of the gentlemen sat back, and informed me that
what he had just heard, and saw was the most exciting opportunity that he
had seen in years, and that we were absolutely the correct company for
them to work with.
What they had not told us until after that, was that these three gentlemen
were actually representing a group of over 50 consumer electronics
companies, and they were looking for a long term partner!
Let's just say that they liked what they saw, and heard.
</P>
<P>
I left that meeting with a new attitude, Never Give Up, and Never
Surrender.
wait,.... I think that someone else may have borrowed that.
Ok, how about, I will no longer accept that I must apologize for Amiga and
neither should any of you we do not need to apologize for being better.
</P>
<P>
Now we may not always do things that way, the way that &quot;others&quot; may think
that we should and we may not always get it right the first time, but we
are moving forward with our plans, and we will win !!
</P>
<P>
If you have friends that used to come to your user group meetings, call
them.
If you have an extra Amiga not in use, please, do let a friend try one for
the first time. If you know places in your community where you can shine,
then do so.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga changed computing forever with the introduction of the A1000.
</P>
<P>
We are about to do it again.
</P>
<P>
Today we announce the release of the first product since our acquisition,
the Amiga Software Developers Kit. This is the first step in creating the
content, and applications that are going to change the way people look at
computing.
As many of you are aware, what we are talking about goes well beyond
turning on a computer, and waiting, waiting, waiting, oh &quot; @%!%! &quot;,
restart, waiting, waiting, and then start our frustrating tasks.
</P>
<P>
No what we are talking about here, is creating a new and exciting computing
environment, where you turn on your machine and guess what?......its on.
</P>
<P>
The environment embraces the user, as opposed to the user being forced into
a certain method of doing things. And all the while we stay true to Amiga.
As I have been told many times before, Amiga just did it right.
Now we will continue that pledge to you.
</P>
<P>
Make no mistakes this product is truly for developers. This is not for
people looking for the next version of the Amiga.
This is a developers kit, that provides the tools, and starts developers on
their education of writing VP code and Java.
</P>
<P>
This is designed as a reference platform to get started, and there will be
more releases of the SDK over the coming months, as we add new features
and expand the AmiVerse.
</P>
<P>
In case you have not noticed, this is a change from the announcement in St.
Louis on April 1, 2000. We had originally planned to release a hardware and
software only solution, but we received so many comments, and emails, that
we listened to you and decided to take the time and launched a software
version of the developer release. Yes we listened.
</P>
<P>
We also have changed our plans on the hardware portion of the announcement
also. We had planned to be the sole source for the dev-box, but within
hours of the St. Louis show we have numerous companies coming forth saying
that they could build the developer boxes for less.
So again, we listened and changed our plans.
</P>
<P>
We have gone with a regional approach now, and are finalizing the list of
Amiga Dev-Box companies authorized to sell an approved system.
</P>
<P>
These will be local companies in each of your areas, and this should also
help with support and warranty concerns.
</P>
<P>
Fleecy has been hard at work and has written an excellent document that
offers a glimpse into the SDK and the way that developers will be able to
get the most out of it in a short time.
</P>
<P>
You can read it in Amiga World, or in the developers support area of the
site.
</P>
<P>
For those of you who think that we are sitting around, please note the
following:
</P>
<P>
Currently there are over a quarter of a million lines of code written for
the new version of Boopsi.
</P>
<P>
We call it BOOPS. It is in testing, and in the optimization stage and it
shall be ready for release very soon.
</P>
<P>
Also we are working very hard on a new scripting language, very similar to
AREXX, that we know that everyone will be able to enjoy.
Portions are in test, and there will be more about this development in the
coming weeks also.
</P>
<P>
Also I am pleased to announce that Dean Brown has accepted our offer, and
will joining us full time, and is preparing to move his family to the
&quot;great white north &quot;, another positive move.
</P>
<P>
We also have some other talented folks, but I am not at liberty to tell you
their names until after the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
We are also making a special announcement with some friends at Java One
next week, and I think that you will all be pleased to see and read more
about that then.
</P>
<P>
I am also very excited about the new AmigaTainment section of the web site
being introduced this week.
This is where you will be able to see works in progress on Amiga titles.
These are all products being developed for the new Amiga OS, and will be
ready almost as fast as we will be.
</P>
<P>
For the Amiga dealers who have responded, and are planning on stocking the
new SDK, you will find their list in the dealer section of the web site.
Please support them, as they have continued to support Amiga.
</P>
<P>
We took over Amiga on January 3rd, 2000, and six months later we have
delivered on our promise to you, a new developer platform.
</P>
<P>
There will be more announcements and partnerships, changes to the web site
and developer updates over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
I know that our silence can be extremely frustrating and there are those
people who will try and take advantage of our silence, but I do not want
us to pre-announce and build false hope and expectations.
</P>
<P>
There was far too much of that activity in the past and we can no longer
afford to pay for those sins of the past. Let us all move forward
together.
</P>
<P>
So my friends, today I am 38 years old. It is my birthday, and I could find
no better way to celebrate with you than this. Well, actually there are a
couple, but it does not involve Amiga.
</P>
<P>
I thank God for what we have accomplished so far, but this is truly only a
small glimpse of what it to come, we have set even greater goals.
</P>
<P><B>Sincerely,</B></P>
<P>
Bill McEwen and the Amiga team.
