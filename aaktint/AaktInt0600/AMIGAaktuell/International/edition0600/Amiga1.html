<H2>1. First new Executive Update from AMIGAs president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Executive Update May 30, 2000
<P><B>Friends:</B></P>
<P>
Many people have been writing to me recently, reminding me that there has
been very little activity as far as site updates go. While this is not
intended as the official Executive Update, I just want to make sure
everyone knew that there has, in fact, been a great deal of activity going
on at Amiga since the Amiga 2k show in Saint Louis a few months ago. As
usual, there are things that we aren't ready to discuss, but never mistake
our silence for being &quot;asleep&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Officially you can watch the <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_TOP">Amiga.com</A> site for the new Executive Update,
new developer and application information, as well as several other
updates which will be posted on June 3rd, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the next Update, you can expect to see much more information and details
about our immediate plans than this message will have. While we could have
waited another week or so to post the next Update, I thought the community
needed to hear from us, to let you know what we can at the moment, and to
ask you to be patient, just a little bit longer.
</P>
<P>
One critical area that needs to be addressed right now today is the Amiga
name, trademarks, logos, and intellectual properties. Many of you have
sent me notes asking us to take action against those who are making
illegal copies of our software, using our name without permission, and the
distributing our intellectual property without our knowledge and consent.
</P>
<P>
While this might seem negative for many, it is imperative that Amiga
properly and legally defend our trademarks and intellectual property. To
be blunt and to the point, if you are using the Amiga name, Amiga logos,
or distributing our intellectual property without a license, you must
cease and desist these actions immediately. Amiga Incorporated owns the
aforementioned items and all rights contained therein.
</P>
<P>
We understand that many of you have worked very hard to maintain a
community, the spirit, and all we know Amiga as today. Unfortunately,
there are many people, sites, and even companies out there who are using
the Amiga name in a detrimental fashion, and in negative ways. Some have
even sought to use the Amiga name to further their own goals and products.
Because of this and because international trademark laws mandate it, we
must make sure that anyone using our name, logos, or trademarks in any
fashion is properly licensed by us.
</P>
<P>
Okay, now that we've said that, here's the Amiga SDK (Software Developers'
Kit)!
</P>
<P>
On April 1st, 2000, at the Amiga 2k show, Amiga Inc. announced the
developer box and our partnership with the TAO group in England. To be
quite honest, the number of developers who approached us at the show and
shortly thereafter wanting to purchase the Software Development Kit (SDK)
separately from the hardware to run on your own machines took us
completely by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Well, we listened and in only a few days will be releasing to manufacture
the new Amiga SDK.
</P>
<P>
More information will be on the site the weekend of June 3rd.
</P>
<P>
Please note that the SDK will sell for $99 U.S. (approx. 202.08 DEM / 103.13 Euros). The SDK will be available
from your Amiga retailer, and other sources soon-to-be announced.
</P>
<P>
Things really are happening at Amiga, there are new applications, new
employees, new partnerships, and new products.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 truly is going to be a very exciting time. I look forward to
meeting with many of you over the coming months at the different trade
shows, different events, by phone, by fax, and by e-mail. I can promise
you that with the release of the SDK you'll begin to see Amiga get much
more aggressive and move much faster towards the future.
</P>
<P>
Thank you again for your continued support, and make sure to check the
Amiga.com site the weekend of June 3rd.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
Bill McEwen and the rest of the Amiga team.&laquo;<BR>
