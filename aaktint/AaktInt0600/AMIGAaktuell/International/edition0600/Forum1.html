<H2>1. Tips about problems with the AmigaOS 3.5 (by &quot;R-TEAM&quot;)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;After long and desperate searching I found several solutions concerning
OS3.5 bugs.
</P>
<P><H2>1. Problems with CD-FileSystem:</H2></P>
<P>
When suddenly CD-ROMs don't run any more (happened since OS3.5) and programs fail?!<BR>
(In my case Aminet-CDs, Trapped)<BR>
(in spite of beforehand e.g. CDFS beeing installed)<BR>
INEXPLICABLE ??
</P>
<P>
Well, nearly!
</P>
<P>
Discovered the &quot;BUG&quot; in OS 3,5 CD File System!<BR>
It is the OS 3.5 PrefEditor for the file system, it permits a minimum
value of 1 for DirectRead!<BR>
But normally it ought to be &quot;0&quot;! (According to CDFS original manual)<BR>
Having IDE-Fix, there the manual goes with it (at OS 3.5 the PrefE. is
explained nowhere!)<BR>
DirectRead sets the value the file system starts does not read via
the cache any more but directly from the CD!<BR>
With &quot;0&quot; this is automatically any request for reading bigger than the
cache (Roughly said).<BR>
Otherwise DirectRead states the amount in blocks (2KBytes), from which
reading starts directly. (1 = starting with 2KBytes (in fact any time!!))<BR>
It appeares, the the tools on Aminet CDs cannot cope with this and
Trapped neither!<BR>
Solution: With help of GoldED or another editor change in mount file the
value of MD to 0! Then everything will run ok.<BR>
The error appeares only, if SAVE is used in the PrefE.! (The default
settings of the installation are all right!) Because in this case
always value 1 is saved!
</P>
<P><H2>2. Problems with new FFS !</H2></P>
<P><H3>2.1 Problems with DS (DiskSpare-Device) V 3.3 :</H3></P>
<P>
For those not knowing DS :<BR>
It enables disks with capacities of 1.0/1.98 MB !<BR>
There never were problems earlier than FS 45.<BR>
The new FS does not permit any more the patching of DS device into FFS.<BR>
Without this the auto-detect of DD/HD disks is not possible !<BR>
(AmigaOS only permits variable device sizes to the trackdisk.device,
consequently DD + HD disks alternatively on DF0 e.g.)<BR>
Solution: None (The mount file needs to be configured either for DD or
for HD disks, a change is only possible after Diskmount)<BR>
</P>
<P><H3>2.2 Difficulties with Siedler :</H2></P>
<P>
I installed all my games on a Syquest. Because my WB runs on PFS I imagined,
that an extra partition might be more compatible especially with games.
This is, what I believed !<BR>
Since OS3.5 FFS (which I installed right away on the Syquest) Siedler is
not loaded any more from the removable disk (ONLY with FFS 45 (No problem
>from Syq)). Don't know, why?<BR>
Solution : Quite funny, you have to start the new SetPatch of OS3.5, this
has to load the OS3.5 workbench.library, the last statement of the
startup-sequence has to be the new OS3.5 LoadWB, this has to load the
workbench.library again, then you may start Siedler (as well from CLI),
with FFS 45, too (what may correlate the workbench.lib with FFS ??)
</P>
<P><H2>3. Problems with HD sleeper programs and OS3.5.</H2></P>
<P>
HD sleeper programs power down unused SCSI harddisks! (Immediately or
after some time of inactivity) This saves power (Oh well) and mainly
runtime of the harddisk (Any disk has wear and tear while running!) Only
disadvantage is, that the restart takes some time.<BR>
Now I discovered, that one of my HDs does not switch off, (it happens
since OS3.5), even when there was no access since a long time.
Solution : This happens, if the disk is set to &quot;Hidden&quot; in the WB-
PrefEditor. (It should not appear on the WB)<BR>
Otherwise the WB 3.5 accesses in regular intervalls just the hidden devices
(does this make sense ??) That means, the hiding of those devices has to be
disabled, that are on disks (units), which sleeper programs care for!
(To hide a volume, that it may not appear on the WB, but to be able to
to access it via CLI or DOpus: Example )
</P>

<CENTER>
Partition Name DH1:<BR>
Device Name     Daten:
</CENTER>
</P>
<P>
Set in the Startup-sequence (or User-startup) assign Daten: DISMOUNT !<BR>
(The volume Daten: is not to be seen any more and is not shown on the
WB, but you can access DH1 !)
