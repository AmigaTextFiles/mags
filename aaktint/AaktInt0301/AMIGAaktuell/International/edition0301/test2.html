<H2>2. Experience report: Love at third print: my new &raquo;CanonBJC-S400&laquo; (by Mathias Klingner)</H2>
<P>
For three years, I've been using a &quot;Canon BJC-4200&quot; printer. But because I print a lot
and in color, those way too small ink cartridges were sand in my serenity. I fill them
myself to save money, but it was difficult to determine the correct amount of ink when
refilling. All three colors are in a single unit and you cannot see how much ink is left
in each ink chamber.
</P>
<P>
I decided to buy a new printer for the new millennium: a discontinued model, the
BJC-6200, for just 300.- DM (150.- Euro) - it had a transparent ink cartridge for each
color.
</P>
<P>
I read on videotext that Canon would be introducing new printers in February, but I was
still after that discontinued model. I had even ordered a disk from Irseesoft with new
Turboprint drivers for the BJC-6200, 3000 etc. But of course..... no shop I went to had a
BJC-6200 in stock.
</P>
<P>
Then, on January 26th, when I visited the MediaMarkt (a big chain of electronics stores
in Germany - remark of translator), I found myself standing before a pallet of new
printers from Canon. I was a little surprised, since they weren't supposed to be there
until February. What got my attention was the price of the new BJC-S400: 250.- DM (125.-
Euro).
</P>
<P>
Striking up a conversation with the assistant, I was told that this model was the
successor to the BJC-3000. The successor of the BJC-6200 would be the BJC-S450 and would
cost 450.- DM (225.- Euro) when it arrived within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The BJC-S400 and BJC-3000, slot in below the more expensive BJC-S450 and BJC-6200, which
are faster at printing, and use a 6 color cartridge instead of a 4 color one. I don't
know how they differ apart from that. Since the Amiga will be the brake on both the
interface speed and the preparation of print data, the faster speed won't probably be an
issue anyway.
</P>
<P>
So I decided to go for the BJC-S400, even though I was wondering about drivers, as you
do. At home, I set it up with the included 24 page manual &quot;First steps&quot; and connected it
to the computer and mains. I already had the driver disk for Turboprint installed, which
I had received from Irseesoft.
</P>
<P>
Since the printer is similar to the BJC-3000, I tried that driver in Turboprint. I loaded
up a document in Finalwriter and sent it to the printer, but the progress bar didn't show
any progress. So I tried the driver for the BJC-6200, with no luck either.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately it wasn't very late in the evening, so I called Irseesoft and described my
problem. They told me that the drivers for the new BJC-printers were still a little
buggy. I said I had especially ordered this disk and paid 20.- DM (10.- Euro) in advance.
They asked if I had access to the Internet, to download the update to version 7.16 from
their site. This version would have the bugs fixed. Guess what, I had already had my son
do this, because I had read in &quot;AmigaPlus&quot; that you can now download updates for free and
should because ordering disks can take forever.
</P>
<P>
So I installed version 7.16 with the fixed driver. The installation was fully automated
and very fast. Once again, I fired up Finalwriter and tried to print. Same result as
before. Then it occurred to me to re-select the driver after un-selecting it: finally, I
was able to print, but only in black and white. I went to the Turboprint settings, where
I saw that the black cartridge was selected. After changing this to &quot;Color&quot;, my new
printer produced colored print-outs.
</P>
<P>
Since then, I have printed about 150 color pages in 360x360dpi mode (Drop emulation).
</P>
<P>
I am very pleased with the quality of the output, and it is a little faster then the
BJC-4200. I'm still using the cartridges supplied with the printer, and they are still
about 50% full. An original ink cartridge is about 20-22 DM (about 11 Euro) and an black
ink cartridge is 25.- DM (13 Euro). A new print head is priced at 120.- DM (60 Euro), but
I don't know if ink is included. For the BJC-4200, inks were included, and the head was
about 100.- DM (50 Euro).
</P>
<P>
The disk with the new drivers also contains a so-called BJC-Utility in the &quot;Extras&quot;
directory. Using this utility, you can clean the printhead (normal or intensive) and test
the printhead. It should work for these printers of the BJC-series: 1000, 2000, 4200,
4300, 4400, 6000, 7000  and 7100.
</P>
<P>
Besides the manual, the included CD-ROM also contains a 300-page-manual in PDF format.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to view it in APDF, even though APDF was working with other
documents. So I had to view on my son's PC :)
