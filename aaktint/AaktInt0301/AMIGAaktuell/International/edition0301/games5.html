<H2>5. New PD games</H2>
<P><B>Hi-ho, friends!</B></P>
<P>
Sometimes it really is funny how things go. In February there were catastrophes followed
by debacles: BSE gains ground, the CDU gets ditched again in the morass of contributions
and people apparently look like the plan of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
But unimpressed by all this there are the programmers. Because, even if tomorrow the
world goes to hell in a handcart, you can predict with complete certainty that in
February only half as many games will be released as in January.
</P>
<P>
Why that is, and why exactly half as many? Search me, I've not the slightest notion! But
don't let it bother us, this month there again was a top game, which gave the idea of
&quot;Freeware&quot; a commercial touch (paradoxical, no?).
</P>
<P><B>Time to test:</B></P>
<P><B>-Toadies</B></P>

</PRE>
<P>
By now there couldn't be a computer user who hasn't heard about Worms. And this is
reasonable, because that game is one of the most fun multiplayer games, in spite of
Counterstrike and Unreal. And therefore it is not surprising, that there are more than
just a few clones of this game, commercial as well as free of charge. A free
representative is Toadies.
</P>
<P>
Toadies is based squarely on the playing principles of Worms 1, but there is no computer
opponent. Instead there are quite a lot of new weapons as well as visual improvements.
All this is so successfully done that you will wonder why this game not has become a
commercial one.
</P>
<P>
Toadies is completely user-definable, everybody can rig up their own version, including
sounds, and there is even a level editor thrown in. There is a guide in the HTML doc on
how to create custom textures for levels. Get into it, inventive heads!
</P>
<P>
With such fine graphics, the gaming fun must not be neglected. And indeed it wasn't, the
control and the physical conversion of weapons has succeeded great to very great - only
deficiencies are the curious ballistic curves of the bazooka, whose trigger you only have
to caress and everything goes aboom, and the missing wind, too. But this was made up for
with the different types of gravity.
</P>
<P>
Everyone who does not get this game voluntarily will get a spank! From me!
Personally! Go and get it!

Personal overall impression of the editor: 9 out of 10 points
</P>

Well, so much for this month. Why not more? All right, there wasn't anything else worth
testing. But for the record, the following games appeared:

Ok, and upon request of a single person (*grin*) I thought of &quot;printing out&quot; the rating
scale.
</P>
<P>
So if at the total evaluation there is written this and that, it has to be interpreted as
such and so:
