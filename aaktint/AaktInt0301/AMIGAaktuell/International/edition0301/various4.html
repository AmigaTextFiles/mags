The first updates for AmigaOS 3.9</B><BR>
</P>
<P>
We've just uploaded the first updates for AmigaOS 3.9. Nearly all locale files have been
reworked and completed. The archive contains all locales necessary for 20 languages. The
new Genesis Prefs is finally completely based on ReAction; no need for MUI and its
classes any more to get it to run.

We nearly forgot to mention; at the beginning of the year Martin Steigerwald joined our
team. Many of you will already know him as the organizer of the 3.5 and 3.9 beta tests.
He is now responsible for the organisation and betatest of several of our projects.

German ImageFX 4.1 Manual &amp; Locale</B><BR>
</P>
<P>
Power user Gunnar Gertzen finalized the German translation of the original ImageFX manual
in addition to the locale files. The German manual comprises the original black main
manual as well as the addendum and so it has become a 400 page tome. This book also
contains a lot of hints on external programs that can work with ImageFX.

ArtEffect colorful</B><BR>
</P>
<P>
Have you ever wondered why ArtEffect's toolbar looks so drab? Then you'll certainly like
the new one that offers full 256 colors - and it also matches the product cover&laquo;
