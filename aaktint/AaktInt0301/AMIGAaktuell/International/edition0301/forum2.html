<H2>2. &raquo;AmigaOS 3.9 - really just a &quot;cheat package&quot;?&laquo; (by Wolfgang Hosemann)</H2>
<P>
I have read the two articles (so far) about os3.9 in &quot;Amiga Aktuell International&quot; and
was very surprised by the obvious nearsightedness displayed by &quot;experienced&quot; Amiga-users.
In one article the author disparaged 3.9 as an &quot;os3.5 + shareware-collection&quot; and claimed
other programs would have been much better than those that came with os3.9.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the author contradicts himself. The &quot;shareware-collection&quot; is interpreted as
an attempt to shortchange the customers while he wants other shareware-products
integrated in os3.9.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore I could not accept all the (technical) criticism. The OS3.9 is sold as an
operation system &quot;for all&quot;, not for specialists, who are smart enough to replace the
important functions with other (shareware) ones or just program them for their own needs.
In this light the criticism of &quot;PlayCD&quot; is in no way warrantable. And the author
obviously overlooked the new functions of &quot;PlayCD&quot;. Hasn't anyone noticed, that when it
is started, &quot;PlayCD&quot; immediately starts playing the inserted CD ? &quot;PlayCD&quot; searches for a
CDROM and uses it automatically. Oh, I forgot, this function is a standard one in other
players ;).
</P>
<P>
Seriously, in my opinion, there are too many comments made without a proper look at the
material (and particularly in the Amiga market). What a pity, as the Amiga market reacts
very sensitively to negative comments and criticism. This behaviour of by the Amiga
community has not been good for the market.
</P>
<P>
But to return to the topic: OS3.9 is definitely misjudged. It was a more than masterly
achievement to produce this system within such a very short time of development. It is
often overlooked that the shareware-programs that come with OS3.9 are different from the
versions found on the Aminet. One can assume that these programs have been extensively
reworked, since they were integrated into the OS3.9's beta-test. That's what J&uuml;rgen Haage
was on about at WOA 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sure, the errors in the production of the CD are regrettable, but they are pardonable.
Other operating systems have a much bigger development crew concentrating on the product.
H&amp;P as a company with its focus on the Amiga market has the same problems as any other
company that produces for the Amiga: there are not the resources to have a hundred or
more people working full time on further development and quality assurance with the
AmigaOS. Nevertheless I am sure that the errors of the CD can be corrected very easily
and maybe for free.
</P>
<P>
From this point of view, there is another peculiar characteristic of OS3.9: it is a
product that has been developed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, with very low financial
expectations. A question to all readers out there: Would YOU do that? Would you invest
work in something that earns little or no money? I bet 95% of all readers would pass on
that and do something more profitable.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless I want to do a full review to deal with the plentiful negative aspects (as
certain users claim). For my part I will also be looking at the positive aspects. I want
to illuminate OS3.9 for the average user:
</P>
<P>
Installation: If you've never had any IDE-toy-controller you've been on the safe side.
However, IDE-FIX (even the express-version) is now automatically detected and used while
making the emergency-disc (yes, they have learned from their mistakes! It's not a
feature, it's a bug! Would MS admit that ever?). But there are still problems with other
controllers. That is too bad, but there are technical reasons that mightn't be solved
easily. Look at the article in Amiga-Magazin &quot;Und es l&auml;uft doch! (But still it runs!)&quot; by
Martin Steigerwald, it can be found at the homepage of Amiga-Magazin.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that: insert, install, run! As an experiment, I upgraded my awfully jazzed up
A4000 (nearly completely equipped) to OS3.9 without creating an emergency-disc. Hear it
and be astonished: it booted immediately, faster than before and much more stable than
with OS3.1. Without the incompatible WarpGIF-datatype, EVERYTHING would have been fine
(AnimatedIcon didn't work for that. After installation of the standard GIF-datatype,
everything was fine). Best of all: the CD errors were not noticeable.
</P>
<P>
Multimedia-Programs: Amplifier as the MP3-player for OS3.9 instead of AmigaAMP becomes
understandable when you read the comments about OS3.9 by Thomas Wenzel (the author of
AmigaAMP). In his opinion, OS3.9 is unneeded and he doesn't want it. Anything else would
have been better, that's it! I don't know why he comes to this conclusion, as I have not
questioned him personally, but he'll have some reasons. In fact, Amiga has its official
(definitely not bad) MP3-player. It runs on my system a bit more stable than AmigaAMP and
makes a good image. If you like AmigaAMP you can use it under OS3.9 without any
limitations. OS3.9 does not set any conditions for replaying MP3s.
</P>
<P>
Selecting Moovid as AVI/QT-player was not a negative. Its plays very reliably and above
all FAST, even on lower systems. A missing PPC-version could be developed. The author has
to pay Intel's licence fees for the Indeo-Codec that is not part of the freeware-version.
With more registrations, there would maybe exist an PPC-version in OS3.9. Too bad, but
possible !
</P>
<P>
The MPEG-player: Seriously: does anyone have fun playing an MPEG-movie on a 68k-system? I
think not many. Think about the small number of PPC-owners: for them, no MPEG-player with
OS3.9. I can imagine that it would be hard work to convince authors of such a program to
integrate it into OS3.9. I'm thinking of M. Roslund who has released the only useable
MPEG-Player. Perhaps he did not want to (maybe nobody has asked him), but it's fact. If
there is anyone who declares he is willing to write a player, perhaps he should get in
touch with H&amp;P. Certainly, he won't become rich.
</P>
<P>
AmiDock: yes, it is just a start-bar and has not the features of ToolsDaemon, but it is
VERY solid in what it does do. It runs programs, opens directories, and directs files to
the programs within the dock. In my opinion, it seems to be written for users who don't
want to handle thousands of features that are far away from the intention of the program.
I used to work with AmiDock, daily. Finally, no configuration-orgy!
</P>
<P>
VincED: There is one other thing that disturbs me - again and again some people criticise
the coders of OS3.9 for having to rely on Aminet. They forget that these products are
PART of the new OS and will be included in every version that follows. If AmigaOS goes in
the direction of PPC, all the components will do so, too. This is what many PPC-User are
dreaming of (and most of the rest). In my opinion, that is a positive.
</P>
<P>
UnARC: On this point, criticism is justifiable. But who knows, perhaps there is a
PPC-version to follow ? Maybe there was no time left to create a PPC-version. If only it
was that easy: take the source and recompile it for WarpOS... that's unjustified
criticism - and a wider problem for writers about the Amiga: insufficient research. In my
opinion, everybody should think about this.
</P>
<P>
Contributions: What's the point of 'Contributions'? In general it means something like an
accessory. How does it fit into OS3.9 ? People wanted to contribute something for the OS,
profitably or not depends on the needs of the user. Looking at the accessories that come
with OS3.9, it is for those users, who do NOT have already everything. It is a pleasant
bonus, for example the big trailer in AVI-format that does not have to be downloaded
manually.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, these contributions puffed up the whole CD to its 470MB (sorry, I have to
laugh ;-)) ). Does this matter on a disk with 650MB of space? As the contributions have
370 MB, we can say the OS needs 100 MB, well? Can someone remember the amount of memory,
OS3.1 needed? Yes? Ok. That is what makes AmigaOS so enviable: the low amount of space it
needs.
</P>
<P>
So, where is the problem? Does anyone really want an OS that needs about 600MB space for
full installation? You can have it: just get Windows 2000 and have fun with it.
</P>
<P>
This point shows that many advanced users only think about their own needs. For some
coders, unfortunately, you can see this in their programs as well. Too bad, a little bit
more consideration for less experienced users would be an improvement for many programs.
For this reason I can not understand why nice contributions should not be integrated into
the OS.
</P>
<P>
I understand this criticism even less when I consider that some of the integrated
programs are not free on Aminet! I repeat: we have to think about the users who do not
yet have everything.
</P>
<P>
The purists: sometimes I get the feeling they are too &quot;pure&quot; in relation to their Amiga.
Ok, it is a reasonable criticism that the new def_icons need more RAM and can be a
problem with lower-spec systems with insufficient RAM-space. This is a real dilemma:
which systems should be supported by newer OS versions? Modern, upgraded systems, that
allow reasonable working with newer techniques like MP3 etc, or those non-AGA-systems
with a 68020/14 MHz-processor, out of date since 1992? Yes, GFX-cards for amiga are
rudely expensive, but memory is not (for the PC it costs the same).
</P>
<P>
Some patches that let Icons be moved into fast-ram collide with many older programs.
Sure, that is a problem, but not one to be solved with a newer OS-version, but with a new
program (for example DeluxePaint, really an oldtimer, and in no way written
OS-compliant).
</P>
<P>
For those users I have only one suggestion: get a little bit up to date. Buy a new
program (or use one from the freeware-section), buy a little bit more memory and the
programs are out of sight! Perhaps it is time to buy a new GFX-card, too? Then buy one!
As a nice side effect, that helps Amiga firms to stay alive. And that is what we all
want.
</P>
<P>
I hope this criticism of the criticism has helped to tackle the problem from the stance
of the user who is glad to be able to do things on the Amiga that were only possible on a
PC before, and without huge effort.
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, I stand by AmigaOS3.9 and will inspect coming versions carefully and buy them.
And not only to support the severely weakened Amiga market...

<P>
P.S.: Has anybody read the various articles about the BoingBag for OS3.9? I guess the
critics have not, otherwise they would never have suggested the OS3.9 to be a
marketing-trick, as the Update is for free.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the time in development for the improvements does not cost anything, either??
