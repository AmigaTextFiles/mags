<H2>1. Response to Achim Stegemann's comment concerning AmigaOS 3.9 (by Michael Christoph)</H2>
<P>
Genesis costs 98 DM for a single full version, the Aminet-programs are not
full versions ...
</P>
<P>
Me presses calculator buttons:<BR>
AminetCD 20,00 DM<BR>
Genesis  98,00 DM<BR>
</P>
<P>
Total 118 DM ! And you (Achim Stegemann) are turning up your nose, because it
costs you 89 DM all up and you get as a bonus track an Annex-title ?
</P>
<P>
Why various programs are integrated with the AmigaOS has been publicised by
Haage&amp;Partner many times. Go check!
It is not possible to copy any old program from the Aminet onto the AmigaOS
cd. The program's developer must cooperate with H&amp;P, to keep the
&quot;systemhacks&quot; compatible with the os. And source codes must be open, so that
H&amp;P can do bugfixes if needed. If programmers do this, there will be no
problems. But most programmers are chasing shareware cash!
</P>
<P>
AmigaInc might have come up empty four weeks before Christmas vis a vis the
Amiga family, but that's not H&amp;P's problem. Who could make a bugfree product
in such a short time? Let alone an MPEG-player, and with no finance from
AmigaInc!!
</P>
<P>
AmigaOS 3.9 is obviously no BoingBag2 (check it out, the latter is freely
available). No-one claimed otherwise. Messages to newsgroups should be taken
with a grain of salt!
</P>
<P>
There are good and bad things to say about AmigaOS 3.9, but just plugging the
bad is hardly being objective. AmigaOS 3.9 is not perfect, and of course
AmigaInc is not going to be objective either - it's up to you to decide just
how useful it is for the sorts of things that you want to do!
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg has already given his unqualified &quot;first impressions&quot; in
AmigaAktuell 01/2001. No doubt he is continuing to work with the os, and will
report any other problems/goodies he finds with it.
</P>
<P>
My personal view: I've been a beta tester since AmigaOS 3.5 and have watched
the many tweaks that have been done deep in the heart of the os, many of
which are not obvious from the outside.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all that, I believe PPC-AmigaOSes are not required and don't help
the AmigaDE. Not only will it take a (wasted as far as I can see) year for
development, but there could still be compatibility problems with the classic
os. Compatibility would be better suited to an emulator as far as speed is
concerned, freeing up time for much-needed improvement and corrections that
will benefit everyone and not just a small group of classic users.
