<P>
Several participants added comments to their answers to the question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Karl-Heinz Bader answers the question, whether he will visit the CeBIT in a, well, let me
call it quite interesting, way: &raquo;Probably not. But maybe after all yes? :))&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Krister S. Skrtic answers &quot;No&quot; and states: &raquo;If only we had a similar show here in
Gothenburg, Sweden! I certainly should visit it!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Stephan Karnasch likewise will not come, because he is in the middle of preparations for
his A-Level exam.
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg as well will not go to the CeBit: &raquo;To keep my professional career on
track I felt obliged to visit the Hannover show every year. I did it once many years ago,
had to visit business partners, saw just two of them in one day, and afterwards I was so
worn out by all the walking around, that I was happy to head home by Intercity Express
train in the late night!
In the years after that I made a habit of telling my boss about a colleague much better
qualified than I, who was enthusiastic to go to the show.
</P>
<P>
Besides, I always received the show info from our business partners and suppliers
beautifully presented, much better than I could have done it.
</P>
<P>
And why should I today, a pensioner, endure all this grief when all the media carry
detailed reports about it?&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Net result:</B></P>
<P>
I was quite surprised by the low interest among participants in the CeBIT. Not just
because of the possible presentation of the first AmigaDE products this year, but because
I generally assumed that the biggest fair of the world had a high value among  Amiga
users, too. But this seems to be a mis-assessment, perhaps because the CeBIT more and
more has the image of a &raquo;Professional Fair&laquo; in its latest years.
