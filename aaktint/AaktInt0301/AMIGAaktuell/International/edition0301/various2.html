<H2>2. 5 Questions - 5 Answers: Interview with Stefan Ossowski/Schatztruhe</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Increasing fragmentation and discord is the biggest menace to the Amiga.&laquo; - Stefan
Ossowski
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: Mr. Ossowski, what are the reasons for the integrating Schatztruhe
Ltd., founded by you, with GTI?</B>
</P>
<P>
Stefan Ossowski: Schatztruhe Ltd. in itself, will not be integrated into GTI Ltd.; GTI
Ltd. just takes over the operative business of Schatztruhe Ltd. After completion of this
transaction there will be two separate and independent companies (Schatztruhe and GTI).
GTI Ltd. in the future will be on the market as well with the label 'Schatztruhe' and
Schatztruhe Ltd. will no longer be present on the market.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the difficult market situation I got together with Richard Small and we racked
our brains about to what extent it would be possible to extend our existing cooperation
and take advantage of the potential for cost reductions. We agreed to cut costs (rent,
office, marketing, ...) without having to make a single compromise over the range of
products, the products roadmap and customer service. Everything will continue at an
unchanged scale and GTI Ltd. will before long win an excellent reputation in best
Schatztruhe tradition as a quick, reliable and competent distributor and Amiga
consultant.
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: What post will you personally take at GTI? Will the current employees
of Schatztruhe keep their jobs?</B>
</P>
<P>
Stefan Ossowski: Members of our staff from the Technics and Support divisions presumably
will change to GTI Ltd.; right now relevant negotiations are going on. I do not expect
dismissals - GTI will continue Schatztruhe - as proposed - at an unchanged scale!
</P>
<P>
I will certainly assist the new team in the future in an advisory position.
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: You stated that there will be new Amiga products by GTI/Schatztruhe.
What can users expect in the near future?</B>
</P>
<P>
Stefan Ossowski: There are several very interesting projects in preparation, about which
I cannot comment right now. Richard Small certainly will insist on supplying Amiga users
as early as possible with detailed information.
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: How do you see the position of the (former) Schatztruhe Ltd. and about
Amiga firms in general?</B>
</P>
<P>
Stefan Ossowski: The former Schatztruhe has been for more than 13 years right up to the
present a healthy and successful enterprise, the operative business of which is in a good
state. It is this I hand over, with some proudness and of course with a deep feeling, to
a qualified successor.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga market has stabilized within the last months. The new Schatztruhe stands, so to
speak, in the starting blocks - and is eagerly awaiting the developments to come
concerning AmigaNG/ONE/DE/MorphOS/... .
</P>
<P>
With a branch experience of more than 13 years Schatztruhe/GTI will be in the future one
of the key players in the - hopefully prosperous again - Amiga market.
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: What is your view of the Amiga future? What chances do you see for the
AmigaDE and on the other hand for the MorphOS project?</B>
</P>
<P>
Stefan Ossowski: Unfortunately I cannot predict the future. Because of that I cannot
predict which of these systems will make its mark. But I hope that the best architecture
will decide the matter and that all Amiga users left will focus upon this platform to act
in UNISON. Increasing fragmentation and discord is the biggest menace to the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
<B>AMIGA aktuell: Mr. Ossowski, many thanks for answering our questions.</B>
