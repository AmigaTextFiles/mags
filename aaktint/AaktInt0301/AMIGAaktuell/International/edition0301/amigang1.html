<H2>1. New Executive Update from AMIGA's president Bill McEwen</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Bill McEwen - February 06, 2001</B></P>
<P><B>Executive Update - St. Louis and Beyond</B></P>
<P><B>Greetings to the Amiga Family:</B></P>
<P>
In Melbourne this last year, I was able to surprise many of you with several
announcements that were unexpected, and we delivered on each of those.
</P>
<P>
Now we have a new show coming up in St. Louis. In a few weeks we will all learn...
</P>
<P>
Where is the AmigaOne? Will Cringley finally eat his words about a new Amiga? What about
AmigaDE on PDA's, Set Top Boxes, Internet Appliances, or even desktops? Will Tom and
Nicole stay together or is it over? Is there life for the AmigaOS after 3.9?
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the rumors and what many people are saying about our demise, or that we are
going to have the same fate of the others before us, we have a big surprise for all of
them.
</P>
<P>
I look forward to visiting with all of you in St. Louis, and I look forward to taking
over the Hotel, and the surrounding area with the Amiga Spirit, and Community.
</P>
<P>
I hope to see many of you there.
</P>
<P>
There is still time, and in 6 weeks, it will all be known.
</P>
<P>
Bill McEwen, and the rest of the Amiga Team&laquo;
