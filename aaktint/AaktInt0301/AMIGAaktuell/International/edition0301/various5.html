<P><B>Amiga Arena - Special Price Deal!</B></P>
<P>
In cooperation with Bernhard Lindner the Amiga Arena offers
a special price for T.U.M.M.Y!
T.U.M.M.Y is a small specialized database. I manage a big stock
of playing cards from the cards-collecting game Magic The Gathering (&gt;6700 cards). The
special feature of this program are the powerful searching routines, which allow searches
for virtually any card using nearly any criteria you can think of.
Many future improvements are planned, but this depends heavily
on the receipt of registrations.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - AmiAtlas Special Price Deal</B></P>
<P>
AmiAtlas is available until Feb. 28, 2001 at a special price.
Andreas Regul has NOT cancelled the development of AmiAtlas!
(Only that he himself cannot go on developing it.) He still
is looking for a programmer for further development, hobby
developers are herewith called as well!
If you are interested, please mail to

<P><B>Amiga Arena - Toadies Action!</B></P>
<P>
In cooperation with Thilo Koehler there is in the Amiga Arena a
Toadies special with a detailed interview, the update and the
Toadies survey! The freeware game Toadies certainly is the best
&quot;Worms&quot; clone for the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Toadies among others has numerous weapons and characteristics, which even surpass the
original from Team 17!
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - Interview!</B></P>
<P>
An Interview going into details with Thilo Koehler concerning Toadies is in the section
&quot;Aktion&quot;.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - Toadies Version 7.5!</B></P>
<P>
The update to the latest version 7.5 is ready for download in the
section &quot;Aktion&quot;!
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - Toadies Computer Opponent Survey!</B></P>
<P>
Unfortunately Toadies has only a two-player mode, but Thilo on request of Amiga Arena has
agreed to develop a computer opponent, if there is sufficient user interest for this! I
certainly need not point out the general situation of the Amiga market to explain, why a
one-player version of Toadies cannot be released as freeware!
Toadies with a computer opponent would be published as shareware.
With 30 requests and a shareware fee of DM 30.- (appr. 15 Euro) a
computer opponent for toadies would be developed by Thilo K.
Exclusively for the Amiga Arena there would be a special price of
DM 20.-!
</P>
<P><B>Important notice</B></P>
<P>
Amiga Arena has taken these steps only to assist a further
development for Toadies.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga Arena receives no financial share if a computer opponent is developed!
This applies as well to the special price deal of the Amiga Arena, this offer is
non-profit, its only purpose is to assist  high class Amiga software!
It is up to you, the Amiga Arena only can start the ball rolling!&laquo;

<P><B>Amiga Arena - AmigaKonto Full Version!</B></P>
<P>
With permission of Andreas Regul the program AmigaKonto is ready
for free download.
</P>
<P>
AmigaKonto was written to simplify the management of accounts.
</P>
<P>
Especially on drawing accounts with many movements you can quickly lose control when you
have to check transfers which
occur repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
Therefore AmigaKonto serves as a special kind of database, which manages the single
transfer orders. With help of numerous selective and statistics functions out of the
whole
batch of account movements single items can be selected according
to different criteria.
</P>
<P>
The full advantage is obtained when control data of several years are collected and are
available for comparisons, which permits a quick survey of the data with help of
selective functions.
</P>
<P><B>Amiga Arena - Toadies survey; Addendum</B></P>
<P>
The participation at the survey concerning the development of
a computer opponent for Toadies is non-committal!
In spite of Toadies being in the &quot;Downloaded most&quot; section on the Aminet I am quite
disappointed about the current extent of participation!&laquo;
