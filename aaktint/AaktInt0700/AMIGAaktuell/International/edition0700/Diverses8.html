<P>
  AppMI is a big collection of images for toolbars in GlowIcon design, which
  possibly could become a standard for the ClassicAmiga system.
</P>
<P>
  The collection may be aquired free of charge by programmers and every
  interested one, but to maintain the archive a registration is necessary
  and everyone publishing a product using the AppMI ought to concede me
  a copy of the full version of the programm.
</P>
<P>
  Because of this reason only registered users will get the archive.
</P>
<P>
  Now, the registration site for AppMI is online, the release is considered
  at end of Juli 2000.
