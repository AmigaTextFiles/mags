World of Alternatives - Success or Failure?
</P>
<P>
In November of the last year, they all agreed: The »Home Electronics World«, which took place in Cologne at that time
was just disappointing. The first reaction in various Amiga forums about the »World of Alternatives«, which took place
in Neuss, Germany, last month, were mostly positive - they spoke about a »big success« of the Neuss show.
</P>
<P>
But I as a non visitor got a different idea after reading the first show reports. On one hand the Amiga future looks
much brighter again, but were there any highlights for the user to see or to buy? The Amiga SDK is for developers only
and shows just a fraction of the features and possibilities of the new AmigaOS. On the other hand in Cologne they showed
high quality new software releases like AmigaOS3.5.
</P>
<P>
I really mean it: For the users, who don't just want to watch hardware and software, but buying it, the show in Cologne
in 1999 was much more attractive than the one in Neuss in 2000 - and it seems, that this is not just my opinion, because
meanwhile there are critic show visitors, who took the word.
</P>
<P>
That the World of Alternatives was less succesful than the HEW is, withoud doubt, due to the quite chaotic planning of
the date (the already name date was cancelled and the show was put to the Whit weekend, shortly after the date was
announced). I also think, that the place of the show could have been easier to find.
</P>
<P>
But let's stop this discussion - Neuss 2000 is history as well as Cologne 1999 is. And as many visitors as in 1997 or
1998 could not expected due to the current situation of the Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Now, let's see, what the future will bring: After the AmigaNG has been released, AMIGAs presence on the »real«
computer shows, like the CeBIT cannot be avoided. Because only this way leads the company to the direct contact with
users of other computer systems - potential customers of the new AmigaOS. Honestly, I can't wait to see the AmigaNG
in action on events with hundreds of thousands and more visitors - watching the audiences' surprise about its power.
