<H2>4. Game news from around the world</H2>

<LI> Alive Mediasoft

<P>
At last, some reaction to the increasingly hysterical accusations
levelled at Alive Mediasoft. Unfortunately Steven Flowers from Alive
has not replied to the accusations of pirate-copying, but just said
that they will no longer sell games and will shut down the
distribution business. In my opinion this definitely is a confession
of guilt. As well, some photos that compare the  original and the
sort of software distributed by Alive Mediasoft have been
distributed. If that weren't enough, Alfred Knoetig and Dietmar
Eilert (GoldED) said that Alive Mediasoft distributed `unlicensed
copies' (pirate copies). So the scandal built to fever pitch, Alive
Mediasoft closed its business, and it seems there are no
consequences. Bill Gates should be so lucky...

<LI> Elite 3
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
With the withdrawal of Alive Mediasoft, that's the end of Alive's
projects. Except, however, Elite 3 - this is now to be ported by
another company. So there's one Ex-Alive Mediasoft game still on the
release list...

<P>
Users with high-end Amigas who had waited for months finally got
lucky: Heretic II was released at the World of Alternatives show in
Neuss, Germany.<BR>

Unfortunately I could not bring you a taste of Heretic for this
edition, because I do not own a PowerPC board. Two users said they
were keen to test this game for AMIGA-aktuell-International, but
unfortunately they missed the deadline.<BR>

About 3 weeks after the show Hyperion Software announced that
just 400 copies of Heretic II were sold and that their other Amiga
games will be cancelled if sales don't improve. We can only hope that
many more games are sold, so Hyperion can port more high quality
games for the Amiga.<BR>

The development of Shogo is continuing and on the Hyperion
Software homepage there is a new status report. They are considering
the wisdom of an AGA-version or keeping it graphics boards only.
Hyperion also announced a port of Soldier of Fortune, which is based
on a modified Quake2 engine, for Amiga and Macintosh.

Digital Dreams Entertainment announced that the action game Codename
Hellsquad is complete. The game will be available in shops soon. A
demo version, introduced in an earlier edition of
AMIGA-aktuell-International, can be downloaded from the Digital
Dreams Entertainment website.

A demo of Silencer was released this month.  If the games engine can
build on the impressive graphics of the demo, Silencer could be a
smash hit.

Epic Marketing announced this month that the extended version of
Foundation, Foundation Gold, is now available.
Foundation Gold is a mix of the old Foundation and an add-on, The
Undiscovered Land. The game has been completely reworked (incl. all
graphics) and a new game mode added which makes the computer play way
smarter.

Titan Computer released the final demo version of car racer Joyride
early this month. But the Joyride pages (incl. the demo version) were
taken down from the Titan server. Unclear why this happened - all the
other support pages for Titan products are still online. But there is
a preview on Joyride in this edition, if you missed out on the
download.
