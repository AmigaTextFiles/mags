<H2>2. The press conference at the World of Alternatives (by Martin Baute)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;For nearly 45 minutes Bill McEwen spoke about the future of Amiga in an
oppressively hot &quot;conference room&quot; (which was some assembled plastic walls, a
desk and not enough chairs).
There was a lot to hear, so rewind the tape and make it short...
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/WoA3.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WoA3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
After the video-projector woke up on try number 5, Bill McEwen started with
motivation and humour (&quot;Welcome to the Amiga sauna...&quot;). First he dealt with
the rumour that Amiga could have fallen into default on their payments to
Gateway. And better, Amiga would not have any liability.
</P>
<P>
He reintroduced Dean Brown (DKB) as &quot;Director of Hardware&quot;. Mr. Brown  will be
responsible for the reference hardware, which will be a guide for third
parties. Already complete is a handheld games computer, which Amiga will use
internally to impress interested people from the consumer electronics field
with the abilities of the new operating system. Based on a 250 Mips
Strongarm, a connector for a Sony Memory Stick, and a colour display, the
device was completed after one week of development!
</P>
<P>
Mr. McEwen was quite secretive about the new &quot;Vice President of Engineering&quot;
who might be announced on July 10, because he still works for another company
- &quot;one that is large and in trouble, you know...&quot; - as he made a gesture of
ripping a piece of paper...
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Tao Java-VM, he said it was 22 times faster at processing
multimedia contents than any other JVM (!).
</P>
<P>
He was not going to ask the community for patience. The fact that the show
took place and that this (small) room was crowded with people showed that
Amiga users were patient - and had been for about five years. But, he said,
he and his colleagues had only been working for that number of months to meet
the high expectations built up over the years.
</P>
<P>
As the first evidence of success McEwen brought SDKs (software developer kits)
with him. He mentioned explicitly that they were still incomplete and would
mostly be useful for experienced developers. Other users will have to wait
some time for the final complete product. The kits are missing support for
sound, streaming or 3D graphics, but these are on the way (3D support in
approx. 2 months).
</P>
<P>
On the always critical point of marketing  Mr. McEwen said a &quot;VP of Marketing&quot;
has not been hired - he thinks that it is more important to first develop a
product which would be worth a marketing, instead of following Amiga
tradition and making big promises which can't be kept.
</P>
<P>
Plans to offer a developer box as a combination of hardware and software had
been scrapped because of the negative reaction of Amiga users, though this
had meant lots of changes and additional programs (e.g. installation scripts)
were necessary. The SDK was now on sale and the HW/SW developer box would
follow in approx. 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Ubiquity in Computing&quot; is the Amiga goal: mobile phones, PDAs, multiprocessor
servers, the new desktop machines and the new game consoles; all of them
running with the same operating system, something which has not been done
before.
</P>
<P>
Applications will be fully scalable. After the developer decides what to run
his application on, that application can climb the &quot;Food Chain&quot; as high as it
likes. A game written for the handheld would also run on a multiprocessor
system. On the other hand, an application written to run on a server would
not run on a mobile phone - or at best very, very slowly...
</P>
<P>
The processors supported by the operating system would be PPC, M.core, X86,
StrongARM, ARM, SH/3,4,5, MIPS as well as a number of other processors which
could not be revealed, because they were under non-disclosure agreements with
their manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
After that Bill spoke about the JavaOne show held in San Francisco, USA,
the previous week where Tao Group had a booth. The same demos that we were
about to be shown at the Neuss show  were run in San Fran on a Sega
Dreamcast, set-top-boxes, a StrongARM notebook and an x86. This alone would
have been enough to pull a crowd,  but there was also a mobile phone on which
you could play a Pole Position clone - on just 3.5 MIPS. This would have to
be the same mobile phone Scott McNeilly (SUN) showed on stage at the CES in
January ... &quot;I told them, that one day we would have Java on devices like
this one&quot; ... except it was not Sun's Java-VM which ran on the mobile
phone...
</P>
<P>
Linux was not the only operating system  which could host the new Amiga -
others include Windows, WindowsNT, Linux, WindowsCE, QNX and OS/9 (an OS from
Microware, which is the market leader on set-top-boxes). Host support for
iTron, Epox, VxWorks and PalmOS was under development and not far from being
completed.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation with Tao Group was touched on by Mr. McEwen. It was not just
the use of Tao products, but the access to 50 developers from Tao Group to
make things Amiga needed.
</P>
<P>
A port of the BOOPSI libraries has been completed, but needs more tests and
optimizations. A new script language (SHEEP) would also be completed in a few
months. The rights to ARexx are held by a third party, so Amiga had to
develop a new language. The word &quot;Renderware&quot; was also mentioned. The OS
would be prepared for that.
</P>
<P>
Dann hatte Bill McEwen ein ganz besonderes Bonbon: Wenn die einzelnen Teile
des Betriebssystems zusammengefunden haben, wird es den AmigaOne geben -
einen neuen Multimedia-Desktop, entwickelt und designed by Amiga, wenn auch
von Drittherstellern produziert. Mehr wollte McEwen so frueh noch nicht
sagen, der Weg dahin sei noch weit.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/WoA4.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WoA4.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Then, a very special bonbon: If the all the parts of the operating system fall
into place look out for the AmigaOne - a new multimedia desktop computer,
developed and designed by Amiga, but produced by third parties. Mr. McEwen
did not want to say more at this early stage because there was still a long
way to go.
</P>
<P>
Bill moved on to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers - third party
companies, who create and build new Amiga hardware) and ISVs (independent
software vendors - companies that want to support the new Amiga, but who are
too busy with their own business). Mr. McEwen said eleven ISVs had given
source code to the developers at Amiga, because those companies were not
(yet) ready to use their own developers for an Amiga project.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the already known partners of Tao Group were named: Sun, Sony,
Motorola, JVC and others. Mr. McEwen recommended we read the last press
release on Tao's website (about the certification of Tao's Java-VM) and
especially the comments of the other people. Amiga would be negotiating with
each of these companies.
We saw pictures of Mr McEwen's old office and pictures of the new &quot;Amiga
Headquarters&quot;. There are five other companies, which mostly produce high-end
electronics for demonstration and allow Amiga free use of their property.
</P>
<P>
At last we got to see what the new operating system could do, running demos on
a notebook - without hardware acceleration, that is supposed to follow in
August - hosted on Red Hat Linux. It is difficult to put into words, but what
we saw were fast-as-light Java demos, a few 2D games, the well-known Boing
demo, freely (but mouse controllable) flying Boing balls, a browser with
unicode ability, 2D filters, a transparent &quot;Clock&quot; window (a clock, which
could be moved on the screen while you could see the Boing ball through it...
All this was hosted on Linux but there was no stuttering, whatever was going
on.
</P>
<P>
No, that's not correct. I saw it stutter once. Mr. McEwen started the
operating system a second time in another window, and the animation in the
first window stopped for a fraction of a second before continuing smoothly -
while Mr. McEwen ran the same number of demos in the second Elate window.
</P>
<P>
Overall the demo was very impressive, considering the early stage of
development. The photos can only show this partially.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McEwen was not able or did not want to talk about further plans, but he
referred to an article from Byte Magazine in 1994, on <AHREF=&quot;http://www.amiga.com&quot;>www.amiga.com</A>.
A careful read implies things planned which would turn upside down everything you have learned about
distributed computing.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/WoA5.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WoA5.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
At the end Mr. McEwen took questions from the audience.
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: What will happen to the Classic OS?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: We use parts of it, wherever it makes sense.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: Will there be an emulation?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>
McEwen: We already have an executable emulator. The testing is done and now we
are optimizing it for speed. You know Brian King?  You know where he works?
He is a good man. He helps us. Well, we are working on it to make it faster,
it is a bit slow. We are just in the phase of optimizing.</B>
(Remark of the Author: Brian King is the programmer of WinUAE.)
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: Before you ask: am I going to port [the classic OS] to the PPC. No, I
won't. And I'll tell you why: No matter who I talked to - R.J. Mical, Carl
Sassenrath, Allan Havemose - every one of them has had a look at this in the
past. All of them agree it would take about 18 to 24 months, and then would
only be 80% complete. Because the AGA chipset would have to be redeveloped -
Agnus, Denise and all these things are directly linked to the OS. Actually
this was the biggest problem for Havemose when building 3.1. All the bugs of
these chips had to be taken care of.
So, to do the necessary job would be too expensive to make a profit in our
market. We have to move forward, we can't be everywhere, do everything. A
port would not help me to build a scalable operating system, and that is what
we need for success. Just being another system on another chip is not enough.
We must be able to go to Sony, to Panasonic, to anyone, and tell them &quot;we can
use your chip&quot;.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (Hardly understandable. Question about hardware requirements of the SDK, if
it has to be a special processor)</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: The SDK...if you can run Red Hat Linux, everything should be fine. We
tested it using Red Hat and Corel.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: Will it also run on the Amiga?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: No, not at the moment. We have nothing for the 68000. We hope to be
able to cooperate with our friends, so if you have a PPC which can, as you
know, run Linux, you can run it on top. And we will run native on the PPC
boards. This is one of our biggest problems. You got promises and nothing
happens.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: Do you plan to alter the design of the interface?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>
McEwen: It was designed to have a flexibility like the one you saw today, so
you can set it up as you like. There will be various presets - an Amiga user
might like to use a Workbench preset, but other customers might like it a
different way. You can of course customise the presets.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (not audible)</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: If you run Linux on a PPC board on an Amiga, right? We haven't tried
it, yet, but both manufacturers did and they say it would run.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (not audible)</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>
McEwen: No, not with the first build. A part of the problem is the tools. The
tools you need to use it. Currently, there are two companies working on it to
build an IDE especially for us, so this will not be necessary in the future.
Not everything is included (in the SDK) and we know that. Most likely some
things are going to change. But we think it is important that people learn to
write software in VP and some other changes. Chris Hinslwy, who developed all
of this, is someone from the Amiga games scene, as you know. And I think,
that like most of the others who played with it, you might find that there
are many similarities to today's programming style.
So there will be a quick learning curve, but there will be one. We want to get
the people who work with it to start programming some applications. So they
get used to it, so that when the other parts are added they are able to react
more quickly.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (Hard to understand. Another question regarding compatibility with old
applications)</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: Indeed, we have an executable emulator. It is not in this build, yet,
because we are optimizing it. Actually we are also looking for a hardware
solution for it.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: Can all of the SDK be used on an Amiga PPC?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: No, no, no. What's in here, has been made to run with Red Hat or Corel
on a x86 platform, O.K.? If it is complete, and you have an executable OS
running, everything is alright, it will run. Again, we haven't tested it yet.
According to some third party manufacturers it can run on a PowerPC
accelerator on an Amiga, as long as there is Linux present. We haven't tried
it, so I won't say &quot;Yes, it's possible.&quot;. First, we want to test it. We have
machines here we are going to test it on.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (Hard to understand. A question on the expected availability of software
for the new system)</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: We already have promises for 131 applications.</B>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="880000">Q: Also for games?</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: Most of it is games. There is a very large, Indian company, which
makes a lot of interactive games [...].
They already made promises and they are going to bring their games to the
Amiga. They have 63 games, all of them interactive multiuser games using the
net.</B>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="880000">Q: (not audible)</FONT> </P>
<P>
<B>McEwen: Oh, oh, the multiple screens? Yes, they are alright. What you see
today, from a visual point of view, you can have in the future, O.K.? All
these multiple layers, etc. All of this is in it.</B>
</P>
<P>Thank you, very much!</P>

Before this presentation there were two other ones. During the first one at 11
o'clock, I still was on the Autobahn.
For the second presentation the room was overcrowded, but I was able to have
my tape recorder at the desk, just to get the news that Sun is going to
promote the Amiga SDK to their own developers as choice for a Java
environment.
