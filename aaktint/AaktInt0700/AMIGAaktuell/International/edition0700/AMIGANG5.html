<H2>5. AMIGA makes Eyetech manufacturer of developer workstations</H2>
<P>
&raquo;Amiga Inc. and Eyetech Form Partnership
</P>
<H3>June 6, 2000 - Snoqualmie, WA, USA</H3>
<P>
Amiga Inc. of Snoqualmie, WA is pleased to announce a strategic relationship with Eyetech Group Ltd.
of Stokesley, North Yorkshire, UK to manufacture the first release of
the Next Generation Amiga Development Machines and to distribute these
in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
This will no doubt come as welcome news to the British Amiga community
who have long enjoyed an excellent relationship with Eyetech.
</P>
<P>
Eyetech is well known as a leading supporter of Amiga - and the Amiga
Community - of great integrity. Eyetech's involvement in the Amiga
market dates back to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Amiga and Eyetech both share a vision and strategy to re-establish the
next generation Amiga Operating Environment as the leading multimedia
hardware-independent delivery platform for the year 2000 and beyond.
Both companies believe that this strategy will return Amiga to its
rightful position as a leader in multimedia computing, and thereby
redeliver the recognition and pride back to the loyal Amiga community
that has waved the flag over these last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Our relationship with long time company Chairman, Alan Redhouse,
proves that Eyetech has a firm belief in our product, our company, and
our community. Of particular interest to both Amiga and the community
is Eyetechs EZTower Mk5 which networks together - in a single tower
system - both an A1200 (with optional PPC/BVision) with a next
generation Amiga Development Machine and the Amiga SDK. &quot;The
reputation of Eyetech as well as their ability to offer such a high
quality and wide-ranging choice to the Amiga community in the form of
both the EZTower Mk5 and the EZDev-Plus - Eyetech's stand-alone DevBox
- is unprecedented. We wholeheartedly support Alan and his team at
Eyetech and join the community in welcoming Eyetech to the Amiga
future.&quot; said Randall Hughes, Vice President Sales and Strategic
Alliances at Amiga.

&quot;Eytechs Ruf ebenso wie seine F&auml;higkeit, ein Ger&auml;te so hoher Qualit&auml;t und
so weitreichender M&ouml;glichkeiten sowohl als EZTower Mk5 wie auch als EZDev-
Plus - Eyetech's Nur-Entwickler-Ger&auml;t - der Amiga-Gemeinschaft anzubieten,
ist ohne Beispiel. Wir unterst&uuml;tzen Alan und seine Mannschaft bei Eyetech
von ganzem Herzen und begr&uuml;&szlig;en Eyetech zusammen mit der Gemeinschaft in der
Amiga-Zukunft&quot;, sagte Randall Hughes, Vize-Pr&auml;sident f&uuml;r Verkauf und

<P>
Alan Redhouse commented: &quot;I am delighted that Eyetech has been chosen
as Amiga's partner to help UK companies and individuals take advantage
of porting and developing applications under the new Amiga Operating
Environment. We will of course continue to service and support Classic
Amiga users Worldwide from the 5000 square feet (500 square meters) of
warehouse space dedicated to Amiga products here at our UK base.
</P>
<P>
&quot;The Classic Amiga also forms the basis of our Multimedia Presentation
and Kiosk systems as its tightly integrated, purpose-designed
preemptive multitasking, multimedia-centric operating system allows us
to achieve levels of performance, reliability and cost-effectiveness
which cannot even be approached on a PC-based system. We are now
looking forward to developing new, high-performance multimedia
products around the new generation Amiga Operating Environment, as
well as providing continued support for our existing commercial and
leisure customers.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Eyetech's developer platforms for the new generation Amiga Operating
Environment will be officially released on 1st June 2000. The product
portfolio will include EZTower Mk 5 based integrated systems, upgrade
kits for existing EZTower users and the stand-alone EZDev-Plus system.
All systems will ship with Eyetech's 5-click Amiga - Linux networking
software, specially tailored for the new Amiga Operating Environment.

<P><B>About Eyetech</B></P>
<P>
Eyetech was originally established in 1983 to bring the benefit of
automatic data collection systems to large commercial companies. The
Company been closely involved in many high-profile projects - from the
automatic toll collection systems at the Dartford River Crossing
(London, UK) to most of the bar coded track-and-trace systems in use
by the UK national parcel services.
</P>
<P>
Eyetech was founded in 1983 as a subsidiary of an international UK
quoted plc. Since late 1985 - following a management buy out - Eyetech
has traded as a private limited company. The company has mainly been
involved in producing bespoke commercial software/systems - mainly
under Unix/AIX - particularly in the transport and distribution
sector. Eyetechs specialization has been in track & trace systems
using bar codes - in fact most UK parcels carriers that use bar codes
use a system designed and/or implemented by Eyetech. The company also
manufactures bar code decoders and industrial (networked) shop floor
data capture and access control systems.
</P>
<P>
Eyetech became interested in the Amiga, and became a registered Amiga
developer, towards the end of 1993 : Eyetech's Amiga-related
commercial systems currently cover two main areas: As an integrated
multimedia development/mass delivery platform for its existing
customer base with custom systems built around Classic Amiga
architecture.
</P>
<P>
Using rehoused Classic Amiga hardware as a low cost multitasking
platform for shop floor data collection/control applications in
smaller industrial companies, allowing simultaneous local enquiries
and the passing back of data to (typically) an accounts machine as a
background process.
</P>
<P>
In developing Amiga expertise over the course of the last few years or
so Eyetech needed to provide hardware and software components which
were not commonly available ex-stock, competitively priced or of
industrial quality from normal Amiga suppliers. The Company therefore
needed to design and/or sourced these products elsewhere, and
initially entered the retail mail order business by making surplus
stock available to the rest of the Amiga community. This side of the
business has continued to develop, resulting in Eyetech becoming one
of the largest mail order retailers of Amiga products in the
English-speaking World.&laquo;
