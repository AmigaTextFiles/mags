<H2>3. Elbox presents PCI interface for A1200 (by Steffen Haeuser)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;At the Neuss show, Elbox presented a PCI interface for the A1200.
In my opinion this was the biggest surprise at the show, but many people
didn't recognize its importance. I investigated a bit and got some details
(but some things listed below are just copied from the press release of
Elbox):

<LI>&nbsp;Elbox is going to offer drivers for graphics boards, which are based
on these chips:
    <UL>
    <LI>&nbsp;VirgeDX 8 MB</LI>
    <LI>&nbsp;Voodoo 3 16 MB</LI>
    <LI>&nbsp;Voodoo 5 32 MB</LI>
    </UL>
&nbsp;Elbox has nearly completed Picasso 96 drivers. Warp3D drivers for the cards
are under development at Hyperion.</LI>
<LI>&nbsp;Later, Elbox will offer drivers for additional cards (e.g. network
cards, sound cards, MPEG hardware...).</LI>
<LI>&nbsp;An A4000 version will be made available after the release of the A1200
version.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The Voodoo 3 alone is likely to have a 10 times higher fill rate of a Permedia
2, if not even more. And the fill rate is the current "bottle neck" for
Amiga-3D hardware...this is a revolution... and it could be even better... if
drivers for PCI boards are developed NOW, future PCI systems like G3 turbo
boards or the BoXer will have the benefit of this.

<P><B>Conclusion:</B></P>
<P>
This sounds good, but keep in mind that no Amiga-PCI project has ever been
realized. I expect that this will also be true for the Elbox development.
</P>
<P>
I also ask myself: what is the use of another project for the ageing Amiga
hardware? Instead of buying a G3 add-on and the PCI-bridge (if both do get
released), many users might think twice, and wait to buy a brand new computer
to run the AmigaNG operating system or wait to buy the AmigaOne«, which is
promised for late this year.
