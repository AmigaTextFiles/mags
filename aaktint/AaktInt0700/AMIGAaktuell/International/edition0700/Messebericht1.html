<H2>1. The Big Little Fair - a report from Neuss (by Martin Baute)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;The &quot;World of Alternatives&quot; has become small, at least in the space it takes
up: this was my first impression of the World of Alternatives, which was held
in the city hall of Neuss, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Due to the steep drop in the number of visitors and the overall level of the
Cologne fair - already felt in 1998 and noticeable last year - I was afraid I
would come upon something like an improved garage sale.
But while the space was modest, the standard of this fair was in no way
inferior to the Home Electronics World.
</P>
<P>
Lots of well known faces recognized. Maybe TOO well known -  if every other
visitor is one you've seen at a similar event before, then the market needs a
breath of fresh air. Not exactly a new discovery...
There were no fantastic new products to get excited over; the
demo animation of the fantasy simulation &quot;Tales of Tamar&quot; was a remarkable
exception, which the visitors appreciated accordingly every half hour.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, there was not much to be reported about the fair. Yes, here and
there was a new version of some software, or some more hardware for the good
old A1200. At the &quot;individual computers&quot; booth, Jens Schoenfeld displayed one
of the A1000s handsigned by Jay Miner.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
At times the hall was filled to bursting with visitors, but this did not mean
much in such a narrow space.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/WoA2.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/WoA2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, there was a breath of fresh air to come, from the report
&quot;rooms&quot;. Bill McEwen, president of Amiga Inc., had arrived from the USA to
satisfy the curiosity of the users and developers community. He had with him
the first release of the Amiga Software Developer Kit (SDK) - which, contrary
to a previous announcement, was freely on sale without the need to sign a
non-disclosure agreement.
</P>
<P>
I will go into more detail about the SDK later, but first a few small
drawbacks: No, the SDK does not contain a graphical developers environment.
It does not contain a bootable new desktop, where you can test new
applications right away.
Several parts are still missing (e.g. 3D and sound support).
And Amiga Inc's part in this SDK (still) is quite small. The main part comes
>from and is about Tao, the technology partner of Amiga Inc.
</P>
<P>
But otherwise - aside from the almost obligatory C/C++ compiler (a modified
version of gcc) the SDK contains a Java Virtual Machine (according to Sun 22
times faster at display of multimedia contents than any other JVM); a Java
compiler with support for PersonalJava 1.1.7 - certified by Sun; complete
Unicode support; documentation and tools for programming in VP (Virtual
Processor, the object based, binary compatible macro assembler which is the
foundation for the new operating system); and nearly 300 pages of printed
documentation in addition to the 4MB (compressed) online documentation. I let
this speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
At least as interesting as the SDK was the information gleaned from Bill
McEwen's presentation. Partnerships, possibilities, future expectations - if
you compare the efforts of Amiga Inc. with what was introduced by either
Escom or Gateway you have to be delighted with the new team's impetus and
speed. This enterprise's success does not (only) depend on us - Bill McEwen
obviously believes unwaveringly in his project and he knows how to infect
others with his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
It was clear that many people in the audience were keen on more development
for the &quot;Classic&quot; market - the question of the further development of AmigaOS
3.5 arose several times. Bill McEwen dampened down those expectations, but in
an open, honest way and with reasonable arguments: To port the AmigaOS to PPC
might need 18 to 24 months work - and even then this port would only be 80%
complete (compatible), because many parts of the OS are very closely
connected with the custom chips. Because sales of OS 3.5 have been slow - and
a PPC-based hardware successor to the A4000 and A1200 is not in sight - the
effort put into such a port just would not pay.
</P>
<P>
Da sich schon das OS 3.5 nur sehr zoegerlich verkaufen liess - und ein auf
PPC basierender Hardware-Nachfolger von A4000 und A1200 ebenfalls nicht in
Sicht ist - wuerden sich die Anstrengungen einer solchen Portierung einfach
nicht auszahlen.
</P>
<P>
Instead of this Amiga Inc. will concentrate on the new OS (which is supposed
to be an OE - Operating Environment - greetings to Collas) and on new
partnerships. For years we grumbled that &quot;our&quot; latest &quot;mother company&quot; made
crazy decisions, did not recognize marketing opportunities and had not
developed a vision for the future. We can only regret now that, after decades
of technological standstill a &quot;reanimation&quot; of the &quot;Classic&quot; Amigas must be
seen as a &quot;crazy decision&quot;.  Sad, but true!
</P>
<P>
What will the future bring?
</P>
<P>
The SDK is - at least for developers - the first step. Version 1.0 still is
quite limited: It only runs with a Linux installation as host and only on an
x86 processor. Officially tested Linux distributions are Red Hat 6.1
(<B>not</B> 6.2, which contains various bugs!) and Corel Linux. Several users
have successful tested the SDK with the SuSE 6.4 distribution, which is
easier to obtain hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Future versions of the SDK (updates may be downloaded from the internet for
free) will run on other processors, e.g. APUS-Linux with PPC-Amigas - but
also on StrongARM, MIPS, SH/4 and other CPUs, such as the ones commonly used
in games consoles. Compatibility across the CPU borders will also be a part
of the final OS for users.
</P>
<P>
The final OS will be able to use other operating systems as host, for example
Windows (98, NT, CE) or QNX. Support for non-desktop-OS's like EPOC or PalmOS
is under development. Thus, later on it should be easy to &quot;snoop&quot; into the
new AmigaOS, without being forced to change completely - this is an important
argument.
</P>
<P>
Of course the new operating system eventually will not need a host at all, but
will optionally work as a special OS - assuming that relevant drivers exist
(with this in mind Haage & Partner have already announced plans to adapt
their WarpUP accordingly).
Developers are advised to aim at a system with AMD-K6-2 CPU, Matrox G400
graphics board, Soundblaster Live! and 128 MB RAM, because these are the
specifications for the Amiga DevBox.
</P>
<P>
Amiga Inc. will only give full support
on hardware problems to developers with machines bought as a DevBox bundled
with the SDK from a licensed local dealer.
</P>
<P>
And those users unwilling or unable to write software?
</P>
<P>
Well, Bill McEwen announced the AmigaOne, a multimedia desktop with the new
operating system, to be developed by Amiga Inc. and manufactured by a partner
company, as soon as the new operating system is ready. He would not say
anything about the hardware to be used, because it will take some time until
it is ready. On the other hand, as soon as the operating system is ready it
will not matter which hardware platform it will be used on...
