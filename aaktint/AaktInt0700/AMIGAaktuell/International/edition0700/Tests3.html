<H2>3. Software test: Start bar &raquo;Workbench 2000&laquo; (by Malte Mende)</H2>
<P>
&raquo;I think that there is no doubt that the start bar of Windows95+ is the only good invention that Microsoft ever made. That's why I wanted to try out wbench2000 (and because it was the only interesting item on the proposal list ;-) ).
</P>
<P>
But I was disappointed. After unpacking and installing (which was easy, by the way), I looked at the preview pictures. Here it is:
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Workbench2000-1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/Workbench2000-1.jpg" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
I would have liked to make a screenshot when the start bar is open, but if it is open, my computer crashes as soon as I hit an mouse button.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/Workbench2000-2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/Workbench2000-2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="44" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The start bar itself (which appears when you click on the Start button) would be quite useful. Here you could change the Prefs, start programs (If you want to add you own program, you will have to add them to a script. This is a little complicated, because there is no real documentation...), search for files or shut down the computer. I would like to know what happens when I click on the Shutdown button, but as soon as I click on a button, the computer stops.
</P>
<P>
Well, and the rest of the bar isn't very useful. You can just bring windows and screens in front by clicking on the button. But you can't close or minimize them. There are no graphics (as seen in the preview) and, worst of all: no documentation. Only a short description of requirement and a feature list.
</P>
<P>
I tried and installed everything wbench200 needs, but it just doesn't work.</P>
<P>
If somebody got this program to work: I would like to know how. I will write to the author now, maybe he knows...
</P>
<P><B>Result:</B></P>
<P>
You can leave this piece of software in Aminet...

Attention:
The Price/Efficiency rating has no influence on the overall result. Freeware always gets 10 points!
The overall result is my subjective opinion about the program.

Overall: 1 out of 10 points
