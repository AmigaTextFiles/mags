&raquo;One week after the release of the CD&sup3;&sup2; Games Install Kit v3.5 the Cheat and Info Kit add-ons have been released.
The CD&sup3;&sup2; Games Info Kit contains information and pictures about many games and the CD&sup3;&sup2; Games Cheat Kit
offers you cheats for many CD&sup3;&sup2; games. Both add-ons are now available for download in the Downloads section.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Well, finally here are the heavily outdated bonus programs for the CD&sup3;&sup2; Games Install Kit. They shouldn't
be of any use any longer, but they are available for download at least. Get them if you want.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Two releases are here today: Version 2.3 of my SNES9xGUI supports now ham mode setting for AGA users (required only
in 16bit mode). This is needed by WarpSNES v5.0 which will be released the next days. TUP v1.8 has a new tooltype that avoids
the addition to Workbench's tools menu. You can download both new versions in the Downloads section.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Version 1.7 of Da Cool Booter mostly features some bug fixes and small optimizations. Anyway, you should update if
you were using and older version and for all other users: Get this cool program as it helps you to run a lot of stuff much
more easily from Workbench than you might guess. Da Cool Booter is available in the downloads.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;A new version of the CD&sup3;&sup2; Games Install Kit NG is now available in the downloads. This version is a minor
update but it features some cool new things, like Joypad emulation. There are also 4 new games that are supported and some
older ones have been reworked. Get it now.&laquo;
