<H2>3. Foreword</H2>
<P><B>Hello, dear reader! </B></P>
<P>
Here is the games section of July 2000. It might be the beginning  of
the silly season, but this month has been quite exciting. First,
there was the big scandal about Alive Mediasoft, then the Amiga
release of the PC-hit Heretic II as well as the releases of Apano
Sin, Foundation Gold and Foundation - The Undiscovered Land.
But, and I am very sorry, there is no review of these games in this
edition. The try-out of Heretic looked a 100% sure thing... and I
will try hard to get test copies to have reviews for August. But
this has not always happened (not my fault of course!). Let's wait
and see.
</P>
<P>
Now, some sad news: Andreas Koch has neither the time nor games to
keep up the Mac-corner. And with no editor, the Mac-corner has to be
cancelled. This is also true for the PD-Tests from the Aminet section
- Heiko Garrelts has too little time to test Aminet PD-games for
you. Maybe, there is someone out there who will continue this
section....
</P>
<P>
So much for the things we ain't got. Far outweighed, you will find, by
some tantalising news and a previews of Joyride and Silencer. Also,
the release list is a bit more realistic, after a bit of pruning
after the Alive Mediasoft bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
So, have fun with the games section and have a nice holiday, if you
are in a country that has one about now. I will be gone for the second
week of July (but don't hesistate to give me some feedback for the
games section).
</P>
<P><B>Have fun!</B></P>
<P><B>Yours</B></P>
