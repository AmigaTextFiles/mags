<B>JavaOneSM Conference, San Francisco, Ca. June 6th 2000 --</B>
</P>
<P>
Tao Group today announced that its multimedia system for enhancing JavaTM
technology based applications, the intent, Java Technology Edition,
has been awarded Sun Authorized Virtual Machine status by passing
Sun's comprehensive PersonalJavaTM test suites.
</P>
<P>
Over several years intent has been developed by Tao's engineering team
for use in connected devices in home and mobile networks. The emphasis
has been on creating an open, comprehensive, customizable, compact,
fast and binary portable multimedia solution incorporating advanced
capability in streaming audio and video. At its heart is Tao's Sun
Authorized Virtual Machine and libraries. Today, the software is being
deployed in a broad range of markets including digital games, home
networking, digital television, automotive and phones.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Tao's commitment to compatibility is key to furthering the adoption
of the Java platform in growing markets such as consumer digital
appliances," said Curtis Sasaki, director of product marketing,
Consumer Technologies, Sun Microsystems. "Tao's compatible virtual
machine and libraries offer an impressive array of graphics
capabilities to manufacturers developing devices requiring rich
content for consumers.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Bill McEwen, President of Amiga stated that &quot;Amiga continues to
support the world's most sophisticated, multimedia engineering and
artistic community. The New Amiga platform is built around the intent
foundation because only intent provides the infrastructure needed to
meet our market's expectations. Amiga will be a repository for a vast
amount of high value, intent-based multimedia content and we see
compliant Java-language applications running on Tao-based engines as a
fundamental component in making Amiga the de facto standard.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;intent's advanced multimedia technologies in association with Java
technology gives Tao a unique and strong position in the consumer
market," stated Hiro Uchida, General Manager of Strategic Venture
Management Group,Sony Corporation.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;There is a growing market demand for Java applications running on
ARM&reg; core-based devices,&quot; said Andrew Cummins, Java Program Manager,
ARM. &quot;Tao's solution for the ARM architecture provides our silicon and
systems partners with a highly effective multimedia component for the
next-generation of Java enabled devices targeting a wide range of
applications including automotive, digital television and mobile
communications solutions.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Ray Burgess, Corporate Vice President of Motorola noted &quot;Java
technology is fast becoming a requirement in the imaging and
entertainment world. However, size and power limitations have often
limited the experience of using Java software in consumer products.
Tao's fully compliant, accelerated Java engine will help us break
through this limitation and opens up a whole range of new
opportunities for networked Java devices.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Mike Foss, Executive Manager for Hitachi Semiconductor, commented,
&quot;Our support for Tao goes back some years. We are pleased that Tao's
multimedia Java technology support on the SH family of microprocessors
is both compliant and so exciting.&quot;

platforms. Yes Television is a strong supporter of Java technology and
is pleased to be able to take advantage of Tao's unique and compliant
JVM implementation.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Martyn Gilbert, Chief Executive of Amino Communications said,
&quot;While Amino's hardware developments have revolutionized the way that custom
Internet appliances are now being created, Tao has achieved much the
same with its software media capabilities. We've looked at the market
very closely to make sure that we offer our customers the very best
from top to bottom, and Tao is so far advanced beyond any competition
that it requires a double take just to believe it!&quot;

&quot;By combining high performance with a small memory footprint, intent
addresses the demanding requirements of next-generation appliances
based on the QNX® 4 Realtime OS, &quot; said Linda Campbell, vice president
of strategic alliances at QNX Software Systems. &quot;Together, QNX and
intent offer developers a solution that is at once reliable, open, and
media-rich. &quot;
</P>
<P>
Mr. Norizaku Suzuki, President of ASCII Corporation in Japan said,
&quot;ASCII helped sponsor this program and we've watched it develop with
great admiration. Tao's technology has so much value-add that's
critical to the consumer electronics manufacturers, broadcasters,
operators and consumers, and we believe the mass proliferation of
intent is inevitable.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Yasuhiro Kawashima, President of WebLogic, said, &quot;We and Tao are
looking to further differentiate the wonderful intent Java multimedia
products with the introduction of WebLogic's value-added, hardware
acceleration. An inexpensive, super-fast and Java-compliant multimedia
solution is something everyone should be happy about.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;We have had nothing but complete support from Sun. Its openness is
refreshing,&quot; said Francis Charig, Chairman of Tao Group. &quot;I think the
model that they have developed, which encourages companies like Tao to
add value to their standard offerings, is very successful. Tao has
been able to add technologies to help with the binary portability, to
advance memory usage, to bring in new, high value, garbage collection
techniques and customization and many unique features while
maintaining the critical compatibility to the Java specification. Most
significant though is that we are driving forward the digital
appliance market utilizing high performance, multimedia Java based
applications.&quot;
