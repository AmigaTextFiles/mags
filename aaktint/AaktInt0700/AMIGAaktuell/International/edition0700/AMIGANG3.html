&raquo;Espial Joins with Technology and Media Innovators to Launch one of the
First Java(TM) Technology Developer Portals for Internet Smart Devices.

<P>
Espial, a market leader in infrastructure software for the pervasive internet, today
unveiled Devicetop.com, an internet portal dedicated to Java (tm)
technology developers of Web content and application services for internet
smart appliances. Devicetop.com is poised to become a premier Internet
destination for developers interested in extending their programming
skills from the PC desktop to post-PC devices.
</P>
<P>
Devicetop.com is an initiative of Espial supported by Sun, Intel, Motorola,
Amiga, Tao Group, Internet Appliance Network (IAN), Pointbase, Java Report,
Dr. Dobb's, and JavaWorld.com (tm), to develop a vibrant community of
third-party developers focused on creating services for smart devices. The
Devicetop.com portal will be launched in conjunction with the JavaOne(SM)
2000 Developer Conference in San Francisco, the premier global event for
Java technology developers.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from International Data Corporation (IDC), the
market for internet appliances is poised to explode over the next several
years. This market is expected to become an annual 55 million unit market
and $15 billion market in the US by the year 2001. By 2002, shipments of
consumer internet appliances will exceed consumer PC shipments. The
internet appliance market includes handheld PDAs, wireless smartphones,
internet screenphones, web tablets, game consoles, in-car computing, and
interactive TV set-top boxes. The predicted explosion of the information
appliance market and the Java platform being viewed as the de facto
standard for creating third-party developer community and applications,
means that a portal such as Devicetop.com will serve as a catalyst for the
growth of the information appliance market.
</P>
<P>
&quot;The smart-device market is in a rapidly expanding stage, bringing with it
developments that promise to revolutionize the way we work and communicate
on a daily basis," states Mal Raddalgoda, senior director of strategic
marketing at Espial. "The opportunities for creating and developing
smart-device services are limitless and we want to help developers move
quickly from the desktop to devices. The Devicetop.com portal is the next
step to achieving Espial's vision of universal service management for
smart devices where the combination of service-enabled smart devices, the
Internet, and a broad array of services for devices will drive the
deployment of a new generation of telecommunication services.&quot;
