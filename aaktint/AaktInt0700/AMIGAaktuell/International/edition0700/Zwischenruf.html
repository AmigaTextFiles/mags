<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P>
March, march ....
</P>
<P>
In front of me there is an apple .... type &quot;Royal Gala&quot; from New Zealand and it has a nice, sweet smell.
The apple has red lines (from the top to the bottom) and an orange-yellow background.
</P>
<P>
Somehow this bold fruit reminds me of the Boing ball from Amiga. I can't help myself, the look is very similar, if you
foresee from the orange-yellow background and that the Boing ball is red-white squared. (...cough...)
</P>
<P>
A more than 15 year old trademark is alive and well. Of course, my comparison with the apple can only be followed with
much phantasy.
</P>
<P>
But let's have a closer look on the reality: During the last time more and more people ask me about the old flagship
&quot;Amiga&quot;. Often they read a line in the daily newspaper or a small article in the trade press. Amiga is still
alive ... Still? Well, it might be a matter of opinion, if this, what is to come has much of the &quot;Spirit of Amiga&quot;.
However, in the &quot;Openlist&quot; from Amiga Inc. they discuss quite controversial about the SDK.
</P>
<P>
The Amiga crew speaks about their &quot;dream&quot; of an Amiga. It is difficult to discuss a dream, because dreams are
games of the mind - and the mind is free.
</P>
<P>
All criticism and sceptism - may it be justified or not - there is one you should not forget: Trademarks have nothing to
do with colourful click-click-pictures and spells. Public relation is important, but not just since the invention of the
washing powder commercials we all know, that we are not half as naive like this as-stupid-as-bread housewife with
the Mega-Hyper-Super-powerder, which has to kill the &quot;stain monster&quot;. (BTW: The sparkling-water-joker with
his flattering shirt collar is not much better)
</P>
<P>
Good commercials have to wake up a flame in your mind. The never ending curiousity has to be lit up. We, the customers
-aka Amiga users - want to be surprised...
</P>
<P>
Maybe, Amiga Inc. surprises us with a top-class product. And maybe, my apple-hallucinations are replaced by a new
Boing ball in 3D and fat sound in a commercial of superlative.
</P>
<P>
At least, this had the advantage, that I would not be afraid to eat this nice and sweet smelling apple...
</P>
<P>
See you ........ live long and prosper.
</P>
