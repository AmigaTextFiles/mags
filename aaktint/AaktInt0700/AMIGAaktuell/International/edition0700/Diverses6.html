&raquo;Innovative brings Digita(TM)-power to your AMIGA&reg;!Innovative has developed a driver for DigiCams running the
Digita(TM) Operating Environment. Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams offer much more flexibility and abilities than everything else
currently on the market. Digita(TM) is used in high-end-cameras of different companies, runs on PowerPC- and Coldfire-CPUs
and allows you to run scripts, applications and games (incl. MAME!!) on your camera. The developers of Digita(TM),
Flashpoint(TM) wants to make Digita(TM) <B>the</B> standard for DigiCams and specified a standardized communication-protocol
between computer and camera. With the now available VHI-driver, AMIGA-users finally get access to these amazing cameras and
can download and rework pictures from these cameras. Currently available Digita(TM)-enabled DigiCams are
<UL>
<LI>Kodak DC 220, DC 260, DC 265, DC 290</LI>
<LI>Minolta Dimage 1500 EX, Dimage 1500 3D</LI>
<LI>HP PhotoSmart C500, C619, C912</LI>
<LI>Pentax EI-200, EI-2000</LI>
<BR><BR>P.S.: In this case, Digita(TM) has nothing to do with the developers of Wordworth but is the name of a product by Flashpoint(TM).
</P>
<P>
New marketplace (buy & sell) for VHI-boards and -DigiCams<BR>
Due to popular demand, we have decided to create a forum for selling and buying VHI-boards
and -DigiCams. This forum can be reached via &quot;Support&quot; from the VHI Studio-Homepage. The
popular VHI-forum can now also be found there again after a short absence.

New fxPAINT-workshop online<BR>
Yet another workshop for fxPAINT is online. This time it covers the composition
of images and the usage of the magic stick. A must for every fxPAINT-owner! The workshop can be found under &quot;support&quot;
from the fxPAINT-homepage.&quot;.
</P>
<P>
VHI-Exampledriver-sourcecode online<BR>
The VHI-Standard has been extended to support DigiCams recently. Three DigiCam-drivers are
already available. The new extensions are not yet documented and so we decided to release
the sourcecode for the CamEx-driver for download to support the development of new drivers.
The sourcecode can also be used as a basis for the development of drivers for videoboards.
</P>
<P>
VHI Studio 5.2 available<BR>
As there was no time before the World of Alternatives, the archive is released now, after the fair. The new version offers
faster MPEG-Encoding and support for MPEG 2.
