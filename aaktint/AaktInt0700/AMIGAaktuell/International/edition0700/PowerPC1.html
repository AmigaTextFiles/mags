<H2>1. AmiJoe is likely to come in 2001 / A2/3/4000 versions cancelled</H2>
<P>
After severel months of uncertainty Metabox made a statement about the announced Amiga-G3-PPC boards. According to this
there are no longer versions for A2000/3000/4000 computers planned, but for the A1200 only. The product is supposed to
be available in the first quarter of 2001.

<P>
&raquo;<FONT COLOR="880000">There is nothing to be heard about AmiJoe for a long time now. Has Met@box
canceled the AmiJoe Project?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>
The AmiJoe Project is not canceled, but the R&D for CPU Upgrades has other
projects with higher priority.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Some time ago, Met@box announced that the AmiJoe Hardware was running and
only the Software was not ready. How far has the development since the
proceeded?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>Yes, a few weeks ago we really thought that AmiJoe was running well, but
then an error occured. The PCI/Memory controller chip has a bug. Due to
that, you could only use the onboard Amiga-Ram instead of the fast SD-Ram
on the AmiJoe. Without a fully working PCI/Memory controller it does not
make sense to port the WarpOS to the AmiJoe.
</P>
<P>
Since this bug limits the card that much, we´ve decided to redesign the
PCI/Memory controller. But that costs a little bit more time.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">Will Met@box offer an AmiJoe Card for the Amiga 2000, 3000 and 4000 Series?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>We have committed ouerselves to design an upgrade for the Amiga 1200. We
have never said that we will design an upgrade to the 2000, 3000 and 4000
Series. So nothing has been done for machines other than the 1200.</B>
[This is not true. Actually, Metabox announced AmiJoe versions for the A2000, 3000 and 4000 more than once,
partially with quite exact specifications, shipment dates and prices; remark of the editor]
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">When will the AmiJoe 1200 be available?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>We do not want to make the mistakes of other companies, which announce at
first and then start with development. We are only willing to release a
fully working product and therefore the Amiga community has to wait until
the end of 2000, or even until the 1. quarter of 2001.</B>

<B>
(*)We will publish the pinout of the PCI Connector, so that 3. party
developers can built a PCI-backplane for the AmiJoe. A Graphics card is
planned but not yet designed. The Graphics card will occupy the PCI
Interconnect, so that no Backplane can be used.</B>
</P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR="880000">What about pricing?</FONT>
</P>
<P>
<B>An exact pricing is not possible in the moment. But we expect a price for
under 500$ (approx. 543.48 Euros).</B>&laquo;
