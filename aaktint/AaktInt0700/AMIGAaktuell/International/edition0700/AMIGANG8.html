<LI> Contrary to other informations, Bill McEwen said, that the company will build memory protection into the operating
system of the AmigaNG. Goetz Ohnesorge from the developer support said, that most of the members of the developers
department would have this feature implemented the common way.

<BR><LI> Some days ago, the US-TV station CNNfn aired a live interview with AMIGA president Bill McEwen. A transcript
can be found on <A HREF="http://cnnfntech.yellowbrix.com/pages/cnnfntech/Story.nsp?story_id=11680" TARGET="_top">http://cnnfntech.yellowbrix.com/pages/cnnfntech/Story.nsp?story_id=11680911&amp;ID=cnnfntech&amp;scategory=Computers.</A>

<BR><LI> In an interview with the internet service GamersDepot.com (<A HREF="http://www.gamersdepot.com/interviews/amiga/001.htm" TARGET="_top">http://www.gamersdepot.com/interviews/amiga/001.htm</A>)
AMIGA president Bill McEwen said about the AmigaNG, that the DEC Alpha would be his preferred processor and he would use
it, if he can. In the moment two chip manufacturers applied for AMIGA. Late this year there would be an announcement.
So it seems possible, that the Alpha-processor could be used for the &raquo;AmigaOne&laquo;.
</LI>
<BR><LI> In the same interview Bill McEwen said, that they would naturally planned to go to stock.

<BR><LI> According to Gary Peake, AMIGAs &raquo;Director for Developer Support&laquo;, there will be four different
support levels for developers (in ascending order).

<LI> Scout: Level for Freeware-, Giftware- and OpenSource- developers
</LI>
<BR><LI> Trailblazers: Level for small Shareware- / commercial developers
</LI>
<BR><LI> Pathfinders: Level for large commercial developers
</LI>
<BR><LI> Premier Partners: tight partnership with AMIGA
</LI>

<BR><LI> According to Gary Peake the AmigaNG developer software may be installed on various computers - with the same
copy - what is different to other computer programs. The company wanted not limit developers, who have a computer at
home and at their working place.
</LI>
<BR><LI> For operating the Amiga SDK a network card has to be installed, but actually its use is not required. The
version of the used Soundblaster soundcard is irrelevant, according to Gary Peake.
</LI>
<BR><LI> AMIGA put a more functional menu bar on their website, where you can select an area for investors. There e.g.
the graphics board manufacturer Matrox is listed as AMIGA partner.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Some weeks after the HGML the PDF-version of AMIGAs Online-magazine Amiga World 05/00(!) was released. It can
be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com/press/zine/6-3-00/AW2.pdf" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com/press/zine/6-3-00/AW2.pdf</A>.
