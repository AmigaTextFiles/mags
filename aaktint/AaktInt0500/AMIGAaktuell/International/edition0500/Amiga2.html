&raquo;Amiga Announces Plans to Embrace Sun's JavaTM Technology as the software
platform for forthcoming New Amiga products
</P>
<P>
Amiga is the home of a large number of the world's leading edge multimedia
developers, artists and users.
</P>
<P>
Historically, the Amiga platform has targeted providing the most compelling
multimedia content to desktop systems, but the new Amiga platform will
address connected, multimedia digital appliances such as webphones,
digital TVs, and web pads. Now the world's most creative multimedia
engineers can leverage the JavaTM platform to target a vast array of new
products and solutions. The underlying technology used in the Amiga system
is a Sun Java branded version of PersonalJava developed by the Tao Group.
Tao's software is a media-rich environment that was designed from the
ground up to run on a wide range of low cost, processor and memory
constrained consumer devices that offer a wide range of multimedia
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Within Amiga's new target markets, several key standards groups are
adopting Java technology; HAVi, OSGi and DVB are three examples. Amiga is
adopting the popular Java platform for developers creating new generation
content and applications that could also be used on industry standard
devices such as in home networking and digital television. The millions of
Java technology developers will be able to deploy their innovative content
on a wide range of new products that will excite consumers.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We are excited to see a longtime favorite of the multimedia developer
community turn to Java technology as their programming platform of choice.
The deeply loyal Amiga developer community will be able to leverage the
wealth of Java development tools and support to build new, highly
innovative and fun applications. We are also pleased that Amiga will work
with the Tao Group, a company dedicated to compatible implementations with
media rich capabilities,&quot; said Curtis Sasaki, Director of Product
Marketing, Consumer Technologies, Sun Microsystems, Inc.
</P>
<P>
&quot;The New Amiga is a breath of fresh air for the industry, and has a talent
pool of developers who continue to lead the way in the creation of dynamic
software products,&quot; commented Bill McEwen, President and CEO, Amiga. &quot;Sun
and the Java platform provide us with great tools, a large number of
potentially new developers, and a well supported platform, and experience
in emerging markets. The Tao intentTM implementation is unique in being
able to provide the key system requirements needed to run the Java
platform in mobile and consumer products.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Francis Charig, Chairman of Tao Group says, &quot;Combining the world's most
advanced community of multimedia artists and engineers with the new
industry standard software [Java] is the next natural step forward. It is
wholly appropriate that Sun, Tao and Amiga work closely together and the
result shall be a wealth of Java technology-based media content for the
consumer and other markets.&quot;

Remark from Gernod Schomberg about &quot;FAST 50&quot;
(extracted from a press release on another company):
(Auszug aus der Presseveroeffentlichung einer anderen Firma):
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Deloitte &amp; Touche Fast 50 Winner
</P>
<P>
Companies, who want to be considered  for the status &quot;Fast 50&quot;, have to produce a technology or a technology based
product. Their efforts have to be mainly in research and development. The order of nominations is based on the percentage
of growing company income within a five year period, which has to start with at least 50,000 US-$.
</P>
<P>
Bob Weaver, partner of the technology group Deloitte &amp; Touche, based in San Diego, CA says:
&quot;To be named as a Fast-50-winner is a confirmation of the outstanding position of a company and their ability to
make not just the right decision at the right time, but to have the vision to grow continously about 5 years.&quot;
