<H2>1. Softwaretest (Update):WWW-Browser Voyager 3.2 (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Introduction:</B></P>
<P>
The promise the Vapor team made with the last release of Voyager was fulfilled
on 9-Apr-2000. Version 3.1 of Voyager was released. But because this version
was far from being bug-free, the new version 3.2 was already available about one
week later from the Vapor server.
</P>
<P>
The development of the new release took about 4 months. Here we're going to see
whether this work was worthwhile. I'm refering to my last report about Voyager,
which can be found in AmigaAktuell 3/2000, and this time I will mostly write about
the new features and problems of this browser. Because there is (at the time of writing)
no updated documentation available, I can guarantee for the correctness of this report.
In the further test, Voyager may be abbreviated as &nbsp;V&nbsp;. When I'm writing about
the &nbsp;APdf&nbsp; software, I'm refering to the new version 2.2 by Emmanuel Leseur.
The system used for this test was a Amiga1200 with a Blizzard1230/IV, FPU,
64 MB Fast-RAM, several GBytes of harddisk space and the standard AGA chipset.
The running software was (among others) FBlit3.56, MCP1.33 and AmigaOS3.5.
The requirements for hardware, software and user(!) haven't changed since the last
version, so I'm just over this skipping to the...
</P>
<P><B>Installation:</B></P>
<P>
For those of you who already have version 3.1 installed, it is sufficient to
download and install the archive v3_update_31_32. The installation has be carried
out &nbsp;manually&nbsp;. Just copy the file &nbsp;V&nbsp; in the Voyager-directory and the file
&nbsp;mui/SpeedBar.mcc&nbsp; into &nbsp;MUI:Libs/MUI&nbsp;. Everyone else should download the archives
v3_32, vflash_1.2 and pophotkey_1715, which corrects a problem in the V preferences
window. Developers interested in the V's new Plugin-API (Application Port Interface)
should also get the voyager-sdk archive. It contains the sample plugin &nbsp;Zapster&nbsp; with
source and all other developer files.
</P>
<P>
If you want to install the PDF-plugin, you should get the Apdf distribution from the
subdirectory &nbsp;VPDF&nbsp; on the Vapor server or from the website of Emmanuel Lesueur.
It consists of the archives Apdf_common.lha, Apdf_fonts.lha and the Apdf-binary-archive
suitable for your CPU. You can read about the installation in the test report by
Uwe Pannecke. I would just like to mention that during the installation of Apdf, you
can also install the PDF-plugin for Voyager.
</P>
<P>
After downloading and unpacking all archives, you can start the installation
itself. It is done through the Amiga installer and without problems. It takes care
of older versions of Voyager and existing keyfiles. Older icons are overwritten.
</P>
<P>
The archive vflash_1.2 contains a plugin to display flash animations. It is available
in different versions optimized for several 68k-CPUs. The archive also contains
a version for PPC boards. It makes use of the PowerUp system. I couldn't test whether
it works with the PowerUp emulation for WarpUp, due to the lack of a PPC board.
</P>
<P>
Of course the plugins should be installed after Voyager itself. They use the
Amiga installer, too, and are again without any problems. If you should experience
crashes while using the preferences window of Voyager, you should copy the file
pophotkey.mcc in the directory MUI:Libs/MUI. It comes it the archive pophotkey_1715.lha.
</P>
<P><B>Here we go:</B></P>
<P>
The icons still have the a little old-fashioned look of MagicWB. Hopefully
Vapor will find an artist to polish these up, since they look quite strange
under OS3.5.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Another thing I was missing was an updated documentation. As it is, the user
has to &nbsp;explore&nbsp; the menus and windows on his own and try to guess how the new
new feature work. The MUI bubble help is quite helpful but can not replace
a documentation.
</P>
<P>
The requester which nags you at every start of Voyager about registering has been
slightly modified. In this version there is a pause of 30 seconds. After 30 days (?),
the pause gets one second longer. After reoval fo my keyfiles for testing purposes,
I had to wait 2 minutes before I could start browsing ;-). Also new is a small progress
bar displayed during startup. When the browser window is up, you can't see much of the
new features. Most of them are internal or hide inside the menus or the preferences.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
For example is the patch &nbsp;FBlit&nbsp;, which can speed up the graphics speed of
AGA-Amigas and reduces the Chip-RAM consumption of the Workbench, now supported
directly. This is results in a faster layout of pages and graphics and a lower
usage of Chip-RAM. Furthermore, the internal Plugin-Interface was reworked, the
keyboard shortcuts now work as they are supposed to be and TurboPrint 7 is
used for printing, if installed. Voyager can now be iconified from any window. In
earlier versions this was only possible from the first browser window.
</P>
<P>
But the most important new feature in Voyager is the support for different font
faces in websites and the ability to use TTF (True Type Fonts).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-fonts.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-fonts.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="59" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If you stumbled over such a website in the Internet, you may have noticed that
the layout of the frames, tables etc was somehow messed up or that the text was
unreadable or not visible at all. Now the Voyager user has the possibility to
get rid of this mess. But only the possibility.... because suitable fonts
are not included. I have listed the sources for the most commonly used web fonts
at the end of this article. Matt Sealey has written a brilliant tutorial about the
usage of TTF onts in Voyager, I can only recommend it to every user of Voyager.
With these instructions, the appearance and compatibility of Voyager is greatly enhanced.
For example: Before installing the fonts, I was absolutly unable to read anything on
the website of MetaCrawler (www.metacrawler.com).
</P>
<P>
If you want ot use TrueType fonts you will have to install the ttf.library.
It can be found on aminet or from the sources listed on the end of the article.
</P>
<P>
Some bugs in the cache managemant have been fixed. The upper limit of the cache
size is no longer ignored and exceeded. A new &nbsp;Cache-Pruner&nbsp; has been added. With
this function, you can cut down the cache while still being able to view the remaining
sites with all objects. Under version 3.0.52 you had the choice of &nbsp;all or nothing&nbsp; (if
you were able to delete the cache at all....).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-cachepruner.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-cachepruner.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="57" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
If problems with certain websites should arise after the installation, it might prove
useful to flush the complete disk cache, without using the cache pruner.
</P>
<P>
As many Amiga users will have noticed, some webdesigners try to make sure that their
works only can be shown with the &nbsp;right&nbsp; browser. To circumvent such restrictions, V
has a feature called &nbsp;Spoofing&nbsp;. It enables you to mask Voyager as Netscape Navigator or
Interent Explorer. This feature has been updated, too. You can now spoof with 3 different
browsers and even edit their ID strings. So if you want, you can always appear as
if you were using the newest Internet Explorer of version 9.5 of Netscape Navigator (a
version that doesn't even exist yet...). The webmasters will be astonished ;-).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-spoofing.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-spoofing.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="61" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Whether these pages, which insist on a special browser for a reason, can be displayed
properly is another issue.
The Javascript(JS) compatibility has been enhanced. Even though I can't say yet how much
it was improved, I noticed that &nbsp;finally&nbsp; JS-based ad banners are displayed and
the Help function of GMX (www.gmx.net) works now. Of course the &nbsp;Javascript-problem&nbsp;
on the amiga is far from being solved.
</P>
<P>
The new VPDF Plugin surely is a special goodie. It makes it possible to display
PDF (Portable Document Format) documents wihtin a webpage. It is based mostly
on the source code of Apdf2.2 and behaves accordingly. Further informations
on Apdf2.2 can be found in test report by Uwe Pannecke in this issue.
VPDF uses the same postscript fonts as Apdf2.2. This results in an efficient usage of
disk space and en excellent quality. Options like zoom, anti-aliasing, etc. can be
changed from a popup menu. The navigation inside the pdf files is just the same as
in Apdf, only that the user interface is integrated inside Voyager.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-vpdf.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-vpdf.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The speed of VPDf on a 68030 processor is, compared the AcrobatReader under a
Mac emulation still a little slow, but in comparison to older ports like xpdf
and taking the postscript fonts into consideration, it is quite good.
The PDF decoder modules are the same as in Apdf. This means also that, provided
you have PPC board, you can of course the PowerPC module, which should make
the question of speed irrelevant ;-). The module for encrypted PDF files,
&nbsp;ApdfDecrypt_xxx.module&nbsp; (replace xxx by 68k resp. PPC), is supported, too.
The preferences are set through Voyagers Plugin prefs window. If you encounter
problems with PDF files, you can select the correct module from the preferences
window (on the test system, it was &nbsp;Apdf_68030fpu.modul&nbsp;).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-vpdfmodul.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-vpdfmodul.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="56" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Voyager, the VPDF plugin is localized. It supports the same languages
as Apdf.
</P>
<P>
Another plugin that has been heavily reworked is VFLASH. It finally is out
of the beta status. Now it can handle sound output and some animation that weren't
compatible with older versions. The speed has been improved and many bugs have been
fixed. If you visit a website with Flash animations, the plugin will load the whole
animation into the memory (resp. the disk cache) and play it from there.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-vflash0.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-vflash0.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="75" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
For this plugin you should at least have a 040 processor and a graphics board, since
with AGA and a 030 the sound and framerate is very faltering, even with small anims.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/voyager-vflash1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/voyager-vflash1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="91" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
In the plugin preferences, you can choose how the sound should be played. It
offers for example the &nbsp;audio.device&nbsp; or the &nbsp;AUDIO:&nbsp; driver from AHI. But
you should not change the preferences while viewing an animation, because this has
always caused a total crash in the test configuration. Spekaing of &nbsp;total crash&nbsp;,
this laeds us to....
</P>
<P><B>Stability:</B></P>
<P>
While I was disappointed with V3.1, the update to 3.2 is more convincing. The stability
was enhanced compared to prevous version. It is no longer possible to crash V by
moving TearOff objects around. It also got stabler on some website which tended to cause
a crash after loading. But the crashes have not disappeared completely. Especially
the plugin interface seems to be a little unstable. Furthermore, Voyager doens't know
a &nbsp;soft&nbsp; crash (when the OS just tells you that the task was halted. If Voyager crashes,
then completely. Because of this, you should always save important data before starting
V.
</P>
<P><B>Result:</B></P>
<P>
Voyager is a fast and comfortable web browser which even has some features
unknown in the Wintel world. The new features are very useful and increase
the compatibilty. It may even be that the instabilities were only noticeable on
the test system. Anybody can get the public demo to see how stable Voyager is
on his won system. But I doubt that the choice of PowerUP as PPC system is wise.
The alternate system by Haage&Partner seems to me the better way for future versions.
And the missing documentation, which will hopefully be delivered soon by Vapor, is
especially missed for the new features.
