<P>
Amiga's Relationship With Corel a Great Success!
</P>
<P>
Snoqualmie, WA, April 1, 2000 - Amiga Incorporated, is pleased to announce
that its new multi-media consumer interface is well supported by Corel
LINUX OS and other Corel applications including the newly released
WordPerfect Office 2000 for Linux.
</P>
<P>
Amiga's multi-media consumer interface runs extremely smooth and fast on
Corel LINUX OS, and the compatibility between these great products has
provided Linux developers with a new and exciting way to create incredible
multi-media titles, and games for Linux.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Amiga pioneered the creation of multi-media, and easy to use graphical
interfaces 20 years ago, and today begins the path of the reintroduction
of a legend. The New Amiga is the creation and embrace of leading
technologies and combining them with the 20 years of experience in multi-
media development environments,&quot; said Bill McEwen, president and chief
executive officer of Amiga. &quot;Corel has leading products within their
categories, and we are excited about their supporting Amiga towards the
future.&quot;
</P>
<P>
&quot;Linux developers now have choices when it comes to leading edge
applications,&quot; added McEwen.
</P>
<P>
&quot;Corel is dedicating extensive resources to develop Linux, and receiving
such a positive endorsement based on Amiga's experience with our products
is tremendous,&quot; said Dr. Michael Cowpland, president and chief executive
officer of Corel Corporation. &quot;Corel takes pride in producing quality
products, and we are thrilled to provide our Corel LINUX OS to Amiga's
world-class systems. We look forward to working with Amiga as they
continue developing products and technology for current and future
computing devices which are focused on making computers and the Internet a
natural part of everyday life.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Corel and Amiga first announced they were working closely to support the
new Amiga Operating Environment in July 1999. The two companies formed a
new relationship to ensure that Corel's award-winning software
applications were supported on Amiga's new line of products. Corel and
Amiga continue to discuss possible future alliances.

There will be full support for the existing install base of Amiga users,
and more announcements will be forthcoming about the current Amiga and the
