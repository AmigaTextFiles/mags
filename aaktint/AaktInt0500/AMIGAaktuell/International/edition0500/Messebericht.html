<H2>1. Pre-informations about the Amiga show &raquo;World of Alternatives&laquo;</H2>
<P>
As already announced in the last edition there are additional informations about the show &raquo;World of Alternatives&laquo;,
which might become the only German show with important Amiga presence, this year.
The data were taken from the official show homepage (<A HREF="http://www.amiga-messe.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga-messe.de</A>):
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Your dream becomes true: The great show of alternative computer systems &quot;AMIGA&quot; and &quot;ATARI&quot;
happens at last.
</P>
<P>
It's soon - the date is June 10/11, 2000.
</P>
<P>
And you should enjoy this unique event in Neuss, Germany.
</P>
<P><B>The location</B></P>
<P>
The location of the first &quot;Amiga and Atari show&quot; is the Stadthalle Neuss (city hall), a reliable target of the
ATARI fans since 1996. Neuss is a city near Dusselsdorf and can be reached easily from anywhere in Germany as well as
from the Benelux countries. Centred within the most habited cities of Northrhine Westfalia Neuss is an ideal location for
several thousand fans of these two alternative computer systems.
Please find an exact (German) description how to come to us on the page <A HREF="http://www.atari-messe.de/anfahrt.htm">Ihre Anfahrt</A>.
Anfahrt.
</P>
<P><B>The participants</B></P>
<P>
Amiga and Atari fans can enjoy one of the most interesting shows of the last years. An event, which promisses so many news
as there have not been for years. Not without reason there are more commercial exhibitors e.g. from the Amiga market as
on any comparable show of the last years.
</P>
<P>
Crowd-pullers of the show should be the boothes of Amiga and Milan Computersystems, because both successors of their markets
have outstanding news with them.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the the still kept secret, future leading computer system of the next generation will be introduced
in Europe. Together with the British software manufacturer Tao a completely new type of operating system concept was
developped, which will be similar to the usability to the current Amigas, but will be much more powerful than the current
computers. An introduction, the whole Amiga community waited many years for.
</P>
<P>
The inofficial Amiga successor &quot;Milan Computersystems&quot; also announced a new introduction for the show in Neuss:
Nearls 2 years after releasing the Milan 040 there will be a Milan II, a powerful home and office computer. Together with
the partners AXRO and Motorola the concept of the Atari successor was reworked and updated in many ways, so the Atari fans
will get a unique new computer concept. The show is considered a general test before introducing the new Milan nationwiede
in late summer 2000.
</P>
<P>
Of course, there will be various exhibitors of both markets, which announced various new things for their customers.
Please take a look on the <A HREF="http://www.atari-messe.de/ausstel.htm">Ausstellerverzeichnis</A>

<P><B>&raquo;How to find us</B></P>
<P>
Neuss is near Dusselsdorf and so it is not just in the centre of Germany, but in the centre of Europe. If you come from
the Benelux countries, France, the Czech Republic or Southern Germany.
</P>
<P>
The distance to the mecca of the Amiga and Atari world is little and acceptable for everybody. So, Neuss is worth a trip,
when the Amiga and Atari show happens there.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the show, Neuss and the neighbour cities like e.g. Dusselsdorf offer a number of attractions. If you make
your visit to a complete family weekend, you want e.g. visit the modern 3D cinemas of Dusselsdorf, you can get informations

<P>
During a one hour long talk with Petro it was confirmed, that Amiga will participate the show in Neuss, Germany! An own
booth will not be useful, because Amiga has nothing to sell, yet. But there are various presentations of the new Amiga
system each day planned, which will be during press conferences and workshops. It is expected that Bill McEwen, Fleecy
Moss and Petro will present the systems. Parallel to that they answer the questions of the users not just during the
presentations, but directly at the booth of the Falke Verlag. Promotion-Items, authographs etc. are given with pleasure
by Petro and the others. Let's wait and see for the presentation.&laquo;
