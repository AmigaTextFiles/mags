<H3>1.  What is Bonds?</H3>
<P>
In short: Bonds is a program to manage, process and optically display
bonds, indices etc. from the stock market. It helps the investor to keep
an overall view of the financial market, to make simple analyses of charts and
to justify the decision of purchase on the basis of several factors.
</P>
<H3>2. Requirements</H3>
<P>
Required are only a 68020+ processor, Kickstart 3.0 and 1.5MB RAM.
But the programs get only really interesting if you have Internet access
(or alternatively Video-Text) to update prices automatically. Furthermore it
would be adviseable to have a screen resolution high enough to arrange all
windows orderly.
</P>
<H3>3. The Installation</H3>
<P>
The installation is uncompliated. It's enough to unpack the archive, which
you can get form the Internet, anywhere on the harddisk.
For users of older versions it is even sufficient to copy a few into the old
&nbsp;Bonds&nbsp; directory. Maybe it will be necessary to run a (included) tool to
convert old depots (before V.176) into the new standard.
Double-clicking on the program icon and selecting the screen is enough to
start the program.
</P>
<H3>4. First impressions</H3>
<P>
After the first start, the program interface appears very tidy.
By default it opens five windows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> an icon bar, for the most common commands</LI>
<BR><LI> an object list, which lists the bonds by type</LI>
<BR><LI> the graph displaying the chart for the selected object</LI>
<BR><LI> a chart overview managing the chart data as a list</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF="img/bonds1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/bonds1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="95" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The handling is very intuitive. A click on a title in the object list automatically
updates all other windows. The most important thing for the chart analysis
is the graph, of course. In Bonds, it is displayed as a simple line-chart and
can optionally contain the volume of trade as well as freely defineable smoothing line.
With the help of the draw mode, you can quickly perform simple methods of chart analysis -
for example by drawing supporting lines or trend channels.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/bonds2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/bonds2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="74" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
The program offers, beside the analysis function, also a depot management,
which is currently only rudimentary implemented. Here you can catalogue
bonds wiht date of purchase, price of purchase and current price. So
it offers a very clear display of the contents of your depot.
</P>
<H3>5. The features</H3>
<P>
So if you got used to the basic usage of the program, you will want to
use all possibilities it offers you.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is to get data and information about different bonds.
The program kindly provides a list of bonds with data for the last months
right after the installation.
</P>
<P>
If a desired bond isn't present here, it can easily be added. Either manually,
by typing in all available information or, and this is the much more elegant way,
via Internet - just type in the bond's identification number and you will get
all necessary informations like name, area of business, trading place as well
as soem key values (dividend, etc) and of course the current price and the
volume of trade.
</P>
<P>
Updating the data is just as easy (provided you have Internet access or videotext).
Just a click on &nbsp;Update&nbsp; while you are online and within a few seconds, you
have all the lastest information. Updating via Videotext should work that easy, too,
but it hasn't been tested here.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, data can be imported an exported as
CVS files. This makes it possible to exchange data with other information collectors,
which often provide the only source of older data.
</P>
<P>
The next step would be the creation of your individual watchlist.
Bonds can be added with a single mosue click, to monitor their development
during the next days and to keep an eye on interesting values.
</P>
<P>
If you made a decision for buying or selling an investment, you have to
update your deopt afterwards. Of course Bonds can't spare you the way to your
broker, but it can display an overview of all bonds currently in the depot.
Selling and buying is still quite elaborate because the portfolio manager
has been completely rewritten in version 1.72. The bonds have to be selected
in the object list and can be bought or sold with a button. The current version
has the option to take a provision (in percent of the bonds' price) and a
minimum provision into the calculation; this saves you from manually
calculating the real price of purchase resp. profit.
</P>
<P>
The depot manager brings an overview of name, number of bonds, last price,
postion value and the absolute and relative gain. Furthermore it give
a statement about the depot development in percent and the overall value
in Euro.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/bonds3.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/bonds3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="27" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Everyone, who would like to speculate in the stock market, but wants to
get some experience (or the necessary strup capital) can use the depot manager
to create a sample depot. So you can, without any risks, get a feeling for the
right strategy and it makes it possible to speculate with higher amounts -
a luxury you probably can't have in reality...
</P>
<P>
For hasty investors will be (among others) the performace analysis of all
bonds most interesting. In the from of a ranking, all bonds are listed for
ceratin key values, which gives a quick overview. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds can be examined for their price/gain relation, the gain per share, or the dividend. The winners
and the losers of the day can quickly be found.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/bonds4.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/bonds4.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="95" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
Finally there is the possibility to run two bonds in the same chart for a direct
comparison. This is done with a percentual scale, but regrettably only for two
bonds at a time.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/bonds5.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/bonds5.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="52" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<H3>6. Result</H3>
<P>
Beside the fact that bonds is probably the only bonds software for the german
on the Amiga, it can also convince with the implemented features and
the simple, but optically solid design.
</P>
<P>
Even though you may notice by a few bugs and some missing features that the program
isn't completely finished yet, it is already fully functional and runs
absolutly stable (on my system).
</P>
<P>
The things I'm missing most are indicators and oscillators which are necessary
for a complete technical chart analysis. But since the author develops
the program consequently it seems to be merely a matter of time until these
functions are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Left to say is that the registration fee of 20 DM (approx. 10.20 Euros) is very justified,
compared with others, much more expensive programs for the PC and
with regard to the huge amount of work in this projects. Such active
work for the Amiga should be supported.
