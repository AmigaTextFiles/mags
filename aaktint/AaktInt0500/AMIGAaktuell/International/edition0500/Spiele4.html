<P>
At last, this month it was done: The most awaited Amiga game has been released in a playable demo version. The demo of
Heretic II of Hyperion Software has approx. 40 MB and requires a powerful Amiga. These are the system requirements:
<UL>
<LI> PowerPC processor</LI>
<LI> WarpOS4</LI>
<LI> 64 MB RAM</LI>
<LI> 70 MB of free hard disk space</LI>
<LI> AGA or graphics board</LI>

<LI> Hyperion Software recapitulates
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Soon, Hyperion Software will have their first birthday and take this chance to get a result. In this time, Hyperion
did impressive work; so some standards of the PC world like 3D games or video codings, which allow it to port PC
games much easier, because the desired developer interfaces already exist on the Amiga, were ported to the Amiga.
In addition to that a FAQ was published on the homepage of Hyperion Software. We can take a good look on the products
of Hyperion Software, because due to their work Hyperion is the great white hope in matters of Amiga games.

and hopes for new pre-orders. There is also a new trailer for Nightlong on the portal of clickBOOM. The completed version
of Nightlong is supposed to be released within the next weeks. You can read a test here, then.

<LI> CDsup3;sup2; rising again?
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
During the last time there are news about the CDsup3;sup2;, which nearly fell into oblivion. So, a group, named
CD32 alliance was formed, which wants to motivate developers to focus more on the CDsup3;sup2;. Also Christian Steiner,
developer of the well-known PD game Sharks! is about publishing a CDsup3;sup2; version of his game. So, let's wait and
see. If anything will be published, I will write a test about it, because I am also a prowd owner of a CDsup3;sup2;,
which was produced only in a little number of 100,000 pieces.
