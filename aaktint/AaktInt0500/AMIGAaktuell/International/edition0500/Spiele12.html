<P><B>introduction :</B></P>
<P>
Caesar II is a strategy game which at first sight inevitably reminds you of
the cult game Sim City and its sequel and its' clones. The only difference
is, as you might guess by having a closer look at the name, that it takes
place in the time period of flourishing Rome.
</P>
<P><B>game's description :</B></P>
<P>
The player slips into the role of a Roman town councilor with the task to
create a metropolis out of nearly nothing and in addition this metropolis
has to thrive economically and to advance culturally.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve this goal the player may choose from a wide range
of buildings. Besides dwelling-houses and industry right at the beginning
of the game there are several buildings wit different tasks such as arenas,
bathes, temples or barracks which you may erect in order to embellish the
city's look.
</P>
<P>
Not only the right choice of buildings but also the best place for them is
important because they have a limited field of activity. With the &nbsp;info
function&nbsp; you can determine which field fulfills the specific needs such as
water support, entertainment or security best. Furthermore you can check if
a lack of one of these needs handicaps the growth and the development of
one of those fields.
</P>
<P>
Sim City like you build something by click'n'drag: the building's type can
be chosen in the menu and by dragging the mouse you can place it with
variable size. This way you can easily erect city walls because
automatically the shortest route between the point of beginning and the
point of ending is chosen.
</P>
<P>
Even the most enthusiastic house builder is going to get to the end of his
motivation and for this case Caesar II also offers a province mode. Cities
may be connected to each other, battles can be hold and you may expand on a
whole new level. Unfortunately the demo version only offers the city mode so
I have to guess that the province mode raises motivation additionally.
</P>
<P>
The game's graphics are considerable, you will take a pleasure in the
buildings' diversity and representation and there has been an affectionate
care for details. Only the sound is a little bit monotonous in my opinion
but you may deactivate it in the menu.
</P>
<P><B>game's speed :</B></P>
<P>
It's pleasing that you hardly recognize that the game is set upon an emulation.
It supports a PPC but probably only the animated sequences which you can find
in the full version benefit from that option. Altogether the swift gameplay is
convinving.
</P>
<P><B>results :</B></P>
<P>
Even in the demo version the game is very convincing. People who just want to
build a city out of nothing quickly will soon realize that there are some
strategical obstacles.
</P>
<P>
If there are no weaknesses in the full version which are missing in the demo
then I can really recommend the game.

<H2>The Dig</H2>
<TABLE><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#e0e0e0"><PRE>
name of the game: The Dig
manufacturer    : Lucas Arts
requirements    : ?
available at    :

basis of testing: ( ) full version     (X) demo     (X) other: Mac magazine
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>introduction:</B></P>
<P>
Besides cult games such as &nbsp;Day of the Tentacle&nbsp; or &nbsp;Full Throttle&nbsp; Lucas
Arts is also responsible for &nbsp;The Dig&nbsp;. I'd like to mention before the review
that it does justice to the high expectations.
</P>
<P><B>game's description:</B></P>
<P>
As you might guess when hearing the manufacturers name &nbsp;The Dig&nbsp; is a
ponit&click adventure so you can move your playing character easily by
clicking and let it act easily as well. The first thing which you may realize
is the fact that there's no command bar. It has been replaced by intelligent
actions being performed corresponding to the object cliked at.
</P>
<P>
The story, which is being told in an animated and spoken introduction: A
giant asteroid is going to collide with the earth. NASA veteran Brink (whose
role you play) and two experts try to prevent this catastrophe with a shuttle
and two nuclear warheads. Examining the asteroid they find out that it is
hollow - and that the human intruders are not the first ones who visit this
place.
</P>
<P>
Knowing that it's up to you to play. You have to explore the secrets of the
celestial body walking through an atmospheric drawn landscape. As time passes
the plot becomes very exciting and dynamic. Even the brief demo makes you want
to go on playing.
</P>
<P>
The Mac magazine praises the pompous game's soundtrack. Unfortunately it's
recommended to switch it of when using slow machines because there are lot's
of nasty interruptions.
</P>
<P><B>game's speed :</B></P>
<P>
Even on my 040/40 without a graphics board you can play fairly well. The
cut scenes should be watched in a small window and the music stammers
slightly but the gameplay is fluid if you don't mind a certain non-fluid
scrolling.
Presently some cursor errors (as found in all old Lucas Arts games) disturb a
little bit but. If you want to avoid them then you should upgrade to Fusion
V3.2 soon.
</P>
<P><B>results :</B></P>
<P>
The worst thing about tha game is that you will struggle to get it because of
its age; perhaps you can find a second-hand one. I'd definitely spend a certain
amount of money to get my hands on the original version.
</P>
<P>
results in Mac magazine: 5/5    &nbsp;Exciting, tricky, made with love.&nbsp;
