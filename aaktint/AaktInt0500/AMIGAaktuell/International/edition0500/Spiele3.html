<H2>3. Preface</H2>
<P><B>Hello, dear reader!</B></P>
<P>
Welcome, to a new edition of the AMIGA aktuell game section. The main events of the last month can be summarized with
one sentence: Heretic II demo version was released. Much more did not happen. Of course, you can read a preview of
Heretic II in this months edition, even if it just a kind of pseudo preview. I could not write a real one, because I
don't own a PPC board. So I was in various chat rooms and wrote down the experiences of their users. Please report your
experiences with the demo version of Heretic II. They will be published in the next edition.

Another interesting news of this month was the result of Hyperion Software after their first business year. So, this
company could manage it do port some industrial standards of the PC world to the Amiga, which simplifies porting of
PC games. I think, this is a very important step. So, Hyperion Software created the complete basis for new games.
Let's wait and see, what will come.

At last, there is a new PD test from Heiko Garrelts. This time it is about Star Trek. Of course, the Mac corner is
also included, but we have to say goodbye to the charts of the games section. Anyone of you might have noticed, that
nothing has changed since September. But this is not due to my carelessness, but somehow GTI doesn't publish any new
charts. Either on their homepage nor on the AmigaPlus homepage, which leads to the homepage of the AmigaOS. I don't
want to include user charts, because they would show me, how many people read the games section. Even, if AMIGA
aktuell (the German version) is spread widely, I expect not more than 20 readers of the games section. Because I get
nearly no feadback; maybe one mail per month. There is also no feedback on questions, requests. Anyway, I can understand
this behavior. It is very likely, that I wouldn't read the games section, if I didn't write it, because the games market
was quite unattractive for the last years and this raises from month to month. Sad, but true.

<P>
However, have fun reading the games section!
