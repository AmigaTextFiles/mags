<H2>1. Phase5 insolvency procedure cancelled for lack of assets </H2>
<P>
Amiga-News.de got a letter from the lawyer office Amend, which says, that the insolvency of Phase 5 digital products has
been cancelled ue to a lack of assets. This means, that there were not enough assets to clarify the claims of the
creditors. It is very likely, that those users, who paid in advance for a PowerPC board from Phase 5, will not get
anything for their money.
</P>
<P>
This is the translated letter:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;On April 19, 2000 the insolvency procedure Phase 5 Nr. 61 IN 18/00 of the district court Bad Homburg (Germany)
was cancelled due to a lack of assets.
</P>
<P>
This means, that the lawyer office Amend (which was temporary responsible for the insolvency management) is no longer
contact for eventual claims.
</P>
<P>
Eventual claims have to be asserted to the former owners Wolf Dietrich and Gerald Karda, Phase5 digital products,
In der Aue 27, D-61140 Oberursel.
</P>
<P>
Remark of the Amiga-News.de editors: Unfortunately were didn't find any method to contact Wolf Dietrich or Gerald Karda
diretly to ask them, if there is hope for the users from their point of view, who sent their devices to Phase5 for repair.
If anyone is able to establish contact, we would be happy about an official statment, because we think, that many users
would be happy about clarification.&#171;
