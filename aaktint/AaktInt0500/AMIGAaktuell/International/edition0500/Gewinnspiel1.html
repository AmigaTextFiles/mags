<H1>The AMIGA-aktuell International competition</H1>
<H2>1. Results of the last competition</H2>
<P>
Unfortunately the participation of last months' competition was not satisfying. Just 22 readers sent their answers.
Come on, pull yourself together and participate! The questions aren't that difficult and there are nice prizes to
be won.
</P>
<P>
Remember: Even if you don't know the answer of the master question. You participate, if you answer the other two
questions.
</P>
<P><B>But now, the solution:</B></P>

Some participants commented their answer of the question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Georg Breitsprecher says: &raquo;Let's say &quot;quite positive&quot;... even if I don't think much about those new
announcement. Let's wait and see, what the results will be...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Harald Nilgen writes: &raquo;Ich hope, that Amiga does it and is able to enlarge their community. I hope that for the
really great computer and the attached community.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Aichinger means: &raquo;The choice of the developer platform has a quite bitter after taste, but it seems to
be the correct decision.
</P>
<P>
At least, Bill had the tact not to use a CPU from Intel and not to run Elate on Windows in that machine. I am not
euphoric anymore. I lost this at Escom and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
I just wait and see what the result will be. Honestly, I don't mind, if I get hardware from Amiga or not. The important
thing is, that the men (and of course women) of Amiga don't destroy, what I understand of an Amiga: &quot;The feeling
to be a member of a really exclusive club&quot; and to work with a computer, which, apart of its old age, can surprise
me positive.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Joerg Gesen evaluates the announcement &quot;very positive, at last there's something happening. If it is useful or not,
it's better than doing nothing!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Klaus Moddemann has a similar opinion: &raquo;I think, the announcements made on the show in St. Louis show, that they
do something. It just can become for better, after we were tricked by Gateway and others. I think very positive about
the AMIGA future and hope to have a new system standing on my desktop, soon.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Ren&eacute; Thol has a different opinion: &raquo;Unfortunately I have to say, that the announcements don't impress me
positive, because there were only announcements without consequences during the last years (apart from OS3.5, which
I think is great). This made me sceptical!!!! In addition I miss a contact address for normal questions on the
new Amiga homepage, so I picked some eMail addresses and mailed to them. Now, I am waiting for an answer!
I hope, that I can bring my A4000 on G3 this year, if <A HREF="mailto:met@box">met@box</A> speeds up!!! Unfortunately
there are some uncertain things (about the 68k emulation)!
I have the same question about the new Amiga: Will the old software be supported (I don't want to lose all my software,
just because a new box!) [There shall be an emulation for the current Amiga programs; remark of the editor] resp. how
will the support for the current Amiga models look like?? [The new OS is supposed to be released for current Amigas
with PPC board; remark of the editor]&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Thomas Mitzschke does not give up hope for a new computer: &raquo;I have been hoping for a new AMIGA for years, maybe
on Christmas, when people spent their money more easily.
</P>
<P>
Well, it should also be a new AMIGA last year - made me save much money.
</P>
<P>
And this year?? Maybe McEwen and Fleecy Moss are more lucky and understand, what the AMIGA community wants.
</P>
<P>
I personally don't want to hear the moaning, that another fine AMIGA announcement was not realized, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
Christmas 2000 - A new AMIGA under the Christmas tree?
And if not, the old one has to work for another year.
</P>
<P>
I will use my AMIGA to the last and will not give up hope.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Result: Most readers are a bit optimistic about the announcement of AMIGA. A minority thinks even very positive about
them, while nearly no Amiga user dislikes the plans.
</P>
<P>
But now, the winners of the last competition:
