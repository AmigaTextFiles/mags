<H2>2. Comment on the conclusion to the Competition in Edition 2/2001 (by Gernod Schomberg)</H2>
<P>
In the assessment of the answers to the question of opinion for the competition in
February 2001 (&quot;Will you visit the CeBIT?&quot;) Carsten Schroeder wrote in conclusion:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;I was quite surprised at the low interest in CeBIT among participants. Not just because
of the possible presentation of the first AmigaDE products this year, but because I had
thought  that the biggest fair in the world would have a high positional value among
Amiga users, too. But this seems to be a misjudgment, perhaps because CeBIT has more and
more gained the image of a &quot;Professional Fair&quot; over the last few years.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
I believe, Carsten, I do have to defend us, the seemingly uninterested.
</P>
<P>
Certainly we do not stay away because of indifference, no more than the &quot;Professional
Fair&quot; image discourages us. But it is the sheer size of the whole event. If something
like this happened on a more comprehensible scale, I would go there, as I do to the much
smaller and moderate Amiga fairs.
</P>
<P>
In Hannover there are 25 to 30 halls, more than 8000 exhibitors vying for attention. If
you stay the whole week (this a private visitor cannot afford anyway), you would have to
visit more than one hundred exhibitors per hour! Does this make any sense? Just over
half-a-minute for each exhibitor?
</P>
<P>
So I'd rather try to read the surveys offered in the papers and switch on or record the
special transmissions on TV. There are teams busy, which were able to prepare for the
most important objects. If I went there, I probably would not even find the Thendic
booth!

[Well, I should not see as the meaning and the purpose of a visit to the CeBIT trying to
look at all the exhibitors, but just those which are of (especially high) interest to the
visitor. And as long as their number is not too high, in my opinion this can easily be
done in one day at the show. It is the unique charm of the CeBIT that nearly all the
renowned computer companies are present at a single event; Note of the editor-in-chief]
