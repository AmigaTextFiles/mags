<H1>Final thoughts</H1>
<H2>AMIGA again changes its course (by Carsten Schroeder)</H2>
<P>
I did not expect wonders from the show at St. Louis. I firmly believed that AMIGA's
prevailing strategy, which I agreed with and still believe to be the gold standard, would
be developed consistently. But everything has changed.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, I am lost for words about the future of the Amiga DE, because I gained
the impression that the three most important people at AMIGA, Bill McEwen, Fleecy Moss
and Gary Peake, speak about three different projects when they describe the AmigaDE.
According to Bill McEwen's statements, the planning of AmigaDE has changed radically: he
mentioned only PDAs and other small devices as well as &raquo;Content&laquo;.
</P>
<P>
What is heard from Fleecy Moss sounds much less dramatic, and Gary Peake says: &quot;There is
no change at all&quot;.
</P>
<P>
So what is going on? I simply cannot tell if those three are just talking about different
aspects of the same design, or if there is a change of planning for AmigaDE behind all of
this - and I am definitely not the only one who feels like this.
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is my opinion that the change of course, which - at least this is a a matter
of fact - was ushered in with the announcement of a PowerPC native version of the
AmigaOS, was a serious mistake by AMIGA.
</P>
<P>
Resources will be used up on another completely new operating system - a PowerPC native
AmigaOS version can be nothing else - which I cannot see has any chance in the market.
Who, please, needs to buy this OS?
</P>
<P>
So far I have not been able to discover a single feature so  extraordinary that users of
other operating systems would be induced to change to PowerPC AmigaOS. We ignore at our
peril that most users work with an x86 machine and are not prepared to buy an obviously
more expensive PowerPC computer, upon which in an emergency - say, the PowerPC AmigaOS
failed - they could not even install the Windows standard.
</P>
<P>
And given that consideration, why would a software producer port programs for the PowerPC
AmigaOS?
</P>
<P>
In short: I am very pessimistic about the chances of the planned PowerPC native AmigaOS.
Though we are told the AmigaOS will get Memory Protection starting with version 5 and be
&quot;merged&quot; with the AmigaDE, for me this begs the question: &quot;How?&quot;. Remember that memory
protection software was announced for the 68k AmigaOS several years ago, realization of
which finally proved impossible. And the merging of two operating systems could likewise
lead to serious problems.
</P>
<P>
Personal conclusion: Before St. Louis AMIGA pursued a simple, but ingenious idea: With
AmigaDE an operating system was to be created which offered platform independence at the
binary level, hence being able to run upon nearly all processors (and even hosted on
extraneous operating systems), but nevertheless fast.
</P>
<P>
The latest announcements of a PowerPC AmigaOS, which some day and somehow will be
combined with the AmigaDE, sound to me anything but well thought out and raise lots of
questions concerning realization. The past - and here especially the example of BeOS,
certainly not a bad product, and for some time now distributed free of charge - has shown
that an operating system can stay in the market only if it really has unrivalled
features. With best intentions I cannot see the particular appeal of the planned PowerPC
AmigaOS.
</P>
<P>
Whether in the future I'll be able to believe in a &raquo;New Amiga&laquo;  will mainly depend on
whether the AmigaDE is realized in the way it was planned originally. If this does not
happen, and AmigaDE only serves as a content supplier for PDAs and handheld devices, and
not realized as a scalable, platform independent operating system, before long I'll have
to rethink my commitment to the Amiga. Because without a view of the future I'll not have
any motivation.
