<H2>3. Software test: Benchmark Program &raquo;AmiGOD&laquo; (by Uwe Pannecke)</H2>
<P><B>Get set, Benchmark, Go!</B></P>
<P>
Benchmarks are a popular diversion when using an operating system, and AmigaOS is no
exception. Most computer magazines cater for this compulsion and publish at least one of
these tests per edition. If the computer in question is Windows based, the
famous/infamous Ego-Shooters or MadOnion's 3DMark 2000 are used. But the Amiga, too, can
point to quite a few examples of this kind of program, even though the graphics are a bit
more moderate. Just think of programs like AIBB, PowerMeter, SysSpeed or P96Speed. An
Amiga-user can benchmark until the men with white coats are called.
</P>
<P><B>AmiGOD</B></P>
<P>
A fairly recent representative of this brand of program is AmiGOD [1] by the Czech Lukas
Stehlik [2]. The version 1.43 Millennium from December 12, 2000 was put through its
paces.
</P>
<H3>1. System Requirements</H3>
<P>
AmiGOD is quite moderate. If there are at least 200 KB RAM available and AmigaOS 3.0 or
better is running, the program should run, on a 68k CPU alone or together with a PPC as
co-calculator.
</P>
<P>
AmiGOD refers to the identify.library for information about the Amiga, therefore this
should reside in the LIBS: directory. If not, it's no mishap at all, Lukas Stehlik
includes an applicable version in his program archive.
</P>
<H3>2. Installation</H3>
<P>
Installation is a simple as the system requirements are modest. After uncompressing the
LHA archive just move the drawer &quot;AmiGOD&quot; to the required position in the jungles of your
HD, and that's it.
</P>
<A HREF="img/AmiGOD1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AmiGOD1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
<P>
You can preset the language in the tooltypes (beside English there are adaptations in
German, Czech, French, Italian and Polish languages provided) and a custom font including
a variable size for those higher screen resolutions.
</P>
<H3>3. Test Run</H3>
<P>
The obligatory mouse-doubleclick upon the program icon reveals the main window. In this
the user gets a first overview of the hardware and operating system of his Amiga. Here he
may accept the reports of the identify.library about among other things CPU, FPU, MMU,
graphics chipset, Chip and Fast RAM, Kickstart and Workbench versions. Similar to several
other contestants a comment about the supposed performance of the recognized Amiga is
related.
</P>
<P>
A small menu provides access to additional functions of the program. Under
&quot;AmiGOD/Database&quot; is quite a collection of benchmark results of very different Amiga
configurations allowing a more or less edifying comparison with your own results. The
menu option &quot;AmiGOD/Test&quot; opens the actual benchmark.
</P>
<A HREF="img/AmiGOD2.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AmiGOD2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
<P>
A total of twelve different categories are ready for choice. This is, compared with other
current competitors a more moderate number. Beside selection/deselection of single test
steps a button enables the test run itself to be started. Immediately AmiGOD takes over
the Amiga and disables multitasking. No matter what screen resolution is set at the
Amiga, AmiGOD keeps a test window size of 320x240 pixels.
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes all test steps are done and AmiGOD presents the results. The gentle
user may add the results to the database, but only if he has previously filled the boxes
with his personal data.
</P>
<A HREF="img/AmiGOD3.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AmiGOD3.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
<P>
Whether you add your results to the database or not, you of course can view the existing
entries. Two examinees share the display and present their results. Beside the actual
test results, clicking the &quot;i&quot; button reveals the hardware configuration of that Amiga
including the selected screen resolution and colour depth. Because there are nearly 60
entries, there should be a worthy &quot;opponent&quot; for your own Amiga.
</P>
<P>
Under &quot;UAE-JIT Ipswich Town&quot;, too, AmiGOD was persuaded to cooperate without problems.
Host-computer in this case was an AMD Athlon with 600 MHz, 128 MByte RAM, a GeForce-2-GTS
graphics board and installed SuSE Linux 7.1.
</P>
<A HREF="img/AmiGOD4.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/AmiGOD4.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="82" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
<P>
Only the identify.library was not able to recognize the virtual Amiga properly, something
observed with other benchmark programs, and offered the (amusing) advice to speed up the
Amiga by purchasing a better CPU board. But the test run itself revealed, that even an
Amiga1200-060/50 with CyberVision64/3D and a lower resolution of 1024x768x16 is inferior
to the emulated Amiga under UAE in the benchmark.

<P>
The custom font selection is realised only half-heartedly. The selected font is not taken
into consideration in all program windows. Furthermore bigger fonts can have part of the
written information spill out of the provided editing area and become unreadable.
</P>
<H3>4. Net Result</H3>
<P>
Benchmarks should be accepted with a good grain of scepticism, and the whole system will
certainly not be characterized exhaustively by the results.
</P>
<P>
However, especially after the installation of new CPU or graphics hardware it is quite
some fun to see the gain of performance in black and white or whatever colour
combination.
</P>
<P>
AmiGOD worked its test program on all available configurations without any problems. Even
if it cannot keep up with the test span of SysSpeed and P96Speed, for a little test in
between it is always appropriate. :)
