                      Amiga show being held before long a &raquo;big surprise&laquo; will be

Several participants added comments to their answers to the question of opinion:
</P>
<P>
Krister Skrtic hopes &raquo;to learn some good news, especially about the OS3.9 BoingBag. Why
aren't there more often smaller updates instead waiting so long?&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Kai Tenbieg writes: &raquo;I very deeply hope, that Bill at last will bring the Amiga on to the
road of success. I am very curious whether Bill will suffer the same fate as his
predecessor, who has been ousted.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Stephan Kolbe shows little hope: &raquo;I expect scarcely anything, for it is my opinion that
AMIGA is not interested any more in its present users. For goodness sake, don't let it be
like this.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
A similar view appears to be held by Martin R. Elsner: &raquo;What kind of surprise can Bill
offer right now? At the most the announced extension boards for the Classic Amiga or a
new version of the AmigaDE, or a new Amiga ball-pen.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Rainer M. Herold states: &raquo;By and by I don't want to hear words any more but I want to see
actions! What I am missing most is a JVM on the Amiga and a browser at least able to do
JavaScript!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andre Beer is full of expectations: &raquo;I have very high expectations and I hope not to be
disappointed, because AMIGA Inc. would make itself really untrustworthy after such
boastful announcements.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Tim Moerbe has resigned: &raquo;In the meantime I have given up the hope for a new Amiga. For
years month by month I have put aside some money for this dream.
</P>
<P>
This has now become a Honda CBR 600 F - sorry AMIGA, I believe, I gave you a fair chance.
- Hello Nils - I have the bike.&laquo;
</P>

Christian Secker writes: &raquo;I hope the news will be super and at last the spirit of Amiga
will be back again.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg has not so high expectations, &raquo;but the higher hopes!&quot;&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Net Result:</B></P>
<P>
A few days ago the nervously awaited fair came off, and everybody will have their own
impressions of the announcements.
