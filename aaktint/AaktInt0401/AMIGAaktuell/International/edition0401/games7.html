<H2>7. Preview: Land of Genesis</H2>
<P>
Years after Turrican conquered the Amiga a clone is sold as a successor.
</P>
<P>
Crystal Interactive Software seem to be specialized on improving old game ideas. After
the success of &quot;Bubble Heroes&quot;, a clone of BubbleBobble, the latest is a Turrican style
game named &quot;Land of Genesis&quot;. Will the nostalgic feeling win or is the game idea too old?
</P>
<P>
Land of Genesis has lingered a bit longer under development after  being expected to be
released by Epic Marketing a year ago. Now, it is nearly ready and I had a look at the
demo version.
</P>
<P>
LoG requires an Amiga with 68020, AGA, 2 MByte Chip-RAM and 3 MByte Fast-RAM or better.
In addition you need a CD-ROM drive and at least 9 MByte of free hard disk space. But if
you want to watch all of the animations and enjoy extras like 512 colours, transparency,
extra backgrounds, extra parallax and the incredible artificial intelligence you should
have an 68040 with 8 MByte Fast-RAM and 80 MByte of free hard disk space. In addition
there are 12 audio tracks on the shiny disk as well as 45 seconds of rendered movie.
Well, that's the bare numbers.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/log1.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/log1.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="77" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P>
But what about the story of Land of Genesis? Well, it seems that the developers spent
days on that. This is the background story in its original length: Land of Genesis plays
in the future. Some genetically altered humans, which are the result of a secret
experiment, got control over the bases on Mars where the experiments took place. Jan has
to go to Mars to kill those monstrous creatures. This is no longer the background story,
that's me again. That's it!
</P>
<P>
But actually the story does not matter - let's start the demo version. The title graphics
are phantastic.
</P>
<P>
The demo version starts with the usual fadein of the logos. This has been well made. The
option screen looks more than good. It was done by a good renderer. Unfortunately there
is no intro except some screenshots, but it promises to be good. And so, full of
expectations, I start my first game.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the graphics cannot fulfil the promise of the title graphics. Although it
is well done and could have been a hit some years ago, because there is real parallax
scrolling, animated backgrounds in incredible colors and transparency effects, but
unfortunately this is not enough for anyone due to the current technology.
</P>
<P>
The sound effects also don't follow my idea of &quot;creating atmosphere&quot;. But a real
soundtrack is to follow, which might create more atmosphere. In the end LoG is a well
done piece of software, but users of a high end Amiga especially should first play the
demo version and check if they like the a bit old fashioned technology. Those of you who
own a middle class Amiga and have a &quot;Turrican&quot; tattoo on the butt can order it without
any hesitation. There is more than enough action.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Five worlds with some of them divided into sublevels and 180(!) different opponents
should not bore. Before you enter a new world you have to win a battle against a Level
finish opponent, which is not weak at all. Also shooter elements &amp;agrave; la Katakis are
built into Land of Genesis. So you can remove the fingers from the fire buttons after you
lost all of your lives or you liberated Mars.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I will keep you informed. And if it follows the plans of the developers you will
find an article on this page. But also the (German magazine) Amiga Future (where this
article was printed first) will report about the game.
