<H2>2. First BoingBag-Update for AmigaOS 3.9 released</H2>
<P>
Amiga Inc. and Haage&amp;Partner simultaneous with the fair in St. Louis announced the
availability of BoingBag 1 for AmigaOS 3.9. The update may be downloaded at
<A HREF="http://www.amiga.com/3.9/download/BoingBag39-1.lha" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com/3.9/download/BoingBag39-1.lha</A>. Here are the the new features and
bugfixes:
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;BoingBag 1 for AmigaOS3.9</B></P>
<HR>
<H3>Contents of Update</H3>
<H3>Internet Software</H3>
<P>
GenesisPrefs now has a ReAction interface! The AWeb SE documentation has been
supplemented with information about plugins.
</P>
<H3>Harddisk use</H3>
<P>
HDToolBox now avoids the listing of several drivers, which are not harddisk drivers.
There are several bugfixes. In IoTools as well several bugs are repaired, and the
compatibility is improved.
</P>
<H3>Multimedia</H3>
<P>
There are new and improved ARexx commands for AMPlifier.
</P>
<H3>Improved shell and new and extended shell commands.</H3>
<P>
ViNCEd now permits selection of a single word with a double click. For experts:
It supports the logging by a CSI Sequenz. Additionally several bug-fixes.
</P>
<P>
WBRun makes it possible to start programs in Workbench mode out of the shell or from a
script. SetEnv has a &quot;SAVE&quot; option. When selected, the environment variable is saved not
only to &quot;ENV:&quot; but as well to &quot;ENVARC:&quot;. MakeDir has an &quot;ALL&quot; option to create complete
directory paths. A bug in LoadResource is fixed and MakeLink has been written anew.
</P>
<H3>Workbench and Workbench Accessories</H3>
<P>
AsyncWB adds asynchronous copying and deleting of files and directories to the Workbench,
which has long been waited for. The windows &quot;New Drawer&quot; and &quot;Rename&quot;, too, no longer
block the Workbench.
</P>
<P>
UnArc now permits the selection of files which are to be dearchived. Find supports the
saving of its own window position and size and now works with a directory with an
underscore in its name. Furthermore search paths can be added simply by drag&amp;drop or
pull-down menus.
</P>
<P>
RAWBInfo was improved, too: A mouse-click on an icon tooltype with shift-key pressed
enables or disables this tooltype. When you drag icon tooltypes from one information
window to another, you can add them by holding down the shift key instead of replacing
them.
</P>
<P>
BenchTrash now is able to work asynchronously and to replace the delete function of the
Workbench. AnimatedIcon again works as it is supposed to.
</P>
<H3>ReAction Classes</H3>
<P>
The ReAction classes responsible for the display of ReAction surfaces are completely
reworked, resulting in an optimized view, many bug-fixes and several new features.
</P>
<H3>Several Bug-Fixes</H3>
<P>
The FontCache will be automatically activated after the BoingBag installation.
xadmaster during depacking no longer will replace spaces with underscores.
Now rexxmathlib.library is contained. And much more ...
</P>
<H3>Contribution</H3>
<P>
A big &quot;Thank You!&quot; goes to everybody who contributed to AmigaOS 3.9. More contributions
will be found at &quot;ftp.amiga.com&quot; in directory &quot;OS3.9&quot;.
