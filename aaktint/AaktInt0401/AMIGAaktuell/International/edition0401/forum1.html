<H2>1. Reaction upon the OS3.9 commentary by M. Christoph (by Stephan Kolbe)</H2>
<br>
&lt; My personal view: I've been a beta tester since AmigaOS 3.5 and have<BR>
&lt; watched the many tweaks that have been done deep in the heart of the os,<BR>
&lt; many of which are not obvious from the outside.<BR>
<P>
If only someone would talk about it, it is of interest to most people what was improved
internally since OS3.5 or 3.9. Nobody, and as well nobody of the official ranks believes
it necessary to enlighten the users, hence the people which would or should give their
money for it!!!
</P>
<P>
The HTML docs are, let's call it like this, just a joke, and if, as I heard, very much is
written about this in the OS3.9 book, then this means that you have to buy it as well.
</P>
&lt; In spite of all that, I believe PPC-AmigaOSes are not required and don't<BR>
&lt; help the AmigaDE.<BR>
<P>
If there ever will be an AmigaDE, or if it will be of use to the present Amiga users.
</P>
&lt; Not only will it take a (wasted as far as I can see) year for development,<BR>
&lt; but there could still be compatibility problems with the classic os.<BR>
&lt; Compatibility would be better suited to an emulator as far as speed is<BR>
&lt; concerned, freeing up time for much-needed improvement and corrections<BR>
&lt; that will benefit everyone and not just a small group of classic users.<BR>
<P>
I think your opinion is completely correct, but I doubt that at least AMIGA will ever let
anything happen about this.
</P>
<P>
They should open the source and let the users do it, if it does not pay for a commercial
enterprise, which is what the aim to be.
</P>
<P>
By the way, I have a positive slant to the OS3.9, may you call it
BoingBag 2 or version 39 or what ever ....
