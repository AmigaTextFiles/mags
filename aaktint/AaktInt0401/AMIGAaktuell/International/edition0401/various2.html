<H2>2. News from Airsoft Softwair</H2>

<P>
&raquo;Rainboot v3.2 was just released on the Airsoft Softwair homepage. This update offers now
better support for graphics boards, OS 3.9 support and it is more user friendly. Rainboot
v3.2 is currently only available for owners of the The Best Of Airsoft Softwair Gold
Edition CD-ROM. Owners of this CD-ROM can log into the update section with their serial
code.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;Some users of the The Best Of Airsoft Softwair Gold Edition CD-ROM informed me that the
CD-ROM also boots on a CD32 and asked if I planned that. Well, the The Best Of Airsoft
Softwair Gold Edition CD-ROM works on the CD32 with a nice intro indeed, but it cannot be
used completely without an expansion like the SX1 or SX32. If the user has such an
expansion he can use the CD-ROM completely otherwise only the intro is shown.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;A new theme for the NewInstaller was just released on the Airsoft Softwair homepage
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.airsoftsoftwair.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.airsoftsoftwair.com/</A>&gt;. The &quot;Spooky Theme&quot; was made by Kevin Hansen
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:kevoa@bellsouth.net">kevoa@bellsouth.net</A>&gt; and can be downloaded now. It requires at least NewInstaller
version 1.5, which is also contained as a full version on the The Best Of Airsoft
Softwair Gold Edition CD-ROM.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;The CD32 Games Install Kit v4.2 NG was just released on the Airsoft Softwair homepage.
In this version more games (like Dennis) can be installed and there were small
improvements (e.g. in the usage with OS3.9). Like all 4.x versions of the CD32 Games
Install Kit, this version can only be used by owners of the The Best Of Airsoft Softwair
Gold Edition CD-ROM. All users with a valid serial code, can log into the updates section
of the Airsoft Softwair homepage &lt;<A HREF="http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de/" TARGET="_top">http://www.airsoftsoftwair.de/</A>&gt; and download this
update.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
&raquo;For the program Updater, which is on the The Best Of Airsoft Softwair Gold Edition
CD-ROM and allows its users to access the updates section, is a new update it. It has the
improvement that the user doesn't need to enter his serial code every time he accesses
the updates section. The update can be downloaded from the update section of the Airsoft
Softwair homepage &lt;<A HREF="http://www.airsoftsoftwair.com/" TARGET="_top">http://www.airsoftsoftwair.com/</A>&gt;&laquo;
