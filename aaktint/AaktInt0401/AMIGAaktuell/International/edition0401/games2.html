<P><B>Dear Reader,</B></P>
<P>
The AMIGA aktuell international Games section needs your help, this is why I
ask you to inform me, if you have news about games. I am always interested in
news, tips or whatever, if it has something to do with Amiga and games. Critics
is also welcome, please tell me, if there's something you don't like. Because I
am not perfect, either. So - just give me your ideas.
</P>
<P><B>Dear Programmers and Software firms,</B></P>
<P>
now, where there are just a few suitable publications, informing about AMIGA
games, it is even more important, to use any remaining possibility, to bring
the new, previews and tests to the loyal AMIGA fans. I think, that AMIGA
aktuell is a good one of these possibilities. With its extremely great number
of ways of distribution it is expected to have some thousands of potential
readers. It is up to you, if you support me and my work and your games are well-
known. Please send me news regarding your games, as well as demo versions. I
would also be happy about samples of your games. This would be honoured by an
extended test of your game.
</P>
