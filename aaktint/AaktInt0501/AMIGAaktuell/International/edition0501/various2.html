Boing Bag #1 for OS 3.9</H3><BR>
</P>
<P>
In time for the Gateway Computer Show Amiga 2001 AMIGA. Inc. and H&amp;P presented the Boing
Bag #1 for OS 3.9. The most interesting function certainly is AsyncWB, which allows the
asynchronous copying and deleting of files on the WorkBench. Additionally there are: new
GenesisPrefs, reworked HDToolBox, Amplifier, ViNCEd, WBRun, UnArc, RAWBInfo, BenchTrash
and several more improvements.
</P>
<P>
Addendum: In the meantime there is a new version (5.254.174 Bytes) of the Boing Bag #1,
which contains several small changes:
new versions of Blanker, CrossDOS, Exchange and FKey, reworked German locale for
IconEdit.

STL for StormC 4</H3><BR>
</P>
<P>
Raymond Zarling has ported the Standard Template Library (STL) for StormC 4.
</P>
<P>
This library is an extensive collection of algorithms and data structures, which can very
much facilitate the creation of programs. It is also defined as part of the recent C++
standard. The Amiga sources can be found on the Aminet, the original sources are on
stlport.org and the documentation you can find on sgi.com.
