<H2>5. Review: DYNAMITE - bombing deluxe! (by R&uuml;diger Gr&uuml;newald)</H2>
<P>
We all know that every now and then we are going to have to resist the urge to take up
bomb, mine or flamethrower and kill a really irritating neighbor. Unfortunately big
brother is watching and we all decide the time in pokey isn't really worth it.
</P>
<P>
But if you have a computer at home - Dynamite be blessed - you don't have to pass up the
chance to put bombs under their evil backsides - in cyberspace. Without all the usual
repercussions!
</P>
<P>
DYNAMITE is a clone of the popular and well known Bomberman idea. Bomberman was developed
in the mid 80's and fast became a cult game spawning addiction problems similar to
Pac-Man, Tetris and the games of the Super Mario-series. In 1989 an official
amiga-conversion appeared called &quot;Dynablasters&quot;. On its heels followed the shareware
program &quot;BlitzBombers&quot; .
</P>
<P>
Dynamite and its forefathers have a simple premise: Wander in a labyrinth where it is
your goal to kill your opponent with high-explosive bombs.
</P>
<P>
The labyrinth consists of strong walls that cannot be destroyed by bombs, and less strong
walls that break down after a detonation in the neighbourhood. Behind these walls from
time to time the laws of reality are suspended: for example more bombs can be laid at the
same time, the range of a detonation can be increased, the player can run much faster,
can be teleported to another position in the labyrinth, or can catch an opponent by using
a remotable bomb. And when megatonnes are not enough, flamethrowers to roast the foe may
be found in the extensive weapons repertoire of Dynamite. Of course there are also
&quot;negative&quot; extras, for example one which reverses the controls completely.
</P>
<P>
Most of the elderly Bomberman-Clones have a more or less boring one-player-mode, with
boring computer-controlled sprites walking through the labyrinth. Dynamite blows off the
one-player-mode and looks to the multi-player experience via the internet. The game
becomes fast moving, needing a lot of strategic thought even against human opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Dynamite download archive can be decompressed to a harddisc partition but does not
contain all the necessary program files. The potential explosives expert has to download
the &quot;amarquee.library&quot; and &quot;identify.library&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
At first start, Dynamite the game presents itself on workbench. With a high screen
resolution, the graphics look a bit shrivelled but appear in the familiar bomberman
outlook. Thanks to MUI, Dynamite may be brought to a lower resolution.
</P>
<P>
There are different graphic sets available. When you tire of the original bomberman
graphics you can try the Simpsons-family or even an Boing!-bombs laying Bill McEwen.
</P>
<P>
Before gamestart you have to connect to the internet. You can only explode when you are
online. All working Dynamite-Servers are found automatically, and there are no further
hurdles to enjoy the addictive pleasure. Those of you who have to worry about online
costs should be warned!!
</P>
<P>
As a bonus Dynamite includes a chat-function. During short breaks between matches one can
trade insults with gamers from all around the world. With a flatrate, your Amiga can
become a Dynamite server on the internet.
</P>
<P>
Dynamite doesn't need a highend amiga. A system with a 68020-processor and AGA-chipset is
enough, but to enjoy the game you should have at least an 68030 and a gfx-card. Dynamite
requires 2MB Chip and 4MB Fastmem to provide a smashing Dynamite-feeling.
</P>
<P>
Negatives are hard to find in Dynamite. Ok, the sound is a bit thin. But as Dynamite is a
freeware-game, (no costs = big fun) we can live with it.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we'll meet sometimes for a competition on internet...
