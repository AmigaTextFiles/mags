<H2>2. Commentary about AMIGA's latest Change of Course (by Gernod Schomberg)</H2>
<P>
In AMIGA aktuell International 0401 Carsten Schroeder wrote in his &quot;Final words&quot;: &quot;AMIGA
again changes its course&quot; and explained his opinion in detail. I felt exactly like this
and fully agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
I have an A4000T, without any acceleration, without a graphics board, because for me
video-processing was important, which at that time no other machine could handle to a
similar standard. A graphics board would have been inconvenient for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately memory expansion is only possible up to 16 MBytes, but there are few
situations when this is not sufficient. I did not buy a PPC board, because the
PowerUP/WarpUP quarrel smelled fishy to me.
I do not have a PC of recent make!
</P>
<P>
After the announcement one year ago, with AmigaDE to create a system which would run on
the, unfortunately it must be expressed like this, current standard computers, namely x86
based PCs, and that a computer of this type would be developed by other companies as the
new Amiga, I hoped this year to put my aged A4000T to rest.
</P>
<P>
You may like Windows, or not, but it is a fact that today most programs are developed for
that system and with such a computer, able to run any system, you would have access to
programs which cannot (yet) be bought in the kind or quality for the Amiga! And as
Carsten wrote, it would have been easy to convince users of other systems of the
simplicity and beauty of the AmigaOS.
</P>
<P>
And now there comes the statement by Bill McEwen that an operating system for a new
computer platform based on PPC will be developed! The new OS will not run on my computer,
certainly even would not run if I had installed an accelerator board, so I would need a
new computer!
</P>
<P>
Well, I saved the money I might have spent on a PPC or a graphics board. But the new one
will only run AmigaOS4.0 and would need appropriate programs. Today only &quot;aficionados&quot;
write programs for the Amiga and certainly cannot make a living out of this, so how many
programs can I expect for the new platform? There is only emulation of the old AmigaOS,
but nobody knows how well it will run. And new programs there will not be available, too.
</P>
<P>
The first statement has been modified in the meantime quite a bit, development for the
AmigaDE will proceed at full power, but the possibilities for AMIGA are quite limited.
</P>
<P>
I bought my first Amiga in 1989, then I was 64 years young. I am afraid that AMIGA now
suffers as I do, that time runs too fast for us! I can only hope with AMIGA, Inc., that
we both will catch sight of an universal computer with AmigaDE during the lifetime of
both of us!
