<H1>News about AmigaNG</H1>
<H2>1. Executive Update by AMIGA-CEO Bill McEven</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Executive Update</B></P>
<P><B>Bill McEwen - April 12, 2001</B></P>
<P><B>Greetings to one and all:</B></P>
<P>
What a wonderful time it was for us in St. Louis. I must thank our hosts Bob and Diana
Scharp and all of the members of the Gateway Amiga Club. They once again outperformed and
kept things rolling.
</P>
<P>
I want to make very clear what the announcements were and what it means for Amiga and the
rest of the Amiga Family.
</P>
<P>
Amiga has made NO change in strategy with AmigaDE. Things are going great, as expected,
and we have some impressive new customers; Sharp being the first.
</P>
<P>
Amiga OS 4.0 and beyond was announced. This is a staged series of releases that will
bring a native port of the AmigaOS to the PPC. This is NOT about WarpOS, vs. anybody. It
is an Amiga Inc. port of the OS. You may infer nothing else from this.
</P>
<P>
AmigaOne A1200 is the first new hardware, for the Amiga, and we are still planning a
standalone ATX board and other new pieces of hardware. AmigaOne for the A1200 will be out
this summer. We are then looking at releases later in the year, for the new standalone
designs.
</P>
<P><B>Summary:</B></P>
<P>
AmigaDE doing great and on target with the goals that we set forth and we will continue
development efforts.
</P>
<P>
AmigaOS 4.0 out this summer with the first of the AmigaOne Zico specification machines.
Sharp is a new partner of Amiga Incorporated. More will soon be released about our
relationship. There will be more partners and more announcements soon.
</P>
<P>
This is a great time to be part of the Amiga Family. For more in-depth information check
out the new Technical Update. I thank you all for your support and look forward to a very
exciting year before us!
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
Bill McEwen, and the rest of the team at Amiga, Inc.&laquo;
