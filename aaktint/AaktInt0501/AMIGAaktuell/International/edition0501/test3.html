<H2>3. Softwaretest: PowerMac-Emulator &raquo;iFusion&laquo; (von Jochen Abitz)</H2>
<P>
iFusion - The Powermac Emulator for Power Amigas
</P>
<P>
Ist took quite a long time , but it is finally here. It seems mainly because of the
pressure from customers, because it is still far from being completed. Yet before I start
listing what still needs to be done, lets look at what the current version does contain.
You get an attractive CD case and a CD - nothing more - nothing less. The fact that only
1MB of data is contained on the CD shouldn`t really be of any concern.
</P>
<P>
The installation is done via the standard installer. Within a few seconds it is installed
and awaiting configuration. For the configuration an installer script is also used, which
asks questions leading you step by step through the configuration. You also have the
option of configuring everything in a text editor. My configuration is as follows:

<P>
It shouldn`t be very difficult to modify this configuration to fit your own needs.
</P>
<P>
For the next step you require a MacOS CD (version 8.6 - 9.1are supported). On the MacOS
CD the is a System folder that contains the actual MAC Rom named &quot;Mac OS Rom&quot; which
simply needs to be copied to the ROM folder in the Fusion directory. In my case I renamed
it to &quot;rom_91&quot;
</P>
<P>
You then need to make the following ENV variable settings.
</P>
<UL>
<LI> In the directory Envarc:Powerpc the variable memprot must be set to 1
</LI>
<BR><LI> In the directory Envarc:Powerpc the variable EnAlignExc must be set to 1
  (Most of the time this doesn`t exist yet and needs to be created by hand.)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Then copy both of the WarpOS libraries from the iFusion CD to Libs:
</P>
<P>
In the config file the first device listed is the boot device. Therefore put the cd-rom
as the first device and then the hard disk partition (which needs to be amiga formatted).
Double click on Run_Fusion and the emulation will start.
</P>
<P>
The Mac will boot from the CD and after a few moments we can begin with the installation
of MacOS. If there is no previously formatted Mac partition you will be asked if you wish
to format the drive (the Amiga one defined above). After a few more clicks the
installation of MacOS is underway.
</P>
<P>
In my case - and also with others, the following happened. The sreen would go black, yet
the installation would still continue. The cd-rom accesses were evidence of that, there
was just nothing to see. Maybe the Mac goes into a stand-by mode. In any event one should
not press any keys. Just let it do its thing, until there is no activity left to be
heard. When this happens, press enter. The MAC can be forcably shut dow with the key
combination L-Amiga + Shift + ESC. Once you have successfully installed MacOS you will
need to change the config file one more time. The boot device is no longer the cd-rom,
but the hard drive partition. So, move this to the first device and start the emulation
again.
</P>
<P>
Once the Mac has booted, you can begin to configure the system and change the screen
resolution to a more accceptable one. The standard initial screenmode is 640x480x256.
</P>
<P>
Under the Applemenu/Control Panels/Extentions on/off you can also select the unneeded
system extensions and control panels. They just hog system resources. Currently you can
forget about networking, Firewire, graphics card drivers and cd-rom software. Reboot and
the Mac should be useing much less memory.
</P>
<P><B>Compatibility:</B></P>
<P>
The emulation is unbelievably compatible. Ich have not yet found a program the didn`t
run. I have tested Photoshop 5.5, Bryce 3, ITunes, IMovie (we really need Firewire on
Amigas), Norton Utilities 6, Tech Tools Pro 3, Corel Draw, Freehand 9, Actua Soccor,
Myth. A very diverse collection of software and it all ran.
</P>
<P><B>Speed:</B></P>
<P>
The emulation has the following short-comings that pushes the speed downward:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> No refreshed graphic drivers yet. Only a refresh driver will give an acceptable speed.
</LI>
<BR><LI> Disk access have to use the 68K/PPC bridge which mean many context switches are
</LI>
</UL>
generated. Setting the partitions buffers to 2000 helps offset this a bit.
<P>
The pure computing power is surprisingly high, when one takes into account what kind of
hardware the P5 powerup boards are. (no 2nd level cache). It nearly gets actual 604e
speed (see screenshot in comparision with a 8100 601).
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="img/speedometer.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/speedometer.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="90" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A>
</P>
<P><B>The following features are not yet finished:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI> SCSI support. Currently only block devices are accessable. Anything that uses direct
</LI>
</UL>
SCSI command can not yet be used (e.g. CD-rom burners and Toast)
<UL>
<LI> Mounting of Mac partitions on the Amiga side for data transfers. Those with a Zip drive
</LI>
</UL>
can mount that as a block device and do data tranfers that way.
<UL>
<LI> Sound support. The start sound works, but otherwise no sound is played at all.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Since Blittersoft has purchased the Amiga licence for iFusion, it remains to be seen if
these features and others will be implemented. Also an AmigaDE version (AmigaOS4.0?) is
supposed to be in development. That is hopefully the case, since the hardware that
currently is at the top of the line for the Amiga is hopelessly outdated for this OS. On
a new G3/G4 based Amiga it would be an entirely different story.

<P>
iFusion was tested by Jochen Abitz with the following Amiga configuration:
</P>
<P>
Amiga 4000 with CyberStormPPC 604e/200, 68060/50, CyberVisionPPC, 100 MB
Ram, 6 GB IDE-, 4,5 GB UW, 21&quot; Monitor, Serielle 4D Maus, IDE-CDRom 32-
fach, 32fach SCSI CDRom Teac, CDRW Philips CDD 3600, OS 3.9, 100 MB Zip
SCSI.
