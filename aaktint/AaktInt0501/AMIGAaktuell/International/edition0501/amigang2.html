<H2>2. Amiga releases an technical update</H2>
<P><B>&raquo;Technical Update Part 1 - 12 April 2001</B></P>
<P>
On the 31st of March, 2001 at the Amiga show held in St Louis, the Chairman and CEO of
Amiga, Mr Bill McEwen, unveiled the full Amiga strategy. While only pieces of it had come
out in the previous year, this was the first time that it was explained in detail and in
full.
</P>
<P>
That presentation was an intimate affair, given to the few hundred attendees at the show
banquet. This update now takes the information presented at the banquet and makes it
wholly available for the world.
</P>
<P>
The future is a content future. Information and activity is slowly migrating from the
physical and analog to the digital. Entertainment, research, work, shopping,
conversation, education; all are crossing over to take advantage of the digital universe.
</P>
<P>
Access to this digital universe is via any device that has a microprocessor, understands
the digital language, and can connect to that digital universe. In the past this was
limited to million dollar mainframes. As technology advanced, the universe became
accessible to two thousand dollar desktops. Today, technology has developed to such an
extent that this digital universe can be accessed from three hundred dollar games
consoles and one hundred dollar cellphones.
</P>
<P>
The user now has a huge choice when it comes to accessing the one constant; the digital
universe. They have the workstation, the desktop, the set top box, the games console, the
PDA, the cell phone. Which one they choose depends on many things - where they are, what
they want to do, what time it is. For Amiga, this is the new challenge, the new frontier,
the new WWW. Whatever, Whenever, Wherever.
</P>
<P>
All of these devices can access the digital universe, but each of them comes with a set
of capabilities decided by price, market and form factor. Each plays a part and fits into
a role that in the past defined the activity but which now describes only a profile. For
instance 'Desktop' used to be synonymous with word processing, image manipulation and web
browsing. Now those activities have escaped mere hardware to become activities in their
own right on many other devices.
</P>
<P>
These activities have a set of requirements; services that they require in order to take
place. Similarly, devices have a set of capabilities; services that they can offer to
allow activities to take place. Future digital environments will simply match activities
to devices based upon requirements and capabilities, scaling the activity up or down to
match the capabilities of the host device. Activities will be free of a particular type
or piece of hardware, and this will free users from the restrictions imposed on them by
the restriction inherent in that hardware.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly it will be the digital content and the digital activity itself that becomes
the only concern. This is a traditional sign that a technology is maturing, as the
underlying technology becomes invisible to the user. Digital Living will finally deliver
on its promise of Whatever, Whenever, Wherever.
</P>
<P>
Amiga intends to energize this transition through the creation of a revolutionary
product, the Amiga Digital Environment or AmigaDE. The AmigaDE will provide a universal
content layer that can sit on any digital device, irrespective of its hardware form or
component set, and give both users and developers (content consumers and content
producers) a common place in which to conduct digital activity.
</P>
<P>
AmigaDE offers the unique capability of being able to deploy itself either directly on
hardware, co-operatively on a software host (running just like another application on an
existing Operating System) or, uniquely, on a software host where the user only sees the
AmigaDE but takes advantage of the feature set of the software host.
</P>
<P>
For the user, the AmigaDE provides a brand new source of rich, compelling content;
everything from games through Internet adventures to productivity, content creation and
serious work. All of this available on any device that supports the AmigaDE thus not tied
to a specific device or computer type. The user gets freedom of choice handed back to
them. If they want to add the AmigaDE to their existing computer set up, they can. If
they want to use only the AmigaDE, they can.
</P>
<P>
The user chooses the activity they want to perform and the device on which they want to
perform that activity. The AmigaDE works to match activity requirements to device
capabilities and provides them with the optimum experience.
</P>
<P>
For the content producer, the AmigaDE offers a truly universal solution: Content can be
created only once and then distributed to any AmigaDE user, irrespective of the device
that they are using. As long as the device has the capabilities to support the content,
it will work. No more having to create different versions of the same content for
Windows, Macintosh and Linux. No more having a great product excluded from the new Set
Top Box and PDA markets. The AmigaDE provides a level playing field and brings a
multitude of smaller, separate markets into one common market with all the business
advantages and opportunities that this entails.
</P>
<P>
The AmigaDE is a true content environment, allowing users everywhere on every platform
and every device to enjoy great content. In the home, families can start to build
collections of content (everything from games and productivity applications to digital
movies, pictures, music and documentation) and access this content from any any of the
devices in their home, and ultimately from any device on the planet.
</P>
<P>
This content will be downloaded from the Internet or across satellite and cable channels,
or by good old fashioned CDs and DVDs and stored on the individual devices. However, as
the family collects more and more of this digital content, they may want to collect it
all together in a local digital repository, where it can be cataloged, protected and
shared amongst all their digital devices without the hassle of having to carry CDs or
DVDs between rooms or getting into a fight because eldest son is on the family computer
and mother only has the game console.
</P>
<P>
Amiga intends to solve this problem and thus provide a complete solution for Digital
Living, by offering yet another new product: the AmigaOS. This is a completely separate
product from the AmigaDE and is not needed in order to enjoy the wonderful benefits of
the AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
The AmigaOS, together with compliant hardware, will provide a product that will sit at
the heart of the digital home. As a repository, it will allow the family to store any
type of digital content that they chose, securely and easily accessed. As a server, it
will allow the family to move that content to any device within the digital home, and
beyond if they so desire, guaranteeing optimum delivery quality at all times. As a
gateway, it will provide a single source of entry for all digital content into the home,
providing protection from attacks and incursions, allowing parents to control access to
external content and consolidating all digital paths.
</P>
<P>
For the majority of digital families, the AmigaOS device will sit out of the way,
requiring minimum maintenance whilst quietly and efficiently enhancing their digital
experience. For those interested in a new level of multimedia experience however, the
AmigaOS device can also be used as a powerful computer in its own right, and it comes
with the additional advantage of the AmigaDE running co-operatively on it, providing
direct access to the content that it is also busy serving to other AmigaDE enabled
devices in the home.
</P>
<P>
The world is changing. The way people work, the way they play, the way they communicate,
the way they shop and the way they produce and consume. The very act of living itself is
moving forwards to a new age. Amiga understands this change; indeed, it has been at the
forefront of it since 1984 when it introduced the world to multimedia for the very first
time.
</P>
<P>
With its two new products, the AmigaDE and the AmigaOS, people no longer have to stumble
over incompatible products and disappointing content. On their own, these two products
offer outstanding performance and value for money. Together, they mark the beginning of
Digital Life.
</P>
<P>
For those interested in using an AmigaOS device as a computer, or for a more technical
explanation of the Amiga strategy, please check out Part 2 of the Technical Update.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>&raquo;Technical Update Part 2 - 12 April 2001</B></P>
<P>
The AmigaDE® and the AmigaOS® are the two products offered by Amiga to allow for the
realization of the dream of Digital Living. Both can happily exist independently of each
other, but together they provide an unbeatable combination of power, performance and
elegance.
</P>
<P><B>AmigaDE &amp; AmigaOS</B></P>
<P>
The AmigaDE is a universal content environment that can sit native on low-to-medium
resource devices or sit hosted, in software, on medium to high end devices. Its purpose
is to provide a consistent, interactive environment for users across many different
devices and to provide a consistent development model for developers across those same
devices.
</P>
<P>
The AmigaDE uses the Tao-Group's intent® product set to provide a clean service
abstraction that allows it to sit on both hardware and software hosts. In this context,
one should consider the full device itself as a set of layers with hardware at one end
and, a user experience at the other. Separating them is a set of layers which take the
capabilities of the hardware, abstracts and packages them and then makes them available
to system and third party applications, which in turn are experienced and manipulated by
the user via a content environment.
</P>
<P>
From the user's point of view, such static terms as 'desktop' and 'workstation' no longer
need to define the digital experience. The AmigaDE is a digital environment in which any
content can be executed subject to both its requirements and the capabilities of the host
on which it is sitting. If the AmigaDE is hosted on a physical device which has a Geforce
2 graphics card, a 1 gigahertz Athlon and 256 megabytes of SDRAM, then it will be able to
offer those services to any content that runs on it. If it is running on a PDA with a 100
megahertz processor, 8 megabytes of SDRAM and no hardware accelerated features, then it
will only run content that is able to execute within those resource constraints.
</P>
<P>
From the developer's point of view, such dynamic brokerage requires that they either
create content for a specific level, in the knowledge that it will run on anything above
that level, or they can take special advantage of the tailoring system, allowing the
AmigaDE to dynamically modify the performance and presentation of content to the device
profile. They can thus choose to target smaller markets as a subset or go for the broader
market for increased sales.
</P>
<P>
If one considers the device as a whole, then the AmigaDE starts at the user end and grows
down towards the hardware end. Since every device has its own particular physical
nuances, the AmigaDE uses its clean service abstraction wherever possible to take
advantage of other operating systems that have already done all the hard work of
abstracting the hardware. This allows the AmigaDE to spread rapidly to the maximum number
of devices with the minimum amount of effort whilst offering the device builder (and
through them the user) the choice of how they want to present and experience the AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
Some users can chose to run it co-operatively on top of an existing and well understood
Operating System, such as Windows or Linux, whilst others can use it on its own, choosing
a software host that best suits their needs to sit underneath it, perhaps a small
realtime operating system. In this master mode, the software host remains hidden beneath
it, and the user chooses only to interact with and work within the AmigaDE environment.
The emphasis in this approach is on the word 'choice', something that no other operating
system provides in such a complete way as the AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
Amiga is hard at work on the next version of the Software Development Kit (SDK) which
allows developers a glimpse of more capabilities of the AmigaDE and introduces the
multimedia services for the first time. This will ensure an abundance of content when the
AmigaDE makes its first appearances in the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
The AmigaOS, Amiga's other new product is intended to become the server core for Digital
Living. This will be built up from the existing base provided by AmigaOS 3.9, the latest
version of the venerable but neglected AmigaOS that started its life in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The current AmigaOS, version 3.9 runs on the old AA hardware which, while advanced for
its time, is now showing its age. After much discussion with the existing Amiga
community, Amiga released the zico specification. Zico is an open description of hardware
that Amiga encourages IHVs to use, and which provides a requirement for the first version
of AmigaOS4, OS4.0 to run on. This provides such features as a PPC processor, PCI, AGP,
USB, Firewire and other features standard in other computers but are new to the AmigaOS.
</P>
<P>
PPC was chosen both because it continues the relationship of Amiga with the Motorola
processor family, and because with the Book E specifications, the PPC family now offers a
very easy migration path from 32 bit to 64 bit processors.
</P>
<P>
All of these hardware facilities are required to provide a first step towards the
physical requirements that the new AmigaOS will have in its role of a next generation
digital server. A clean implementation, with no performance losses due to being tied to
the older AA systems, means full access to what the user pays for and a far better
performance all around.
</P>
<P>
Amiga is also aware that during the past five years, third party companies contributed to
the extension of the Amiga AA platform by providing PPC accelerator cards in ingenious
implementations to increase processor power past the discontinued 68k series. In
considering the design of OS4, much thought was given as to whether it should also run on
those cards. While Amiga had a great willingness to reward the owners of those cards for
the loyalty they have shown to the Amiga, it was also painfully aware that many of the
implementations were done in such a way that, while adding performance to the AA Amigas,
the details of the implementations would be antagonistic to the performance of a new
version of the OS, slowing it down and, in some cases, crippling it.
</P>
<P>
Given that AmigaOS4 is the first step on the road to a product in which performance will
be of paramount importance, it was decided that there would have to be a clean break.
This was done with the zico specification and, because of the clean nature of that
specification, the first zico compliant device, the Eyetech AmigaOne - the first, new
Amiga certified hardware in over five years - has been designed in record time and will
soon be available for shipping.
</P>
<P>
However, Amiga is still mindful of the thousands of loyal users and developers who have
invested significantly in the PPC accelerators. Amiga is looking to offer an opportunity
for third parties to create a software compatibility layer that can map the clean OS4 to
these PPC accelerators.
</P>
<P>
AmigaOS4 itself will move the existing 68K-based OS3.9 to a PPC implementation. By order
of impact upon user experience, each library and module is being examined and
re-implemented in such a way as to take maximum advantage of the new zico standard
motherboards and their sub system cards. This is a gradual process and will be spread out
over a few releases of the operating system. Consequently, the first release (OS4.0) will
contain a mixture of native PPC and 68K code which will run through a high speed PPC 68K
emulator. As further releases come out, the proportion of PPC code to 68K code will
increase until the OS no longer needs to run any emulated code within itself.
</P>
<P>
In addition AmigaOS4 will also open up the capabilities of the zico standard, providing
USB, Firewire and full access to the PCI and AGP world of plug in system cards. Amiga
users will be able to take full advantage of the very latest in graphics,audio and
networking technologies
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, AmigaOS4 will see the first introduction of the AmigaDE for existing
Amigans, with it running co-operatively on top of the Operating System, and then slowly
being integrated until, with the release of AmigaOS5, both will effectively merge to
become one.
</P>
<P>
AmigaOS4 will not only be able to run existing AmigaOS applications (this requires an
Eyetech AmigaOne with a AA system attached to it to provide the AA chipset), but also new
AmigaOS4 applications. In addition, the presence of the AmigaDE means that AmigaOS users
will also have access to the growing volume of AmigaDE applications, able to take full
advantage of its host (one of the advantages of Amiga owning its own host) and as a side
benefit, they also have access to the large volume of Java applications, since the
AmigaDE also provides a high efficiency Java solution.
</P>
<P>
In one go, Amigans, both users and developers will go from a small, isolated platform to
one that reaches across the AmigaOS, AmigaDE and Java worlds, providing an abundance of
content and a huge increase in market potential for developers. They can either develop
for the AmigaDE, in which case they have a large market opportunity that spreads far
beyond the number of AmigaOS users or they can concentrate on the AmigaOS and take
maximum advantage of the advanced features of both the new hardware and the new OS.
Again, the emphasis is on choice.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate purpose of the AmigaOS product is to reach AmigaOS5, where all the services
required by the digital core product set will be finally implemented. This includes brand
new and, in some cases, revolutionary new services that will put the AmigaOS firmly out
in front once again. These are being developed internally by Amiga in parallel with the
AmigaOS4 product set and will be available later in 2002. More details will be released
as the work progresses.
</P>
<P>
For those requiring a small taster, there follows a preliminary feature list and version
schedule. All things are subject to change. The first release of AmigaOS4 is targeted for
Summer (in the Northern Hemisphere), with further releases every six months.
</P>
<P><B>AmigaOS 4</B></P>
<P>
AmigaOS4 represents Amiga taking control of the AmigaOS and reinvigorating it as it
drives it forwards as an integral part of the Amiga Digital Environment.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the AmigaOS4 family of releases is to;
</P>
<UL>
<LI> move the 68K OS3.9 to a native PPC OS, enhancing and where necessary
  reimplementing the OS to take advantage of the PPC CPU
</LI>
<BR><LI> add new functionality to improve the functionality and performance of
  AmigaOS
</LI>
<BR><LI> allow for full backwards compatability via the Eyetech AmigaOne (with a
  classic Amiga attached) or retargetable application compatibility via any
  AmigaOne
</LI>
<BR><LI> move the community to new, state of the art hardware
</LI>
<BR><LI> provide an attractive computing environment to non Amigans so as to
  encourage growth of the Amiga community
</LI>
<BR><LI> integrate the AmigaDE into the AmigaOS
</LI>
<BR><LI> provide a foundation for the development of AmigaOS5
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
This project will be accomplished via a staged set of releases which allow Amiga Inc to
build from the bottom up. This gives developers the maximum increase in performance
across the releases and ensures that the users can look forwards to regular and better
products rather than having to wait over a long and frustrating period of time until
something is in their hands.
</P>
<P><B>AmigaOS 4.0</B></P>
<P>
AmigaOS4.0 is the first release of AmigaOS4. It provides the first stage on the road to a
PPC AmigaOS designed to take full advantage of the potential of the zico based computers
being developed.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to take the key elements of the current AmigaOS and reimplement them as
PPC native systems, providing for the biggest increase in performance. The remaining
elements will be left as 68k code for this release and be executed via a PPC 68k
emulator, which will also be used for the execution of 68k based application code. In
addition, it will add new features that have never before been available in the AmigaOS.
</P>
<P><B>The feature set for OS4.0 will include;</B></P>

  it will be done via the native PPC 68K emulator. At no time will a real 68k
  processor be used
</LI>
<BR><LI> Virtual Memory System - OS4.0 will for the first time allow developers to
  create new applications that can take proper advantage of the MMU
  capabilities of the PPC and make use of Virtual Memory, particularly
  important with the new games and applications being created. This will be
  PPC native
