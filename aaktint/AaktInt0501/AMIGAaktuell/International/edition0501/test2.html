<H2>2. Addition to the BoingBag 3.9.1 review (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
Well, what shall I say? One day after I mailed the BoingBag-review to Carsten, there was
a reworked BB1 available on the server at Amiga. If there hasn't been a message at
amiga-news.de, perhaps no-one had noticed it, because neither the versionnumber was
different from the first BB1, nor there were large differences in the archive size. This
shows once again the &quot;funny&quot; information policy of Amiga. On the other hand, one has to
praise the fast reaction to bug-reports and the fast release of BB1 (or not praise: read
the reports of readers who wrote me).
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, I made a mistake, too. The shown command line to copy utilities.catalog on
the os3.9-cdrom to fix the IconEdit-bug was wrong. It must be:
</P>
<PRE>
&quot;copy amigaos3.9:OS-Version3.9/Locale/Catalogs/deutsch/Sys/utilities.catalog
Locale:Catalogs/deutsch/sys/&quot;
</PRE>
<P>
Meanwhile, because of the reworked BB1 this bug should be gone.
</P>
<P><B>To the new BB1:</B></P>
<P>
The mentioned problems with the german utilities.catalog and IconEdit have been fixed and
also some updated Commodities have been accommodated in the new BB1.
</P>
<P>
No-one has reported anything about the mentioned problems about integrating AMPlifier
into Voyager and I had not enough time to wrestle with that problem. As soon as I find
any time for that and maybe find a solution (or an attentive reader sends me all
necessary information), I will keep you informed.
</P>
<P>
The second mentioned problem with HDToolBox has been discovered by me now: As my
SCSI-hostadapter (Blizzard-1230IV-SCSI-Kit) broke down last month and I had to remove it,
there was a wrong (better: non-existing) device-driver (1230scsi.device) entered in the
tooltype-settings of HDToolBox.
</P>
<P>
After deleting this tooltype, HDToolBox worked properly. I cannot say if it was a bug in
HDToolBox or a wrong configuration done by me. A little information from HDToolBox, that
the entered device-driver is not available, would have been nice. There is no reason for
making things more complex than they must be.
</P>
<P>
Some readers have reported their experiences with BoingBag1 for OS3.9 and I should pass
them on to you:

&gt;Unfortunately, Boingbag1 triggered bigger problems with FastFileSystem (V45.9!!):<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;- there were files named &quot;&quot; and size 0 Bytes, date 01.01.1978<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;- after a crash whilst surfing some directories were &quot;vanished&quot; or had checksum errors<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;- of course I did not have a complete backup...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Now I have installed the SmartFileSystem and I am happy. -&gt; my recommendation: delete<BR>
FFS, install SFS!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;ASyncWB is quite nice, but on my configuration it &quot;froze&quot; (mouse pointer completely<BR>
pinned, no graphics-output)<BR>
&gt;the computer a couple of times.<BR>
<P>
For the slow ASyncWB I have to say it needs a fast harddisc-controller. With a
zorroII-IDE-controller or the internal IDE-adapter for the A1200, the cpu will be busy
with ASyncWB a lot. I discovered that when I had to do without my SCSI-adapter and only
had a 2.5&quot;-IDE-harddisc on hand. On the other hand with a working SCSI-adapter ASyncWB's
speed is absolutely satisfactory. That the whole system freezes because of ASyncWB is not
correct anyway. Perhaps increasing buffers for the different partitions using the
AddBuffers-command or with HDToolBox may help. Numbers around 1000 should lead to a
noticeable performance increase.

&gt; I have had strong crashes at starting (I have EASys installed).<BR>
&gt; Testing the AmigaOSUpdate-file (seems to be an lha-archive), one can see which programs<BR>
are silently<BR>
&gt; installed. By replacing one of these files with the older ones, the error does not<BR>
occur anymore. On my<BR>
&gt; system it was the &quot;rxlib&quot; in &quot;sys:rexxc&quot;-drawer. Now everything runs successfully...<BR>
;-)<BR>
<P>
Thanks for that hint! Users having problems with ARexx and/or EASys after installing
BoingBag1 should try this hint. By the way, the amigaOSUpdate-file is a
password-protected ZIP-file. Why it is protected so that you cannot decompress these
files with ZIP or UnArc is obscure. Amiga Inc. does not place much trust in amiga-users.

<P><B>Gernod Schomberg (<A HREF="mailto:G.Schomberg@t-online.de">G.Schomberg@t-online.de</A>) wrote a whole experience-report:</B></P>
&gt; This is my experience/opinion:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; My attitude towards AmigaOS3.9 is not very friendly, so it doesn't surprise me that<BR>
another fix, or whatever you want &gt; to call it, has been released &gt; so fast. Of course I<BR>
downloaded the archive immediately and after &gt; decompressing it gazed with amazement on<BR>
4,5 MB of locale-files. I am not bothered about &gt; these files, as I am an alien to,<BR>
nearly everywhere, but there should have been a preselection for the languages &gt; one<BR>
wants to have beside english. We would have saved a lot in download-costs!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Just to rub it in, I noticed the message from 5.April:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; *BoingBag3.9-1<BR>
&gt; At the OS3.9-support-site there is an actual BoingBag3.9-1 archive available with<BR>
little changes since<BR>
&gt; 04.04.2001. The actual file size is 5.254.174 bytes. All of us who already downloaded<BR>
BoingBag3.9-1 before,<BR>
&gt; have to download it again.<BR>
&gt; The following changes have been made:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; 1. german localization of IconEdit now correct<BR>
&gt; 2. commodities Blanker, CrossDOS, Exchange and FKey are now included in their latest<BR>
versions*<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Because of these sundries I had to download the whole package again!<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Since OS3.9 I installed (as recommended) FBlit to save some chipmem for the GlowIcons<BR>
(it did not save<BR>
&gt; much). After that, I had problems cutting brushes in &quot;DPaint&quot; and &quot;PPaint&quot;. In FBlit I<BR>
deactivated these &gt; &gt; programs within preferences and that worked.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; With BoingBag there came &quot;ASyncWB&quot;. And now there is the same error as mentioned<BR>
before, when trying to &gt; cut a part of the screen with TurboPrint and copy it to RAM. In<BR>
the cut area black lines appear. Solution:<BR>
&gt; Use &quot;FBlit&quot; OR &quot;ASyncWB&quot;. I decided to do the first.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; The new WBRun does not work on my configuration. I cannot start any program with Icons<BR>
out of a script or from &gt; the shell. I installed the older WBRun V2.2 and everything<BR>
worked well again.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Gernod Schomberg<BR>
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:g.schomberg@t-online.de">g.schomberg@t-online.de</A><BR>
<P><B>Gernod even wrote an addendum. Please read on:</B></P>
&gt; Addendum:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I was worried that if I installed BoingBag1 step by step &gt; I might miss something<BR>
important being overwritten.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Therefore I copied my SYS:-Partition, that is always under 100 MBytes, to a bootable<BR>
ZIP-disc and installed &gt; BoingBag there. At startup of that disc I got this message twice<BR>
:&quot;WBRUN: OUT OF MEMORY&quot;, but the &gt; booting continued. In fact, WBRun is used at least 4<BR>
times in user-startup.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; And now I have to correct myself, I can start programs from scripts, and that works on<BR>
my real SYS:-partition &gt; too, but saving out of those programs, say configurations or<BR>
saved games, does not work. The saves start &gt; with &quot;WBRun&quot; opening a requester with a<BR>
message that just says that is not possible. I cannot say which &gt; programs are affected<BR>
in general as I don't want to endanger important programs and did not make any further &gt;<BR>
tests.<BR>
&gt;<BR>

<P>
Well it seems there are still some bugs left in the AmigaOS3.9-update despite reworking.
Those of you who want to comment on the problems mentioned and the reports may get in
touch with me or have your say on the amiga-aktuel-forum.
