<H2>4. Informations about AmigaDE-Script-Language &raquo;Sheep&laquo; (by Stefan Czinczoll)</H2>
<P><B>Talking SHEEP</B></P>
<P>
The famous author of th AmigaE language Wouter van Oortmerssen has created a new piece of
computational art, which may serve the Amiga Digital Environment as an innovative script
language.
</P>
<P>
Wouter now works for Amiga Inc. as his regular occupation. The project's name code is
SHEEP (which is, as he told me, NOT an acronym :-) SHEEP will be a new form of
programmer's state of expressions with multi-purpose capabilities. It is designed to be
far more powerful than it's predecessor ARexx. In the near future SHEEP will become the
glue to hold the basis for the AmiVerse.
</P>
<P>
Similar to ARexx SHEEP is at first glance quite a normal language for interpreters, which
also can be used for interprocess-communication. Furthermore, it can be used for
databank-queries (in SQL-stile) and flexible creation and change of GUIs (graphical user
interfaces).
</P>
<P><B>Where are the differences to ARexx now?</B></P>
<P>
At first SHEEP looks like a standard imperative code languaga as ANSI C, Modula-2,
(V-)Basic or E. In core it is driven by a functional approach, though. Amiga World number
four presents the following simple example:
</P>
<PRE>
type tree = branch(left:tree, right:tree) | leaf(data)
</PRE>
<P>
This creates a simple data structure &quot;tree&quot;, whose branches can also be of tree-type
(recursive), or be leaves. These leaves may contain constant or variable data or records
of data. This way it is possible (and quite easy) to generate your own data types freely,
build up super-types and comply with all questioned purposes perfectly.
</P>
<P>
So SHEEP is a perfect language to do rapid prototyping. Using the interpreter the
programs can be executed on the machine very fast. Human can use the compiler to
translate the sheepies into fast code for the (virtual) processor. As always in the field
of computation, speed matters: The sheepies run faster than ther pendants in Java, ARexx
or Basic. The average speed lies in magnitude of C/C++.
</P>
<P>
The turning towards an object oriented approach of programming is clearly evident within
SHEEP and matches the modular organization of the AmigaDE. Memory management is taking
place without the traditional garbage collection for dynamic objects, as found in many
other languages. Au contraire, there is a protection mechanism for preventing memory
contents with important data of being overwritten by mistake. So SHEEP also becomes a
good language for beginners on the field of programming.
</P>
<P>
Most impressing i found the example of Quicksort in SHEEP. Here it becomes a (rather
complex, though) code of just four lines. There is no consideration of the type of data
being sorted. This is not due to sloppyness, but fully intentional: So the same piece of
code can sort integers, pieces of text or any information, that comes along and is
countable ordinarily, (i.e. not &quot;complex&quot;).
</P>
<P>
Also new is the concept of vectors for data storage:
</P>
<P>
Data normally stored in static arrays or within dynamic lists is enclosed in these
vectors. They can be manipulated using simple operations. The following example may show
the idea with &quot;a&quot; being such a vector:
</P>
<PRE>
a = [1,2,3] a = a+[4,5,6]
</PRE>
<P>
results in [1,2,3,4,5,6] for a. In a very similar way the &quot;+&quot;-operator can be used to
split vectors into their parts. Modularization and integrated error and exception
routines make SHEEP &quot;round&quot; in a way, that is most presentable.
</P>
<P>
Without discussing the other examples in this place, one can say that SHEEP really is
friendly to beginners and places a very modern alternative compared to E. It incooperates
lots of single good features from languages like ARexx, Prolog, BASIC, Perl, Java and
Python. Advanced programmers will find possibillities of expressing their ideas within
SHEEP, that are capable of the realization of projects at least of mid-size magnitude in
a very reasonable manner.
</P>
<P>
Because of it's simplicity an enormous potential i have asked Wouter about potential
risks placed by Virii, Trojans, etc. that could come from using SHEEP. Similar to
Javascript code, which should normally not be able to erase code on the harddisk, there
will be a protection mechanism between the information contained within emails or
web-pages and lower planes.
</P>
<P>
The rest of issues in this area is left to programmers of mailing clients and personal
responsibility (or stupidity :-) of users.
</P>
<P>
By now SHEEP is in private beta stage. So there is no third-party report, which could be
integrated into this presentation. The success of AmigaE within the community gives raise
to the hope, that more users and developers will get to like the Amiga system.
