<H2>1. Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA) Berlin (by Thomas Nosutta / ACBB)</H2>
<P><B><BR>[International Radio and TV Exhibition at Berlin, Germany]</B></P>
<P>
In his keynote for the St. Louis Show, Bill McEwen mentioned that AMIGA
Inc. at this year's &quot;Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA)&quot; will be
represented by Sharp. And there the AmigaDE would be shown on an SL5000
(codename &quot;Zaurus&quot;). Because the Amiga Club Berlin &amp; Brandenburg
is on the spot, we agreed upon a common visit to the IFA.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, 2001 at 11 o'clock three members of the ACBB (A4k, Trion
and Gojira) met to storm the Sharp booth at the IFA. Over a cup of coffee
(as usual for the fabulously opportunistic show price of only DM 5.-) it was
decided, that we would not leave without having been permitted to see
the SL5000 (Zaurus).
</P>
<P>
At Sharp (Hall 3.2a) we were surprised to see not only one, but altogether
six of them! Unfortunately on most of them ran only the standard software
(calendar, addresses, memos etc.), made by Sharp. On one there was a
route-planner (Made in Germany), and there was another one showing MP3.
Because it was not overcrowded, we were able to pose several questions
about the device. Asking, where the AmigaDE software could be seen, the
answer was &quot;Amiga???&quot;! (Somehow I felt, that those temporary student
helpers should have gotten a better training ... :-) ). He did not know
anything about, that there is Amiga software supposed to run on the
SL5000! And to the questions, if there was anybody around knowing
it, and where AMIGA Inc. could be found, only a helpless shaking of his
head was the answer. Frustrated we retreated to discuss the situation.
What to do, for we firmly were determined, not to leave ... Far and
wide not a single hint to AMIGA Inc., which disappointed us quite heavily.
:-(
</P>
<P>
So up and away to the Information for Distributors and Press! Just for a
try! A quick question about a competent contact person for the SL5000, and
lo, there was Mrs. Boxberg (Product Manager Sharp Germany) and pleased
to meet us! Already the first sentences showed to us that this lady knew
what she was talking about, and &quot;Amiga&quot; did not seem to be a foreign word
to her :-) : Of course there was an SL5000 with AmigaDE on hand and we could
see and hold it.
</P>
<P>
She told us, too, that Sharp is interested in contacting German (European)
Amiga programmers! In this case just amiga-news.de (because it is translated
to many languages) comes to the mind of the Amiga freak as first address!
Then she led us to the mystery of the day: A prototype of the SL5000, with
several AmigaDE games running on it (Linea and Batty by Titan Computer,
Boxikon by Epic, Convex by NeoNeo and Sol [exact descriptions and screenshots
of the games in the AmigaDE range at <A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com</A>]). A short view of
the Elate shell, and we are convinced that all AMIGA Inc. had promised,
was pure truth. The Zaurus is alive and on hand! (Unfortunately due to the
narrowness, the three people and the fact, that the SL5000 only ran with
mains power supply connected, a more detailed test was not possible.)
</P>
<P>
Our question, why AMIGA Inc. was not present, Mrs. Boxberg answered with
difficulties in scheduling, but emphasized, that she quite often had phoned
AMIGA Inc. I came to the belief, that Sharp did not fully know, where and how
to range AMIGA (press policy AMIGA Inc.???).
</P>
<P>
The SL5000 feels good in the hand, and the keyboard can be used comfortably.
Because we only had come because of the AmigaDE, we did not care for
additional features of the SL5000.
</P>
<P>
During the talk suddenly someone stood behind me - and what did I see:
A BoingBall on the shirt! :-)) It was Sanjay Menon (Vice President
Engineering) of AMIGA Inc. (VK at the web-gallery ACBB)! He was excited
that Amiga users troubled and he was surprised that we were so
interested. Our questions he answered as competently and objectively as
Mrs. Boxberg. Furthermore he showed us his personal SL5000, running an
additional game, a slotmachine.
</P>
<P>
Considering all this, we really were contented and very politely said
Good Bye. But one thing we had to get rid of: &quot;Too bad, that Sharp did
not make any billings for AMIGA, say nothing of an own AMIGA booth.&quot; Mrs.
Boxberg answered: They are setting about this, but they cannot promise
anything for the IFA.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the variety of programs only had shown part of the
possibilities. But if they transfer all we had seen to the
desktop, we will have a rosy future ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
We, the ACBB, are content and proud to have seen as the first German
Amiga club the SL5000 with AmigaDE.
</P>
<P>
So let's be curious for the CeBIT 2002, then and there hopefully with the
Sharp SL5000 (powered by AmigaDE)!
