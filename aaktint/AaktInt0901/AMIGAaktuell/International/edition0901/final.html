<P><B>Murphy's Law (by Christian Aichinger)</B></P>
<P>
Or: If something can go wrong, then it will
</P>
<P>
Apart from the fact that every computer owner has experienced this
Hibernian shibboleth more than once, it sums up very well the recent
happenings around the AMIGA WORLD [1] planned for this year. The maxpo
2001 [2] has been cancelled due to unwillingness by companies active in the
Apple sector, and not the least Apple Germany itself.
</P>
<P>
But how is maxpo concerned with Amiga? Quite simple: Falke-Media
Editors, known to Amiga users through their periodical AMIGA Plus, and
furthermore offering cover of two other niche systems (&quot;mac life&quot;
for Apple Macintosh and &quot;ST-Computer&quot; for Atari users), wanted to stage
at the said show AMIGA WORLD 2001, certainly not quite unselfish.
With high probability the bulk of the hard- and software manufacturers
and distributors established in the Amiga market would have been quite
content with this solution, because most of them meanwhile, due to the
bad situation of the Amiga market, have cast a glance at the &quot;fruit bowl&quot;,
to keep the balance. For those distributors displaying on their Internet
storefronts a BoingBall and a bitten apple side by side would have been
a good chance to strut their stuff to Mac users, and the PowerMac
emulation &quot;iFUSION&quot; certainly would have been fascinating for some
or many Mac users.
</P>
<P>
But where does &quot;Amiga&quot; fit into this picture, basically this is
the center of interest at an AMIGA WORLD? If you take a harder look at the
past three quarters of this year you see that there is not much
that AMIGA really could boast of or that would in any way justify an
Amiga show. Most of it, the releases of several PCI
extensions or iFUSION: the end of the odyssey, are much too late to
thrill an earnest Mac user, nor could they bring back the &quot;Classic Amiga&quot;
to the limelight. iFUSION only can simulate a PowerMac with a clipped
down G3 CPU, which does not impress a Mac user very much - on the
contrary, After hearing the purchase price for such a vehicle (Amiga
- PPC + iFUSION + ...) he would quickly turn away. On the Apple platform
PCI for years has been a quasi-standard, while even mundane things like USB
cannot be had on the Amiga platform. Even the improvement, or
better the announcements, which Mr. McEwen and Mr. Moss have made this year
have no concern with Macintosh computers in any way and are completely
out of place at an Apple/Amiga show. Or is there an AmigaDE running
under MacOS X? I for myself haven't heard anything about it.
<P>
In my opinion the primary purpose of a show should be to present the
latest technological progress of a special product as cool as possible.
But Amiga shows of latter years more or less remind of a second-hand
market and a sales fair, where technologies were displayed or sold which
only served the purpose of ironing out the worst deficiencies of
the unfortunately still recent &quot;Classic-Amiga&quot; generation. For the leading
group in Snoqualmie such shows additionally were a good occasion to upset
all previously announced roadmaps, to make Amiga enterprises and users feel
confused. It is clear that the Amiga community cannot keep up to date with the
technological standards of other platforms, or even partly, with such an
approach. The &quot;AMIGA WORLD&quot; urgently needs something new. But if those
&quot;novelties&quot; do not mean anything more than crash-happy prototypes (or
empty cardboard housings with TFT monitors plugged in) and beta or even
only alpha versions, than an Amiga presentation at an Apple fair only can
be called a joke.
</P>
<P>
To refer to Murphy's Law: Is it really so bad, if sometimes something goes
wrong? I don't think so. An AMIGA WORLD delayed for several weeks could
save the Amiga some trouble and the last devoted supporters quite a lot
of mockery.
</P>
<P>
With this until the next edition.<BR>
