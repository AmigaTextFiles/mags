<P><B>Preliminary remarks</B></P>
<P>
The AMIGA aktuell FAQ (FAQ = frequently asked questions) is intended to
preserve the sanity and save the time of the editorial staff of AMIGA
aktuell International, and of course to answer your questions as
quickly and as simply as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hence before you send a question to Carsten Schroeder or to me, please
read this document first. It contains some questions which have never
been asked before. But in my opinion many of those &quot;invented&quot;
questions deserve to be asked and answered, too.
</P>
<P>
If you believe that important questions and answers are missing in the FAQ
or if you have ideas on how to improve it, please send a message to
Christian Aichinger &lt;<A HREF="mailto:christian@aakt.de">christian@aakt.de</A>&gt;. The FAQ will immediately be
extended.
</P>
<H3>1. General questions</H3>
<P><B>Q: What is AMIGA aktuell International?</B></P>
<P>
A: AMIGA aktuell International is the English translation of the
   German Amiga infotainment magazine AMIGA aktuell, which is mainly
   concerned with the &quot;Amiga&quot; computer platform
   (<A HREF="http://www.amiga.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.amiga.com</A>). In AMIGA aktuell news, workshops, test
   reports and much more are published. On occasion additional AMIGA
   aktuell Specials are released. AMIGA aktuell International appears
   as an HTML version in the English language. Both editions are
   available free of charge to interested readers. AMIGA aktuell is
   published monthly and normally is released in the first week of
   each month. AMIGA aktuell International appears approx. three weeks
   later.
</P>
<P><B>Q: How can I obtain AMIGA aktuell International?</B></P>
<P>
A: There are several ways to get AMIGA aktuell International. The
   two most important are:
</P>
<P>
   *. From the homepage (<A HREF="http://www.aakt.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.aakt.de</A>). Here you will find the
   online edition of AMIGA aktuell International. The latest
   edition can be downloaded as an LhA archive, and there is an
   archive of the older editions, too.
</P>
<P>
   *. From the Aminet: In the directory docs/mags there are most of
   the editions of AMIGA aktuell International. The latest
   editions are uploaded as soon as possible to the Aminet server.
</P>
<P>
   In the AMIGA aktuell International section &quot;Internal/Distribution&quot;
   additional methods of distribution and information about
   subscription can be found.
</P>
<H3>2. Questions about writing articles</H3>
<P>
<B>Q: I'd like to write an article. Must I master HTML or AmigaGuide?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: No! If you write an article, the text should be in ASCII format.
   The conversion of the text to HTML and Amigaguide is done by
   diligent members of the AMIGA aktuell staff. If you want to ease
   the life of those people a bit, you can take care to let the lines
   be no longer than 75 characters.
</P>
<P>
   Even better: Let each paragraph be in just one line (unlimited
   number of characters per line and paragraph). After you finish your
   article, please check the spelling again. The best way is to leave
   your work for a day, then read the text again, or ask a
   friend/relative to proof-read it. In most cases you will find some
   additional mistakes/typos. Of course, further proof-reading is done
   by the editor's staff.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: May I write/translate my texts for the international edition in any
   language?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: No! Unfortunately the AMIGA aktuell team only has translators with
   skill in the English and German languages. We regret that articles
   by authors in other languages cannot be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: I'd like to illustrate my article with several graphics. Which
   format should I save the graphics to?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: Pictures in highcolor and truecolor format (15/16/24 bit) must be
   available in JEPG format. The quality should be decreased to 75 -
   80 percent. Other graphics (&lt;=8 bit) must be saved to PNG format.
   The resolutions shouldn't be higher than 800x600 pixels. If several
   screenshots are used, they should be numbered in the relevant
   sequence, (eg. ArtEffekt1.jpg, ArtEffekt2.png, etc.).
</P>
<P><B>Q: Are there some things I must include?</B></P>
<P>
A: Yes! If your article is about a program which is shareware or a
   commercial software, you should state the price in Euro and/or DM
   and/or US dollars. Besides that, a European and/or international
   distributor should be named, if known.
</P>
<H3>3. Questions about Subscription</H3>
<P>
<B>Q: Is it possible to subscribe for the AMIGA aktuell Specials, without
   receiving the magazine itself?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: No! The subscribers list for the magazine and for the Specials is
   not managed separately. Please consider the Specials as a kind of a
   bonus.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: My e-mail program has problems decoding the AMIGA aktuell
   (International) archive. What is the reason?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: You use an older e-mail program, which does not support &quot;base64&quot;
   coded data. Get yourself a more up-to-date version or use another
   e-mail program. If you do not want to do that, you can find several
   tools in the Aminet, which make it possible to read data coded in
   &quot;base64&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: But why don't you use an Amiga format for encoding the Amiga
   aktuell (International) archive?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: There is no Amiga format for data coded in this way (not any more
   than there is a PC or Macintosh format). It depends upon the
   version of the e-mail program you currently use. Every newer
   (Amiga) e-mail program is able to decode e-mail messages in
   &quot;base64&quot; format.
</P>
<P>
   If such problems occur, talk to the author of the program.
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: On my PC I do not have an LhA unpacker. Are the
   AMIGA-aktuell-(International) archives available in ZIP
   compression?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: Not until now, because LhA is the standard Amiga compression
   format. But there are several LhA unpackers for Windows, among
   other platforms on the Aminet.
</P>
<H3>4. Miscellaneous Questions</H3>
<P>
<B>Q: I just loaded AMIGA aktuell International, but I cannot view any
   graphics. What am I doing wrong?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: The graphics, which are in an extra archive, have to be installed.
   For example, the Amiga aktuell International edition 1200 (December
   2000) needs the graphics copied to the directory
   &quot;international/edition1200/img/&quot;. If you use an older webbrowser
   for viewing, it is possible that the datatypes system of the Amiga
   is used for the display. No datatypes, no display. In this case
   download a datatype for JPG graphics and another one for PNG
   graphics from the Aminet (e.g. util/dtype/WarpJPEGdt and
   util/dtype/WarpPNGdt).
</P>
<P>
<B>Q: What, the FAQ ends here? I still have an important question, which
   hasn't been answered yet. Whom may I ask?</B>
</P>
<P>
A: Please send a mail to me &lt;<A HREF="mailto:christian@aakt.de">christian@aakt.de</A>&gt; or Carsten Schroeder
   &lt;<A HREF="mailto:aakt@aakt.de">aakt@aakt.de</A>&gt;.
