<H2>3. Softwaretest: ArtEffect Plugins-Collection (by Christian Aichinger)</H2>
<P>
Recently, Haage &amp; Partner [1] offered new supplies for the
graphics artists among Amiga users. The &quot;ArtEffect Plugins
Collection&quot; extends ArtEffect with additional filters, a
Postscript print function, border effects and a new load/save
module for additional graphics formats - the SuperView plugin.
Users who have never used ArtEffect before can use the full
version ArtEffect 2.5, which is included on this CD as well. Now
let's look if it is worthwhile to spend about 45.- Euro on this
disk.
</P>
<H3>System requirements</H3>
<P>
The Plugins Collection requires ArtEffect Version 2 or better. It
doesn't work with version 1.5 or 1.5SE. To avoid an unhealthy
consumption of coffee (some of the filters do some heavy
computing) it is recommended to have a fast 68k CPU (040/060), a
graphics board, large amounts of RAM and a fast harddisk. PowerPC
boards are not supported. The icons on the CD-ROM are saved in
the OS3.5/3.9 icon format, which gives a less appealing look on
OS versions older than 3.5. But the program itself requires only
AmigaOS 3.0 or better.
</P>
<H3>Contents</H3>
<P>
The Plugins Collection does not include a printed manual. An
english/german manual is on the CD. The disc, which isn't a real
CD-ROM, but a CD-R with a colorful label, comes with a one-sided
inlay in a normal jewel case. Surprisingly, the inlay is also
kind of Do-It-Yourself - made with a bubble jet printer. And
since the Collection comes neither with a registration form
nor a serial number and is obviously not copy protected in any
way, I cannot help but wonder why Haage &amp; Partner is making it so
easy for pirates to copy this software. The customer is also
always a little unsure whether he bought a licensed copy or only
a pirated one.
</P>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>
If you don't have an installation of ArtEffect, you should start
by installing the included version 2.5. After a reboot you can
start to install the plugins.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the plugins is done with an installer script
as well, but is not as problem-free as the ArtEffect
installation. While the installer does not report any errors and
the installation process runs to the end, you don't find any new
plugins in the menu of ArtEffect after rebooting. At least not if
you did not install ArtEffect from scratch before. That's because
the older plugins preferences in the directory &quot;Settings&quot; don't
work with the new plugins. A cure for this is to delete or rename
the whole directory (&quot;ArtEffect:Settings&quot;). After another reboot,
ArtEffect properly recognizes the new plugins. Unfortunately you
also have to reconfigure ArtEffect after that. That's something
Haage&amp;Partner should improve.
</P>
<P>
If you want the store the new border documents on your harddisk,
you should have 500 MB of disk space available. But you can also
keep them on the CD-ROM or on another partition. The script asks
you what you prefer before performing the installation.
</P>
<P>
The SuperView plugin from Andreas R. Kleinert is installed with a
separate script, which worked absolutely smooth. Caution: The
script warns you not to use the MCP commodity together with the
SuperView plugin (some functions of MCP have to be deactivated).
Take this warning seriously! Using the SuperView plugin while
having these patches installed led straight to a crash on my
system.
</P>
<H3>Documentation</H3>
<P>
The description and documentation of the new plugins are supplied
on the CD as a multilingual HTML document. The english and german
texts are always shown one below the other in the same HTML-
frame, which doesn't really help to read the texts. Well done, on
the other hand, are the &quot;Before/After&quot; graphics. A click on an
image loads the image after the filter has been applied. So you
can easily see what results you can expect from using a certain
filter. The english documentation by Haage &amp; Partner is also
available on the Internet. So if you want to take a look, go to
[2].
</P>
<P>
The documentation for the Postscript plugin is a separate
(english) AmigaGuide file on the CD. The manual for ArtEffect and
the SuperView plugin is also included on the CD as (german and
english) AmigaGuide texts. Unfortunately, they are both somewhat
hidden on the CD, so you have to go looking for them. I don't
understand why these are not installed with the programs.
</P>
<P>
For your convenience: The german manual for ArtEffect 2.5 can be
found at [3], the english one at [4]. The english documentation
for the SuperView plugin is at [5].
</P>
<H3>Postscript</H3>
<P>
The new Postscript plugin has a lot of options.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/aeplugin1.png"><IMG SRC="thumb/aeplugin1.jpg" WIDTH="98" HEIGHT="96" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
You can scale images to ratios like DIN A3, DIN A4 and DIN A5,
save them as a colored EPS file and of course also output them on
a Postscript printer. Besides setting margins and dithering
algorithms you can also set a lot of Postscript-specific options,
like resolution, contrast or orientation. Since I don't have a
Postscript printer, I used the Ghostscript 5.10 [6] package,
which had no problems handling the files created with ArtEffect.
I would like to mention that the plugin is very fast,
even on a 040. A truecolor image with 640x480 pixels took less
than 4 seconds to be saved as a compressed monochrome Postscript
file.
</P>
<P>
A high resolution truecolor image with 878x1314 pixels took 15-20
seconds, which isn't a too bad result for a 68040 CPU.
</P>
<H3>New file formats</H3>
<P>
The new SuperView plugin gives the ArtEffect user the possibility
to load and save a wide range of new file formats. This includes
the GIF and YUVN formats, which were heavily missed by some users
(you can load and save these two formats) as well as some more
exotic formats like MacPaint and ACBM (these two can only be
loaded). With additional third-party software like MetaView[7],
Ghostscript and fig2dev[8], you can even load vector formats like
WMF, AMF, EPS, PS or FIG or convert them into a pixel oriented
format.
</P>
<P><B>Here's a short list of the supported formats:</B></P>
<P><B>Loading and saving:</B></P>
<P>
BMP, GIF (87a, 89a) FBM, IFF (ILBM uncompressed, ILBM CmpByteRun1, DEEP,
RGB8, RGFX, YUVN), JPEG, PCX, PNG, PNM (PPM), QRT, SGI, SunRaster, SVG,
TGA, Amiga-Piktogramme (NewIcon and MagicWB/OS3.1), UtahRLE (only with
third-party software), Limbo (only with the third-party software), EPS
(Loading only with Ghostscript)
</P>
<P><B>Loading only:</B></P>
<P>
Datatypes, IFF (ACBM, FAXX, PBM), PhotoCD, Pictor/PC Paint, PNM (PBM, PGM),
Mac (MacPaint, PICT2), C64 (Koala, Doodle), WPG, TIM, CorelDraw- Header,
IMG, Windows-Piktogramme
</P>
<P><B>Loading only with third-party software:</B></P>
<P>AMF, DXF, FIG, CGM, DR2D, Postscript, WPG, WMF</P>
<P>
<B>only saving:</B>
</P>
<P>ASM- and C-Source</P>
<P>
You should keep in mind that some formats do not support 24bit
color depth, so images may be reduced in quality or color depth.
If you plan to edit the file later, be sure to pick the right
file format.
</P>
<H3>Borders</H3>
<P>
Interesting for all layouters and hobby photographers: The
&quot;Bordereffects&quot; plugin. This function, a little hidden in the
filter menu, let's you create a stylish frame around any image.
</P>
<P><B><A HREF="img/aeplugin2.jpg"><IMG SRC="thumb/aeplugin2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="93" ALT="Screenshot"  BORDER="0"></A></B></P>
<P>
The width of the frame can be chosen freely. Since there is no
way to create your own border documents (at least not that I know
of), The Plugin Collection comes with 264 high quality borders.
What I missed was a preview function that gives a quick
impression on how the border looks like. As it is, you have to
select each (2 MB large) border document and have it rendered by
the filter preview function. But at least all borders have a
telling icon that gives an idea on the result if you take the
detour over the Workbench.
</P>
<H3>Filters</H3>
<P>
Besides the new functions, the Plugins Collection of course also
contains a large number of new filters. These are simple but
useful functions like &quot;Eraser&quot; (clears the image to a selectable
color) or &quot;Prisma&quot; (the name says it all) as well as real
professional filters like &quot;Smart-Blur&quot; or &quot;UnSharpMask&quot;. Since a
detailed description of all filters would be too much for this
article, I will only list the new filters with a short comment:

<H3>Result</H3>
<P>
Well, what can I say? I like the Plugins Collection and would
recommend it to every ArtEffect user. It provides ArtEffect with
a lot of new filters and functions. The only drawbacks are the not
completely problem-free installation and the somewhat hidden
documentation. For a price of 45,- Euro you don't even get a
single filter like &quot;UnSharpMask&quot; or &quot;SmearBlur&quot; on other platforms
(prices there start with 75 to 100,- Euro). Even users who never
used ArtEffect before are recommended to buy this CD-ROM, because
the included full version ArtEffect 2.5 has only some small
limitations compared to the current version V4 (no text/effect
layers, no color gradients). Owners of a PPC board will have to
live without the (sometimes direly needed) support for their fast
CPUs.
