<H2>1. Test Report: Amiga Emulator Package &raquo;AmigaForever&laquo; - Part 3 (by K.-H. Bader)</H2>
<P>
As written in the previous part I would have preferred to have the
icon of the CD-ROM drive displayed with correct names of the CDs. And
indeed, this can be managed quite simply. Before that I had declared
my harddisk in the WinUAE settings as folder WinHD_x. And exactly
like this I had done it with the CD-ROM drives: WinCD_x. And this I
should have avoided. &quot;Workbench&quot; and &quot;Arbeit&quot; (Work) are the only two
directories, which I have to specify. And with a checkmark 'PC-Laufwerke
mit anzeigen' (Display PC drives) I can see all drives.

<P>
There is the snag that the PC drives are displayed with their
names and I have System and Work on the PC, too. Therefore for clarity's
sake I call my directories on the Amiga Workbench and Arbeit.
</P>
<P>
Now I can start my MicroDot without any tricks, so I believe to have a
fully working Amiga on my PC platform.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, August 12 ... For one reason or another my PC wasn't willing
to cooperate with my EmuAmiga WinUAE 016R4 any more. A big problem and
I tested quite a while to find the fault. Suddenly the PC drives are not
shown any more, and with checkmarks set, the Amiga does not start any more.
</P>
<P>
Oops, bug discovered. I had disabled the disk drive controller in the
device manager. Enabled again - everything runs okay. Little click -
big effect ;((
</P>
<P>Different WinUAE versions were recognized. ;(</P>
<P>
Well, that was it. Anyone, who can give me hints, just let them come
to me! And I am ready to answer your questions, as far as possible.
