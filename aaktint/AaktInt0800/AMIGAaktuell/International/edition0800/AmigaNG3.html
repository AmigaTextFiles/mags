<H2>3. AMIGA president Bill McEwen answers questions of the Community</H2>
<P>
After parts of the Amiga community were puzzled regarding implementing memory protection into the operating system of the
AmigaNG, the consideration of the desktop market as well as the software licensing, AMIGA president Bill McEwen commented
those items. This is his statement:
</P>
<P>
&raquo;In Response to Community Concerns Posted on MooBunny
</P>
<P>
We are very excited at the response that we have received in the first few
weeks of the Amiga SDK version 1 going out into the world. We have
received lots of feedback, mostly good, some not so good, and three
particular points have come up that we would like to address before they
become common untruths.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it is true that the Amiga Foundation Layer which ships on the SDK
does not have memory protection. However, this does not mean that AmiTM,
the next generation Amiga Digital Environment will not have memory
protection. A comment made in an article in the last AmigaWorld seems to
have been interpreted in such a way as to suggest that this is the case
when in fact the point being made was that Amiga is looking at many
solutions for providing robustness and security. AmiTM will provide a
robust, secure environment and we will use the most elegant and effective
means to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the End User Licence Agreement that made it into the SDK is in
error as a result of a legal misinterpretation. There is NO ROYALTY to be
paid for any application either created with the SDK or which will run on
AmiTM. Amiga will be creating a scheme in which third parties can pay a
royalty to Amiga in exchange for official Amiga certification, branding
and promotion. This provides a revenue stream to Amiga and a value add for
the third party. This scheme is entirely voluntary.
</P>
<P>
The third point has been drawn as a conclusion from the first two, namely
that Amiga is abandoning the desktop market. Nothing could be further from
the truth. The announced AmigaOne will feature processor options ranging
>from 600 Mhz to 1 Ghz, with other, even more powerful devices already on
the drawing board. The conclusion to be drawn from this is either that
Amiga is very committed to the desktop market or that we are going to
build one mother of a cellphone.
</P>
<P>
We are committed to making the Amiga THE best computer system in the world.
Yes we are also going to go into other markets, but that does not mean we
are abandoning the desktop, the Amiga philosophy or the loyal Amigans who
have stood by the platform through the good and the bad.
</P>
