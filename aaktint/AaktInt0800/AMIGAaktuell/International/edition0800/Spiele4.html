<P>
Skip this if you've already heard: The games &quot;Whale's Voyage 1 &amp; 2, Black Viper, Spherical Worlds and Fightin' Spirit&quot;, were published by Alive Mediasoft but without a licence from Neo Software, the original manufacturer. 
That's what Neo told &quot;Back to the Roots&quot;, when they sought permission for free distribution of those games.
The good news is that Neo gave Back2theRoots permission and the games can be downloaded from
