<H2>1. Report about the Amiga user meeting in Wolfenbuettel, Germany (by Oliver Tacke)</H2>
<P><B>July 08, 2000</B></P>
<P>
Around 9 a.m. the first participant entered and directly helped to hang &quot;AMIGA - Back for the future&quot; to show
the way to the room. Shortly after that Christian Steigies joined, who held the Debian 68k Linux workshop.
</P>
<P>
More and more people and computers filled the room. Fortunately the power lines were strong enough. Sometimes there were
more than 10 computers and their peripher devices on two sockets - and no one was able to test this in advance.
</P>

Around noon, there was a barbecue. Actually, this was planned for the evening. But coffee and sandwiches were unable to
withstand the hunger. After a few problems in the beginning, it worked fine.
</P>
<P>
As mentioned in the beginning, Christian Steigies made an introduction into Debian 68k Linux. Thomas Wenzel presented
the latest plugins for his mp3 player AmigaAMP. Marius Schwarz presented his extensive Workbench extension DirectDOS and
a remote control, which makes it possible to control various program (e.g. AmigaAMP) from the sofa using the serial port.
Rudolph Riedel showed his file manager Diskmaster for the Amiga, which he put into case, adjusted to his needs. In addition
you could watch Norman Thiel, soldering on a power supply of an Amiga 4000. From my Amiga 4000 :-) But it works fine.
Thanks, Norman!

Around 1:30 a.m. most guest were on their way home resp. on the way to their night quarters. Until 4:30 a.m. the remaining
two had fun with the game &quot;You don't know Jack&quot;, which ran by Mac emulation, until they also went to bed resp.
into their sleeping bags.
</P>
<P><B>July 09, 2000</B></P>
<P>
Boum! Boum! Boum! In the morning around 09:00 a.m. the first guest are knocking at the door and wake up the people sleeping
there for just a short time. So get up, have some coffe and rolls... Quickly, the room was filled with people and the
information exchange resumed. We were surprised, that the room was as full as on Saturday, because some people came without
prior reservation. But that was no problem - in the contrary!
</P>
<P>
Around noon, there were two very special guests: Juergen Haage and Markues Poellmann. Mr. Haage was quickly surrounded by
curious Amiga users and patiently answered their questions. Mr. Poellmann demonstrated OS3.5 and held a crash-course on
Intuition programming.

As a special surprise, Mr. Haage brought the full version of Tornado 3D (value: nearly 900 DEM (approx. 459.18 Euros))
for a competition. The lucky winner was Jens Marksteiner.
</P>
<P>
One by one left the meeting and at the evening it was over. But it was fun. It is very likely, that there will another
Amiga User Treffen in Wolfenbuettel. Maybe, there are more than 45 people...
