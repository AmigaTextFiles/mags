<P>
One participant didn't vote clearly.
</P>
<P>
Some participants commented the question of opnion:
</P>
<P>
Ralph Bernecker answered with: &raquo;Yes, but until then much powerful AMD-processors are going to cost less than 100 DEM...
sad, but true!
I want a new Amiga, because my A4000 is too old and is not stable enough on hardware level, to invest money in it.
</P>
<P>
In addition I need a G3, a new graphics board and at least a fast SCSI-controller or the speed advantage would only be used
partially.
</P>
<P>
I will pay up to 2000 DEM (approx. 1020.41 Euros) for a new Amiga. But it should fulfill my minimum requirements for
software like fast OS &amp; play MP3s in top quality &amp; GNU-C++ &amp; a fine graphics software (e.g. fxPaint).&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Kortemeiers hopes go down:&raquo;I really hope, that there will be G3/G4-boards for the Amiga, soon. But I
don't believe in it for real. The Wait-and-see-tactics are well-known in the Amiga sector.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Markus Tillmann means: &raquo;I think, that we will get a G3-board. Why should Met@box not have said, that they stopped
the project? Even if you cannot be sure about it, I believe in a G3-board for Amigas, but a later release date could lead
to small sales, if the new Amiga was released late this year/early next year!&laquo;&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Martin Cornelius's favorite is Escena: &raquo;Because there were only the answers &raquo;Yes&laquo; and &raquo;No&laquo;
I hope, that at least Escena manages to ship G3/G4-boards. In the contrary to Met@box Escena didn't make big promisses.
So Escena appears to be more trustworthy. So start up all your Amiga-optimism ;-), maybe there will be G3/G4 boards.
I personally think, that Escena has better chances than Met@box to release the G3/G4 boards. I am lucky to own a PPC-board,
but my A4000 would be happy about a G3/G4 board, anyway. ;-)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Hummel is skeptical: &raquo;I would still welcome the release of a G3/G4 board, especially if you consider the
new OS a 68k-emulation on such processors might work fine with the current OS as the PPC-software would! But it seems,
that all efforts fail...in my opinion the Brainstormer from Escena seems to be the right way, while the announcement of
Metabox to build for the A1200 only is a hit into the face of those, who bought an A4000 as &quot;professional&quot;
machine. But we will see... there were the weirdest things in the past. Who knows, maybe there will be a G3-board for
the Amiga one day!&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Rainer Traub might not have read the questions about Metabox not closely enough: &quot;As far as I know, the boards from
Metabox are in their final stage and are under intense tests. There is only the questions, what software exists to use
the G3/G4 processors for real...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Schmid sees the problems of the &raquo;AmiJoe&laquo;-project: &raquo;The redesign of a chip can take a long
time. If we are (not) lucky, the Amiga ONE comes first.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Andre Beer has a similar opinion: &raquo;On the expected release date late 2000 resp. 2001 the Amiga One should (I hope)
also be available. Then such a big (financial) investion into the &quot;Classic&quot;-Amiga is useless, in my opinion.
I would prefer the new NG-Amiga. (But I already own a PPC603-board.)&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Michael Seibt gives this statement: &raquo;I hope, that Metabox will be able to release the announced G3-boards BEFORE
2001, else this might become a gigaaaaantic fail. Who buys a G3-board for his old Amy, if there is the Amiga One available???&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Also Frank Schulz favorites the AmigaNG: &raquo;If the Amiga ONE was released on time and was an expandable creation
(tower/desktop), the development would be useless. But let's wait for another half year and we'll see.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Frank Bergmann has a short answer: &raquo;Yes, the one from Met@box...&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Thomas Muenzberg asks the developers to use the same PowerPC standard: &raquo;I'm an unforgiving optimist! Unfortunately
the G3-project for the A2000 is dead. My well-expanded 060-machine could have used some extra power.
</P>
<P>
A request to the busy programmers: Please use the same PPC operating system. My son has problems, if he has to set up
for PowerUp one time and WarpUp the other time.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Negretti means: &raquo;Amiga One will come before the G3/G4 boards do, so they will no have very many people interested
in them. The G3-board would have been a good interim solution, but now these times are (nearly) over.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Christian Aichinger doesn't believe in the release of G3/G4 boards and answers: &raquo;Well, no! In my opinion phase5 would
have been the only company with the enthusiasm that is necessary for such a project. I think, that Metabox and Escena are
neither interested nor able to port G3/G4 for the Amiga - there are already too many wiseguys in the Amiga sector.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Oliver Tacke has some self investigated informations: &raquo;Yesterday, I called Martin Schueler - and he told me, that
they are still working on the boards, even if financing the project is not too easy.&laquo;
</P>
<P>
Gernod Schomberg expects little chances for the G3/G4 cards: &laquo;I'm afraid, the announcement of the Amiga One will lower
the busyness of the manufacturers to release the cards for the old models. I would have liked to install the new Amiga
operating environment on my Amiga. But if the manufacturers offer less and release it later, I think I am going to swap
directly on the new computer and leave my A4000 as reserve.&laquo;
</P>
<P><B>Fazit:</B></P>
<P>
A majority (even if it is not a big one) expects the G3/G4 add-ons for the current Amiga to be released. But also very
many people expect this to fail. At least, if the AmigaNG is already put on the market.
</P>
