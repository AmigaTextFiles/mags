<H2>4. Reflections about the Future of Amiga PowerPC and Games (by Andreas Volkmann)</H2>
<P>
You are always on about the Mac. But what about a reasonable emulation for PPC
Amigas? There's not much on Aminet for emulation that you have not tested
already.
</P>
<P>
I bought WarCraftII and played it to the final level, but that's a long time
ago, and how much new stuff has appeared since for the PPC? And if I wait for
a Fusion upgrade will 604e boards be sufficient?
</P>
<P>
We are all are waiting for games and applications for the Amiga, but
especially the latest games (if possible). I am not a games nut, but like
real-time or round-based strategy games like Napalm, Warcraft, Ufo or Age of
Empire.
</P>
<P>
The rest don't interest me, but there are many others who might like to play
new games. :-)
</P>
<P>
I have got myself all the current emulators because I'm not just a games nut,
I need to run other programs to swap other data, but I'm stuck with a 68k Mac
emulation. I can't afford to lash out on a PPC in the hope someone will write
an emulation to take advantage of its power.
</P>
<P>
You guys get the test programs, you may say the game or the program runs in
one or other configuration, but you don't seem to have anything new. I can
only hope that a PPC emulation will pop up and I will be able to buy a good
PPC board, but I fear this will never happen.
</P>
<P>
I could upgrade my A1200 to PPC, just to run an emulation on it, or I could
buy a PowerMac -  and as it looks like there will be no boards for my A4000
and A3000. All I can say is: What a shame!
There are certainly more 1200s out there, but will they all be upgraded to
PPC? I don't think so, but I get the impression that a lot of A4000 or A3000
owners would buy a G3 or G4 board. I would probably buy two boards right
away.
</P>
<P>
I just can say: It's a pity. I'm sure, there have been sold more A1200 , but
are all of them expanded? I don't think so, but I'm sure, that those, who operate
an A4000 or A3000 and is currently waiting, would buy a G3 or G4 board. I would do
that and it is very likely, that I would buy 2 boards.
</P>

Chief editor's note: I do not see a future for the Amiga PowerPC market. New
PowerPC boards will not be here before 2001, if they arrive at all. You have
to ask who will buy these products if a new Amiga has been released by then.
The same applies to the BoXeR, promised for years, but never delivered. If the
cost of a full spec BoXeR is more than 2000 DM (1000 Euro), it won't sell.
The Mediator PCI extension might be a hit - but only if it is bugfree and up
to spec. But if only old 4 or 8 MByte graphic boards can be used with it, as
rumor has it, this project looks lame as well.
