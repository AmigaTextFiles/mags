&raquo;AMIGA INC. ANNOUNCES RELEASE OF AMIGA AUTHORIZED DEVELOPER WORKSTATION IN
NORTH AMERICA
</P>
<P>
July 13, 2000 - Amiga Inc., Snoqualmie, WA, today announced manufacturing
and distribution agreements with Wonder Computers International Inc. in
Ottawa, Canada and Software Hut, Inc. in West Chester, PA. These
agreements will allow the manufacture of Amiga Authorized Developer
Workstations in North America.
</P>
<P>
Both Software Hut and Wonder Computers are well known and well regarded
figures in the Amiga community. Their involvement dates back well over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Amiga, Software Hut and Wonder Computers share the same vision and strategy
to establish the Next Generation Amiga as the preeminent media platform and
operating environment for the future.
</P>
<P>
&quot;It gives us great pleasure to have released the Software Development Kit
(SDK) on schedule and to follow up with such excellent value to the
community with the Amiga Developer Workstation. It gives us equal pleasure
to have the support of Software Hut and Wonder Computers behind this
release. Through this developer machine, we achieve our goal of providing
excellent value in superior hardware to realize our cross platform binary
compatibility promise for developers. This will no doubt come as great
news to those in the community seeking value of their dollar as they
develop for the great number of target platforms that Amiga supports,&quot;
said Randall Hughes, Vice President, Sales and Strategic Alliances at
Amiga Inc.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We at Software Hut are extremely excited to have been selected as the
official US Distributor for the authorized Amiga Developer Workstation.
Many of our customers and dealer partners have been looking for a machine
with all the specifications to run the Amiga SDK in one bundled package.
Our combined efforts, along with Amiga Inc.'s and Wonder Computers', will
ensure that all developers will have easy and affordable access to the
tools needed to develop software that will revolutionize computing as we
now know it,&quot; said Joseph Muoio, President of Software Hut, Inc.
</P>
<P>
&quot;We are proud to be a part of this quantum leap forward in computing
technology, and look forward to working closely with Amiga and Software
Hut on this project in the weeks and months to come. The developer machine
is more than just a tool. It represents the first significant opportunity
for Amigans and former Amigans everywhere, to join forces and help bring
about a real change in the way computers work. The developers machine can
also be configured to run Amiga Legacy software through emulation, adding
further to its potential value for anyone considering a purchase,&quot;
extolled Mark Habinski, President of Wonder Computers International Inc.
</P>
<P>
The developer machine represents unparalleled value, uses brand name parts
of the highest quality, and is bundled with a comprehensive warranty on
hardware and an enhanced level of support from Amiga Inc. The workstation
also includes the Amiga SDK. &quot;We at Amiga are proud to have our name on
the Amiga Authorized Developer Workstation,&quot; said Mr. Hughes, in reference
to its significant value and competitive price. Such a price/performance
achievement is not possible using clone hardware. If it does not have the
official Amiga Boing insignia, it is not an authorized Amiga Developer
Workstation. Please see www.amiga.com for full details.
