<H2>8. Help needed for new website</H2>
<P><B>Thorsten Schoelzel writes:</B></P>
<P>
&raquo;Amiga-users, I need your help!
</P>
<P>
I don't think there's anything more important than conserving the environment
and want to start an environmental organisation. I would like to call it
&quot;Nautilus&quot;.
</P>
<P>
I figure we need a a green but grabby website. Is there anyone out there who
wants to help me create a &quot;NAUTILUS&quot; homepage??? (strictly unpaid you
understand, but saving the environment is worth it)
</P>
<P>
We also need a really nice logo - does anyone have a suitable bit of art on
their harddrive???
</P>
<H3><U>Information about &quot;NAUTILUS&quot;:</U></H3>
<P>
Because I want an environmentally oriented organization especially dedicated
to the protection of water and fighting the evil at the roots (humans!!!!),
the name NAUTILUS ought to be self-explanatory. Have a look at the movie
&quot;20.000 Leagues below the Sea&quot; to see where I'm coming from.
</P>
<P>
We're only at the planning stage, a concept has to be worked out. A web
presentation is our first step to introduce ourselves to the public.
</P>
<P>
Activities are especially directed to the region of the Niederrhein (NRW). We
will cooperate closely with other environmental organizations e.g. the
Greenpeace group Niederrhein (<A HREF="http://www.gp-niederrhein.de" TARGET="_TOP">www.gp-niederrhein.de</A>).
</P>
<H3><U>My dream homepage:</U></H3>
<P>
The &quot;NAUTILUS&quot; homepage will be graphically very appealing and support all
up-to-date standards - JavaScript, CSS ...
... an interactive area with guest book, groups as well as a news, status and
activities areas... and a way to present ourselves...
...colour of the homepage limited to several blue grades... and a white area,
where possibly a blue background picture could be used.
</P>
<P>
In case you missed the mention above, this organization cares for about water,
and the protection of water.
</P>
<H3><U>The Logo:</U></H3>
<P>
The homepage colours would flow into the logo, but apart from that the design
is up to you - circular, rectangular, triangular, octagonal ...
</P>
<P>
Please put a &copy; Copyright in the logo, which should be at a resolution of 800x600
in 24-bit. Send it to me as IFF picture.
</P>
<P>
