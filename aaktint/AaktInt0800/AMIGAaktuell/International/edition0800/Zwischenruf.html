<H1>The Heckler (by Ralf Driesner)</H1>
<P>
Don't worry, it'll sort ...... NOT
</P>
<P>
I am driving my 8 year old VW Polo on the autobahn headed to Berlin. But Berlin is not my target.... at the Hermsdorfer
Kreuz I use the Autobahn 4 heading to Gera.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Thuringian-Bavarian state border the 6-lane autobahn changes to a 4-lane small autobahn of the 30's. The bulldozers have not
made their way up to here.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, I see a Wartburg (remark of the translator: &quot;Wartburg&quot; is the name of a car, manufactured in the former
German Democratic Republic). The bonnet open .... when I passing I believe to see from the corner of the eye a person working
on the interiors of the car.
</P>
<P>
I notice, that nearly 10 years after the German reunification I think the same (stupid) stereotype thoughts about Trabbies
(remark of the translator: &quot;Trabbi&quot; is a nickname for the &quot;Trabant&quot;, another car from the former
German Democratic Republic).
</P>
<P>
When I pass by the exit Schleiz, I am frightened by this thought: No matter if street or data traffic, industrial or
service branche. Nearly four million unemployed in Germany, nearly 12 million in Euro-land (remark of the translator:
&quot;Euro-land&quot; means the countries participating the European Union) .... agreed, it's less than some years ago,
but it's still a lot.
</P>
<P>
I see politicians and chairmen empathize from a new, bright future - the Internet, E-commerce, B2B-commerce, B2C-commerce ....
but there are just a few of those prophets, who have experienced the Internet. This is at least, what I think, if I see
how childish they handle this theme. They busily learned their speech ... Well done.
</P>
<P>
The voter/consumer/worker is told, that he now may learn using the Internet ... has anyone of the &quot;Heckler&quot; readers
really tried to read the online offer of a newspaper or a longer article with 10 and more links completely? Without a
leased line, this is ridiculous  ....
</P>
<P>
Andy Grove, known from Intel said: &quot;The future belongs to the paranoid&quot;. How is this linked with the small
autobahns? Well, those in Germany (or maybe in all Europe) become paranoid, is not rewarded with a bright future.
He or she just becomes crazy ...
</P>
<P>
There are too many weaknesses, which cannot be changed by a person, even if he tries as much as he can. Many things fail,
because you don't have the right tools ... and/or you don't have the money to buy them.
</P>
<P>
The man from the German Post says in a commercial: &quot;You click ... we do the rest&quot;. That's how future is going to
be ... and hopefully not just the Deutsche Post AG.
</P>
<P>
Have a nice holiday .... I already see myself with a laptop (5,000 DEM (approx. 2551 Euros)) and lederhosen (nice Bavarian
fighter clothes with shirt and trousers and Charivari - we're tradionalists; for just 2,000 DEM (approx. 1020 Euros)). So
there's just the mobile phone missing (with Internet access).
</P>
<P>
Live long and prosper ...
